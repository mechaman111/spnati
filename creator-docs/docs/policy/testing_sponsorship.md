**Testing Admittance**

For admittance on to testing, a new character file must meet the following requirements:

-No broken images (checked by validation in the character editor)

-A minimum of **300** lines, *Including:* **10** targeted lines, directed at **5** different haracters and **10** filtered lines.

-Recommended, but not essential is the use of the "Writing Aid" button so your character reacts appropriately!

**Sponsorship**

For release into the main game, a character must pass community sponsorship:

The comprehensive guide can also be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/ar4d98/revised_sponsorship_process_effective_215/)

When a creator is ready to submit their testing table character to the main roster, they will do as follows:

 - Create a sponsorship post on Reddit, and announce it. 
 - The community will have an opportunity to give affirmative, conditional sponsorships.
 - When requisite number of sponsorships have been obtained (5 for new character, 3 for revisions), the creator will petition the moderation team, and **select** which of the sponsorships they’ve received they wish to use as basis for Mod QA. 

 - **Creators can select which sponsorships to use and address** when completing the process, as long as they select enough to meet the requirements.
 - The moderation team will perform Mod QA.
 - All flaws observed by sponsors **must** be addressed before completing sponsorship. Sponsors will be communicated with to determine if these changes have been adjusted. 
 - If successful, the character will be admitted to the core roster. If unsuccessful, the character will remain on testing tables until the creator submits them for another round of QA, or until they fall off testing tables to the offline version. 

Moving forward, consider this your template for affirmative sponsorship:


    Characters Tested: 
    New Added Values: (3, including quality dialogue, unusual but appealing models, and positive interactions)
    Flaws Observed: (Here, list whatever flaws prohibit this character from being good enough to be added to the game. If you didn't notice any flaws, please list your most wanted suggestion for a future update here)
    Discussion:
      A more fluid series of observations on what you didn’t like or liked about the character.
      This can be things such as “I don’t like that this character’s face. I think this character’s sexuality isn’t quite canon. I don’t think this character’s gimmick does anything 
      interesting, and could be frustrating to target.” 
    Suggestions: Optional suggestions for where to take the character and what to do after sponsorship. These aren't binding like the flaws observed.


The new sponsorship process will require **5** sponsorships for new characters and **3** for revisions.
These sponsorships will be _conditional_ sponsorships, meaning the flaws outlined in the post _must_ be addressed before the sponsorship process will be accepted.


A character is considered _new_ when it uses no prior dialogue or artwork from another version of the character.
A character is considered _revised_ when it encounters a substantial art overhaul, substantial dialogue update, or inheritance by a new author.
**The moderation team reserves full rights to make judgment calls on this distinction.**


The Mod QA will be as follows:

 - Validator run for broken images, misaligned targets
 - Tag-removed spellcheck, reported on the character’s Discord channel.
 - Confirmation that each sponsorship flaw has been corrected
 - At least two playtests of the character
   - Admittance to the live roster *OR*
   - return to the Testing Tables for further development

If a character is found not to meet any of the standards in Mod QA, they will be required to address those before the character can be added to the main roster.
