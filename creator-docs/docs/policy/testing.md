How to submit your character to the Testing Roster

---

## What is Testing?

Before any character can be allowed into the main game, they must undergo a period of "beta testing" as part of the **Testing Roster**. Here, community members and other developers can give prospective new additions feedback. 

Once a creator feels their character is sufficiently ready, they can begin the [Sponsorship process](/docs/policy/sponsorship.html).

## Testing Admittance

For admittance on to testing, a new character file must meet the following requirements:

- Compressed all image files. This can be done through the CE, or by uploading to [tinypng.com](https://tinypng.com/).  Note that all character sprites (not including epilogue images) must total under **11 mb**.

- No broken images (checked by validation in the character editor).

- A minimum of **300** lines, *including minimums of:* **10** targeted lines, with **5** different characters targeted in those lines, and **10** filtered lines.

- Recommended, but not essential, is the use of the "Writing Aid" button so your character reacts appropriately!

## How to Submit

The best way to send your character to Testing is through **Reddit Modmail**. First, .zip up the character folder and upload it to a file sharing site. Next, find the button on the [r/spnati subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/)'s sidebar that says **"Message the Mods"**

!!! Note
    This button is above the list of subreddit moderators.

    ![Message the Moderators](../img/testing_modmail.png)

Copy the link onto the Modmail and send it off! The mods will let you know if any further work is needed (often fixing outstanding validation errors or compressing images), or if your character has been added to test.
