            <h1>Overview</h1>
            Your character will strip in a pre-determined order, which never changes from game to game. The Wardrobe tab is where you define this order.<br />
            Each layer of clothing contains extra information about that article that other players will react to - what it covers, how much it covers, etc.<br />
            <p>This screen lists out the layers of clothing your character has, ordered in the same order that your character will remove them in.</p>
            To begin, simply start filling out the first line of the grid with the first article that will be removed.
        </section>
        <section class="card" id="layers">
            <h1>Setting Layers</h1>
            Strip order can be controlled using layers.
            <ul>
                <li><span class="label">Adding a Layer:</span> Start typing into the last row of the grid to add a new layer. There is technically no limit to the number of layers, but no existing character has more than 8, and the editor will not appreciate trying to add more than that.</li>
                <li><span class="label">Removing a Layer:</span> Click the open space to the left of a layer and press Delete to remove it.</li>
                <li><span class="label">Reordering a Layer:</span> Use the up and down arrows to move a layer around in the strip order.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="warning">
                <h5><i class="fa fa-warning"></i>Be careful changing layers after you've already written dialogue.</h5>
                Rearranging layers will also rearrange that layer's (stage's) dialogue. While you won't lose any lines (unless you delete a layer, of course), 
                it can be a real pain to update dialogue to reflect the new strip order.
            </div>
        </section>
        <section class="card" id="data">
            <h1>Layer Data</h1>
            Each layer has a few relevant pieces of information.
            <ul>
                <li><span class="label">Proper Name:</span> Capitalized name of the piece of clothing.</li>
                <li><span class="label">Lowercase Name:</span> Lowercase version of the name.</li>
                <li><span class="label">Plural:</span> Check this if the clothing is plural (ex. pants, socks, anything where one would say, "Your X are" instead of "Your X is"). This helps dialogue writers use proper grammar when reacting to your clothing.</li>
                <li><span class="label">Type:</span> How much the clothing covers. Stripping reactions are based on this type.
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="label">extra: </span>Accessories or other minor, non-clothing articles.</li>
                        <li><span class="label">minor: </span>Clothing that covers some skin, but not much. Examples: outer jacket, socks, etc.</li>
                        <li><span class="label">major: </span>Clothing that covers a lot of skin, usually revealing underwear. Examples: shirt, dress, pants, etc.</li>
                        <li><span class="label">important: </span>Clothing that covers a vital body part (chest or genitals). Typically underwear.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><span class="label">Position:</span> Where the clothing is located. This is only used for determining if an important layer is revealing a character's crotch or chest.
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="label">upper: </span>Covers the character's chest</li>
                        <li><span class="label">lower: </span>Covers the character's crotch</li>
                        <li><span class="label">other: </span>Covers some other part of the character</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
