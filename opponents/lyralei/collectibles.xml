 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"&lt;i&gt;Hey there! Remember me?
 

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;We played that little game of strip poker (which went a bit too far...) on that great beach some time ago. 

&lt;br&gt;Well, I loved that place so much that I had to visit it again with some friends.
 
Being here made me think of you… maybe we can visit it together some time? 

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

Alright, Traxex wants me to stop writing that 'stupid postcard', so I gotta go. 
Hopefully I can convince some of them to join the next game of strip poker... wouldn't that be great?! 

&lt;br&gt;They're all preeeeeetty hot! 



&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;Kisses,
 Lyralei&lt;/i&gt;" &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

        <text>A naughty picture of Lyralei's friend Traxex, the Drow Ranger. It appears to be taken in front Lyralei's forest, but it's still a mystery how this picture came to be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
