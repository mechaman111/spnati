    <othernotes>DUNBAN NOTES&lt;br&gt;- The TLDR of Dunban is that he is a mature, mostly level-headed, battle-scarred badass who is sure of himself and quite emotionally honest/straightforward.&lt;br&gt;- Dunban's arm scarring is incredibly apparent once his shirt comes off, but even before that the lack of movement in his right arm is very noticeable. He may bring up idle comments like "my arm hurts" or reference the damage it took, in a casual manner.&lt;br&gt;- Dunban is a bit of an understated warrior poet - at certain points in the Xenoblade story, he ponders the nature of existence, and his battle arts/skills imply he has a certain poetic edge.&lt;br&gt;- Dunban knows all too well the pain of loss and the desire for revenge against an individual, and has worked through his own struggles with the help of his comrades.&lt;br&gt;- Dunban's determination and sheer will is what allowed him to use the Monado, which nobody else bar Shulk could use successfully. He is so strong-willed that he was immediately willing to sacrifice his left arm as well, if it meant saving Colony 9 from a Mechon invasion.&lt;br&gt;- He is a massive softie underneath the badass persona that he presents to everybody. In SPNATI, he mostly leans towards the softer side as the game goes on, and isn't afraid of being straightforward about his intentions. But early on he might be a bit more guarded.&lt;br&gt;- Despite putting on a strong face for everyone who needs to rely on him, he doesn't like being treated like an infallable hero, and is incredibly humble about his title.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;XENOBLADE'S WORLD&lt;br&gt;- Dunban lives on the body of the Bionis. The world of Xenoblade 1 consists of two dead titans - the Bionis and the Mechonis. The two are linked by the sword of the Mechonis, lodged in the torso of the Bionis, with a location known as Sword Valley being along the sword itself. Aside from these two titans (and the fallen arm of the Mechonis), there are no other landmasses to speak of. The rest of the world is just endless ocean.&lt;br&gt;- Dunban comes from Colony 9, which is located on the Bionis' right shin. The other known colony, Colony 6, is located at the top of the Bionis' right leg. &lt;br&gt;- Dunban would have no real concept of sea travel, or of piracy - he would know what bandits are, and would likely equate pirates to bandits, but with "aquatic vessels" instead of regular vehicles.&lt;br&gt;- Dunban is a "Homs", which is the setting equivalent of Humans, but with some vague dependency on Ether (basically magic as an ambient resource. Homs can suffer from 'ether deficiency' similar to a Vitamin C deficiency).</othernotes>
