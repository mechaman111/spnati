    <description>Dwight is the nervous leader of a group of survivors. Geeky, anxious, and awkward, Dwight is not the person you'd expect to be leading in such a grim situation. But he lives to see others succeed in their work. Fueled with kindness, and a sad life of experience in hiding and pain -- Dwight gives his friends hope of escape. Given a chance, he really shines as a strong man.</description>
