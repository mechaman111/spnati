    <othernotes> - Kyoko is quiet. In her source material, she speaks only when she thinks it’s necessary and sometimes keeps silent for dozens of minutes at a time. In SPNATI, she has many lines (especially while forfeiting) where she only has internal dialogue or says nothing, and her sentences are very often short. She is firmly- but evenly-spoken.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; - Kyoko is stoic, but by no means emotionless. As a lifestyle, she deliberately hides her emotions or expresses them in a blunt or subtle way so she can’t be easily taken advantage of. She isn’t as good at hiding her emotions during the forfeit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; - She avoids vulgar language and never uses interjections (other than “hmm” and the like).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; - She is also unlikely to volunteer information about herself unprompted. I, her author, strongly encourage characters asking certain things about her, as she’s far more likely to talk about herself if someone’s asking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; - KYOKO IS ATTENTIVE and extremely observant. She picks up on the smallest details and personal tics right away. Her deductive reasoning skills are very strong as well; she almost always draws a correct conclusion based on what she sees. This is her main defining trait.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; - Despite her stoicism, she is easygoing. She can take more in stride than the average person, and in SPNATI, she is generally relaxed and in very good spirits by her standards, mostly just trying to have fun with the game. SPNATI is a chance to truly relax that she just doesn’t have in her own source material. Ironically, she’s more likely to fret over something minor (like being asked about what magazines she likes) than anything morbid or life-threatening.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; - She is interested in winning, but she doesn’t take the game super-seriously (though sometimes she jokingly pretends to).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; - On that note, she is not the slightest bit embarrassed about stripping or showing her body and is fully prepared to strip and do the forfeit. Her composure is virtually untouched even when she’s fully nude or has finished doing the forfeit in front of everyone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; - She has a dry sense of humor. It comes out a bit more during the strip poker game than usual.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; - Kyoko gets along well with people who express their emotions outwardly and even with, to some extent, ditzy people. In fact, she even appreciates emotional honesty, despite her own behavior.&lt;br&gt;     - If someone is truly dim-witted in such a way that they jump to unfounded conclusions, however, Kyoko can get truly annoyed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; - Despite appearances, Kyoko likes cute things and traditionally feminine aesthetics, particularly flowers such as roses and cherry blossoms. She takes no shame in this; rather, she is insulted by the notion that this is strange for her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; - Though Kyoko is open and unashamed about her body, her hands are the exception. She is sensitive about them and is not at all willing to talk about why she wears her gloves or take her gloves off at any point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; - She has about no experience with magic or the supernatural (other than a self-proclaimed clairvoyant with little credibility as such) in her source material, with one major exception. She claims she can “hear the footsteps of the god of death as he moves” and has some apparent ability to sense when someone is going to die or attempt to kill another person. Characters with a supernatural connection to death, the afterlife, or the undead might be sensed by her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; - Sexually, Kyoko is a bit pent-up. A few rounds into her forfeit, she becomes prone to more obvious and far lewder thoughts (and sometimes remarks) than usual, to the point of completely covering her mouth in heavy masturbation to try and hide her emotions. She may show visible evidence of physical arousal while nude pre-forfeit, which she makes few comments on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; - Kyoko starts the game bi-curious but can have a bisexual awakening if she plays with other women. The entire game, she is open to this, and acknowledges her thoughts of attraction towards other women with very little resistance; she has wondered about it before the game as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; - Kyoko has a type towards men: short and skinny with a small penis. The last detail is something she feels particular elation to seeing, and she could experience friction with particularly caustic SPH characters. She is still interested in men outside of this archetype. When it comes to women, she’s not as sure yet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; - Overall, Kyoko is inclusive with whom she plays with, expressing a non-sexual interest in even gay men and straight women. She may pay them compliments without intent to advance on them and ask gay men about male experiences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; - IMPORTANT FOR LINES TARGETING HER CLOTHING: Currently, Kyoko has no alternative costumes, but she is slated to have some in the future and the "costume" marker will indicate which costume she is using.&lt;br&gt;     - Her default (Danganronpa 1) costume has a value of 0, so lines targeting Kyoko with the conditions Not Said Marker "costume" or Said Marker "costume" value="0" will only target her default costume in the future.&lt;br&gt;     - Slated for possible development are values of the costume marker "FF" (her suit from The Day Before the Future) and "swimsuit" (from Danganronpa S, for the summer event).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; - Birthday: October 6, 199X.&lt;br&gt; - Likes: Hair braids, coffee, chocolate, cereal.&lt;br&gt; - Dislikes: Goya fruit, cilantro, instant ramen, gambling for money.&lt;br&gt; - Blood type is B, weight is 48 kg (106 lbs), chest measurement is 82 cm (32”) around.&lt;br&gt; - Japanese name kanji: 霧切 響子 (Kirigiri Kyouko).

        <note id="6">Make separate case for non-humans</note>
        <note id="3">This was the first line of dialogue ever written for Kyoko!</note>
        <note id="138">I wrote this line the first time I got high. I don't consider it high-quality enough to include in any capacity other than as April Fool's-only dialogue.</note>
        <note id="181">In-joke from the SPNATI community Discord. I, Kiki Retzorg, used a screenshot of this line as a way to announce having hit 401 lines, but the line was a little more popular than I anticipated.</note>
        <note id="328">This is also an Othello reference, just not as transparent of one as the "outflanked" line.</note>
        <note id="329">I spent way too long trying to find the proper Japanese word what Kyouko won't be easily. It's "hasamu," and it refers to capturing pieces in Othello. So, important note if anyone wants to translate this game into Japanese, I guess?</note>
        <note id="415">"I can hear them, you know. The footsteps of the god of death. … I can hear the god of death as he moves."

        <note id="428">This case is intended as a failsafe if something unusual (such as an opponent finishing) causes a moved-hair pose to be used when Kyoko hasn't moved her hair the normal way.</note>
        <note id="26">The line here mentioning how long it's been since she last wore her outfit was the 1,000th line written for Kyoko on December 8, 2022.</note>
        <note id="446">This will be expanded (hehe) into a sequence later on and be given its natural priority but for now I am leaving this as-is</note>
