        <text>"Hey there! It's me, Caulifla. I got my hands on a box of these old things since I last saw ya. Man, I haven't seen any of these in ages! You were saying that you can't sense energy, so I figured this could come in handy. And hey, why don't ya call me sometime? We'll hit up that inventory place again if we're both in the area. Catch ya later!"</text>

        <text>"Son of a bitch! Why'd no one tell me this would make me lose my top?! Ugh! That crap aside, I wanted to thank ya. I've been working hard for a wild transformation like this, and you've given me the inspiration I needed to attain this awesome power! I'm gonna kick Goku's ass for sure next time we meet! And it's all thanks to you, buddy!"</text>
        <unlock>A Saiyan gets stronger every time they're defeated, and you've defeated Caulifla four times in battle, unlocking the Super Saiyan 4 achievement as a result. </unlock>
