        <note id="1">Namely, the Steam edition of Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed, believe it or not.</note>
        <note id="11">If you want Amy to further expound on what qualities of Sonic's she finds uniquely attractive, that's a solid direction to take for her response. But if memory serves, Amy's a big believer in things like destiny and fate, and she first ran into Sonic because following her tarot cards led her directly to him. Leaning into that angle could lead into a fun interaction where a skeptical Rouge asks Amy to do a tarot reading to see who &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt; so-called "one true love" is (although admittedly, it may be tricky to pull that off and strip at the same time).
...Of course, if you don't mind branching dialogue paths, there's no reason why we couldn't handle it multiple ways...</note>
        <note id="12">Many of Rouge's lines targeting the Amy/Amy fantasies demonstrate an awfully specific knowledge of what Sonic's like in bed. While I tried to avoid wording them in a way that outright confirms that Sonic and Rouge have had sex (alternative explanations include Rouge getting the knowledge second-hand, or that she's blatantly trolling), just let me know if you'd prefer that I delete or rewrite any lines.</note>
        <note id="13">By "friends back home," the intent was to exclude Rouge and ~player~ -- but if you can't think of anyone more fitting, it's perfectly fine to default to either of them, or to say nobody at all.</note>
        <note id="14">This could go a couple of ways depending on how Amy answers. If she's good for it, then the two of them could talk plans for the outing. But if she doesn't have the disposable income, Rouge could try to talk Amy into working at Club Rouge (as a dealer, waitress, or prize fighter).</note>
        <note id="16">Referring, of course, to the events of Forces.</note>
        <note id="17">Rouge is, of course, being deliberately ambiguous as to whether she means "smash" in a sexual or an entirely literal sense. Whether Amy falls for the trap - and how any actively-being-written Smash girls want to address the accusation - I leave up to their respective writers.</note>

        <note id="21">Rouge is referring to Sally Acorn, of course. Honestly, even I'm not sure who the second princess is... I don't think it'd be Blaze, and while I'm tempted to say Elise, she and Sonic retconned themselves out of having met each other.</note>

        <note id="31">"Dexter" would be Amy's fictional boyfriend from Sonic Chronicles: the Dark Brotherhood.
 https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Dexter</note>
        <note id="33">This line's intended as a way to properly address the "Rouge slept with Sonic" thing that comes up in the Amy/Amy masturbation lines. Since Amy Rose is seemingly unquestioning and okay with it at that stage, working in that plot point earlier should make it a bit less out-of-left-field.</note>
        <note id="45">"Intercourse" (noun): communication or dealings between individuals or groups. Alternatively, short for sexual intercourse.</note>
        <note id="58">Rouge and Amy never actually went THAT far, I'd expect; she's just taking the opportunity to tease.</note>
        <note id="79">Gee, this conversation's gonna be real awkward if someone ever decides to add Shadow somewhere down the line - or, heaven forbid, Maria herself. (Apparently, Sonic X gave her age as 12 years old, so she's just within the age-up range.)</note>
        <note id="108">Since I haven't read the manga, I don't know the context -- but the "Scarlet Queen" title is from when Revy briefly takes to the stage as a dominatrix again in Ch. 101.</note>
        <note id="86">...Honestly, I'm on the fence about keeping this line.</note>
        <note id="137">I do know that there's a strong possibility that Fina was artificially created. On top of that, though, I've learned from the wiki that - as a Silvite - Fina has a piece of the Silver Moon Crystal inside her. (Or... had? I don't know how the Moon Crystals being lost in Deep Sky factors into that.)</note>
        <note id="150">Rouge has never received an official backstory about her time before becoming a treasure hunter, so between that and her criminal tendencies, I figure she'd be deliberately cagey about her past. That said, I do have a general idea of a fanon backstory I've been using for her -- so if do you feel like prying into that, her lips would be loosest during her Finished stage.</note>
        <note id="157">Granted, human!Fluttershy wouldn't have lived through the events of Green Isn't Your Color...</note>
        <note id="160">It occurs to me that the answer to this question might vary depending on whether anyone else is exposed/masturbating/finished by this point in the game.</note>
        <note id="192">Delving into matters of species presents a number of challenges from a writing standpoint -- partly because I need to make sure what I write makes equal sense for both Rouge's default skin and her eventual canon/furry one, partly because there's not really an "official" collective name for Sonic's various animal-people (as far as the video game canon is concerned), and partly because Sega's aggressively non-committal nowadays about whether Sonic's world and the human world are the same planet or two different ones. (When Rouge said humans are rare "depending on where you go," that's because Adventure-era games showed a majority-human society, while the more modern ones instead show an exclusively-furry society with Dr. Eggman as the only human character.) Still, given that this stage *is* leading into a crotch reveal, deflecting the topic with some innuendo seems appropriate.</note>
        <note id="224">I suspect the triggering line was intended to have "rouge31" instead of "rogue31" as its marker.</note>
        <note id="229">Fluttershy is welcome to wave off the proposal, of course -- but this is a good opportunity for a joint pose if you're interested.</note>
        <note id="233">I suspect the triggering line was intended to have "rouge31" instead of "rogue31" as its marker.</note>
        <note id="235">With this line, I tried to steer the conversation in a way that wouldn't require a rewrite of Sucrose's preexisting "gem unto herself" line... though that has the side effect of deflecting Sucrose's questions once again. If you'd prefer Rouge to actually address them, I can rewrite this line (and/or the next one) or have her answer frankly in a Hand (Any) case.</note>
        <note id="244">At least, as far as Sonic Adventure 2 is concerned.</note>
        <note id="251">The stereotypical example is having sex on a big pile of money (concerns of practicality and hygiene aside), but naturally, there are a lot of ways to answer - including rejecting the underlying premise, if you think that'd be the most in-character.</note>
        <note id="245">This case is set up so that any loot Rouge collected during the game disappears from her model. While the implication I'm going for is that it went into Nami's bag, I believe it should be possible for a Pose Maker pose to pull the loot assets from Rouge's folder - so, if you're so inclined, you could have Nami wearing it all instead.</note>
        <note id="266">Of course, I know that's not how that works for Kwami (just look at Nooroo); Rouge is just hypothesizing based on what she's already familiar with.</note>
        <note id="277">Full disclosure? Even I haven't settled on an answer to this question (and it'd likely change depending on whether she's in humanoid or furry form) - but either she's naturally hairless, or she waxes. Incidentally, though, there are a number of porn artists who draw Rouge with fur on her legs, and sometimes even on her back &amp; shoulders - but it's never really looked *right* to me.</note>
        <note id="298">Here's my idea on how to incorporate the joint pose for when Sucrose isn't around. That said, I haven't yet settled on what Rouge would want if Fluttershy loses, but I do have some ideas... Remind me to DM you about them. (Also, while this case is hidden for now, I'll unhide it once we've got the whole scenario planned out.)</note>
        <note id="425">The wiki tells me that Nami's mom is adoptive (and dead) -- but of course, Rouge doesn't know that.</note>
        <note id="313">I'm still debating the value of the first two lines in this case - while Rouge does make reference to the canonical style of (un)dress of other Sonic characters in her generics, they may need to change if any of the characters in question get added to SPNatI in the future. If you think dealing with that would be more trouble than it's worth, just let me know and I can delete those, leaving just the "Story" set of lines.</note>
        <note id="315">Some clarification: these would be anthropomorphic octopi (the IDW comics set a precedent for those with Mimic). And, while I'm leaving the exact details of how she resolved the situation to the imagination, Rouge *will* - if pressed - clarify that the sucker marks were simply from getting restrained, rather than anything sexual.</note>
        <note id="312">I haven't found any official dimensions for the Master Emerald - but Tikal is 95 cm (3'1") tall, and a screenshot from Sonic Adventure shows that the Emerald is roughly triple her height.</note>
        <note id="323">I suspect the marker for Perona's line should instead be "rouge12" - so if you plan to change it, please let me know.</note>
        <note id="325">I suspect the marker for Perona's line should instead be "rouge12" - so if you plan to change it, please let me know.</note>
        <note id="274">Since it seems tricky to continue this thread without also seeing Marinette's lines, I'll hold off for now - just gonna mark this case as orange so that I don't forget to follow up on it when the time comes.</note>
        <note id="345">Note to self: make custom pose later.</note>
        <note id="347">Random thought that may or may not be relevant: if EqG Fluttershy is slightly aroused by the thought of nudity beneath a skintight suit, that gives some intriguing new context to her canonical swimsuit of choice.</note>
        <note id="349">Tomoko may not be an actual NEET, but she certainly looks the part.</note>
        <note id="365">May or may not be a placeholder, depending on if I can think up a topic</note>
        <note id="366">Hidden for now - I imagine that the Medici family would come up during the course of the prior stripping sequence, but if not, I'll come up with a new target for this case.</note>
        <note id="367">May or may not be a placeholder, depending if I can come up with a topic that'd naturally lead into the whole headlessness reveal. Will likely become clearer as the conversation during the prior stripping sequences progress.</note>
        <note id="401">Not sure how in-character it would be for Heris to actually be sneaking such glances at this stage, but since Rouge likes to tease, her intention is to fluster Heris regardless of the accusation's veracity or lack thereof.</note>
