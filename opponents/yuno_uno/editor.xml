    <othernotes>Targetable Qualities&lt;br&gt;- Yuno has a small degree of experience encountering supernatural forces, namely in people who play Uno but possess weird psychic powers, and dealing with the demon known as Ziro. Additionally, he’s used to dealing with people who are highly theatrical, but possess no actual supernatural powers. He is more accepting of the idea of “other universes” than most might be able to at first, and is aware that the Inventory is essentialy a crossover world.&lt;br&gt;- Yuno takes the game of Uno very seriously, and is still trying to comprehend that it isn’t that popular in other universes. He also takes the game of strip poker more serious than he probably should. Both of these things can be mocked, or challenged by others.&lt;br&gt;- The absurdity of some of the situations Yuno can describe are noteworthy as he treats them completely seriously, as well. Such as the very concept of saving the world by playing Uno. I absolutely encourage other devs to make their characters react with disbelief, incredulously, or laugh him off, upon learning this.&lt;br&gt;- His enhanced luck can factor into the game if he’s too unlucky early on (a minor “determination” switch can be triggered). He is aware of his swings in luck through his own observations, and firmly believes in “the Hands of Chance”. Characters can ask him about personified luck, fate etc.&lt;br&gt;- Yuno cares about his three closest friends - Ayumi, Gaku, and Yanagi - a great deal, and values camaraderie a lot in his opponents. He treats their bonds as seriously as you can expect from a card game anime protagonist. Thus, it can be worthwhile to target Yuno with talk about friends, companions, brothers-in-arms, etc, as he would have plenty to say about the topic. &lt;br&gt;- He has variations on his forfeit which play in opposite circumstances: He goes quiet and starts thinking about Ayumi if he isn’t particularly “horny”, and by contrast becomes overly sexually charged if he is very “horny”. “Horniness” in this context is determined by how many major reveals have occurred in the game at the time of his own forfeit. Prying into either of these can elicit different responses from him.&lt;br&gt;- Yuno is rather clumsy in terms of trying to flirt and generally allow himself to be horny towards other characters. The intention is that he’s comfortable in his sexuality around women, but doesn’t have any real practice flirting or talking dirty. Additionally, he is bi-curious, and somewhat in denial about his attraction to men until his last 3 stages. As a result, he has even less of an idea of how to flirt with men. Both angles of this can be worth exploring if a character wanted to pry into what he is attracted to.&lt;br&gt;- Yuno fully exposes his lower half in stage 5, before revealing his chest. He's flaccid until he strips to stage 6. Could potentially be worth targeting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Things you SHOULDN'T target:&lt;br&gt;- Yuno is not actually summoning his friends or their ghosts etc. to play the game. The poses with his friends appearing is meant to mimic the card game trope of "having a flashback to something your friend said."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Background details:&lt;br&gt;- Yuno is, by appearance, an ordinary Japanese-American college student, hailing from New York but now living in Kantō with his grandparents, attenting university for a degree in History. He found his calling with a group of friends, namely the game Uno, which in Yuno’s world has had an unprecedented surge in popularity from its first launch in the 1970's.&lt;br&gt;- In Yuno’s world, Uno itself plays almost exactly as it does in real life, but is popular enough to have a semi-annual Uno League, of which Yuno won twice in a row, and had to drop out of his third running mid-tournament. There are special wrist-mounted devices called Burners which are used to play the game in an arena setting, or on-the-go.&lt;br&gt;- Games of Uno are taken very seriously, including any bets placed on the outcome of certain games. Although Yuno and his friends are not deluded and know it’s “just” the game of Uno, it’s taken with complete seriousness.&lt;br&gt;- Ayumi's closest friends are Ayumi and Gaku. They met one another during his last year in a Japanese high school, and became invested in the Uno League together. Their favourite hangout spot is a small cafe. Ayumi possesses bright blue hair in twin, crescent-shaped pigtails, and she's the heart of the friend group. Gaku wears glasses, and possesses darker green hair that spikes at the back; he's the smart guy/analyst of the gang.&lt;br&gt;- Yuno’s rivals include Taiyo (a dude with a pompadour and Yuno’s first real rival), Shiro (a guy with dark blue hair and a ponytail who warms up to Yuno), and Keiya (the main antagonist of the first Uno League tournament, who nearly beat Yuno and the others in the finals).&lt;br&gt;- Yuno has had romantic and sexual relations with Ayumi, but the two of them are taking a relationship break for a couple of months after she lost her soul to Ziro. Even though it was later returned to her, it still shook her up a bit, and she’s taking time to self-reflect.&lt;br&gt;- In addition to Ayumi and Gaku, Yuno’s other friends include Yanagi (a purple haired former rival), and Daisuke (a worrywart who has slowly become even more of a minor character as the series went on).&lt;br&gt;- In the history of Yuno’s world, there was a game suspiciously similar to Uno, played in ancient Greece. This game is called Underworld Draws. Yuno had to defeat a ‘demon’ named Ziro who used Underworld Draws games to steal the souls of many individuals, including two of his friends - Gaku and Ayumi (the green haired boy and blue haired girl). Yuno's grandmother, whom he lived with in Japan, knew about this topic and helped first provide context and backstory to Yuno and his friends once Ziro became a threat.&lt;br&gt;- Yuno and his friends believe in a force known as The Hands of Chance. These have an indirect, but noticeable, effect on the outcome of games of Uno, based on who is ‘destined’ to win a particular game. Yuno in particular seems to be favoured by this mysterious force, as he gets exceedingly good luck whenever he is in a tough situation.&lt;br&gt;- It cannot be emphasised enough that Yuno’s strongest trait is that he’s, like, really good at playing Uno competitively. &lt;br&gt;Development Choices&lt;br&gt;- Yuno is written as if he was localised by a dubbing company who kept most of the plot intact (including character names), but that tried to Americanise him more than he was in the original “anime”. Thus, Yuno speaks with a fair amount of American slang, talks about being a Christian, etc. Essentially, his American traits are emphasised more than his Japanese traits.&lt;br&gt;- Yuno is fluent in both English and Japanese as a result of his mixed heritage.&lt;br&gt;- Yuno is bi-curious at the start of the game. A game of strip poker against male opponents essentially triggers his bisexual awakening.&lt;br&gt;- Because Yuno’s source material consists entirely of a comic written as a joke, and then an animated version of a dub of said comic, there’s a lot of unknown variables as to what happened in Yuno’s life. At its core, it can be assumed that Yuno, his friends, and the adventure he has been through, borrow heavily from card game anime tropes in general.</othernotes>
