#When selecting the characters to play the game, the first line will always play, then it randomly picks from any of the start lines after you commence the game but before you deal the first hand.

#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermione=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!




#EXCHANGING CARDS
#This is what a character says while they're exchanging cards.
#The game will automatically put a display a number between 0-5 where you write ~cards~.
#These lines display on the screen for only a brief time, so it is important to make them short enough to read at a glance.

#stage-specific lines that override the stage-generic ones

4-stripped,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shipping=uncomfortable,Of course, it sounds a little risqué given our comparable state of dress…
4-must_strip_winning=apologetic,I'm out of accessories… well, time for the big ticket items then.
4-must_strip_winning,totalNaked:2-4,notSaidMarker:cake,marker:cake=uncomfortable,You know, I've found myself in some pretty weird situations lately, but I think this one takes the cake.
4-must_strip_normal=awkward,I’ve learned to appreciate the small things in life. Like the things I’ve had to strip up ‘til now.
4-must_strip_losing=shocked,How did it come to this?
4-stripping=strip,Oh well, time to bite the proverbial bullet...
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shipping=strip,I'm still kind of new to the whole concept of"shipping," but I appreciate that sentiment, Raven.


#losing tank top
5-stripped=awkward,You know, if I hadn't worn my suit to this I'd probably still be wearing pants…
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shipping=uncomfortable,Of course, it sounds a little risqué given our comparable state of dress…
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:raven_spy,marker:ravespy=apologetic,Is that supposed to bother me, Raven? I used to <i>work</i> for a spy organization, you know.
5-must_strip_winning=uncomfortable,Oh boy. Here we go then…
5-must_strip_normal=awkward,Not much of a choice here, since I don't want to give up the shield.
5-must_strip_losing=unimpressed,You know, I never did like this game.
5-stripping=strip,Okay, this is the last piece of clothing I'm comfortable with losing.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=strip,Nah, I think whatever you've been doing is working pretty well for you, Gwen.
5-stripping,totalFemales:0,totalExposed:0,saidMarker:5playing=strip,Down to my shirt already? Guess I'm having a rough time tonight.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:4-5=strip,You look like you're pretty athletic yourself, Gwen. Maybe we could trade routines?
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:2-3=strip,You want to go to the gym after this, Gwen? I guess I could show you a thing or two.
5-stripping,totalFemales:0,totalExposed:0,saidMarker:4playing=strip,First guy out of his shirt. Good thing I don't have a fragile ego or anything.
5-stripping,totalFemales:0,totalExposed:0,saidMarker:3playing=strip,You guys got me out of my shirt already? Congrats.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=strip,Hate to break it to you, Gwen, but I'm not indestructible. Maybe you're thinking of someone else?
5-stripping,totalMales:1,totalExposed:0,saidMarker:5playing=strip,If I didn't know any better, I'd say you ladies were all working together to get me out of my clothes first.
5-stripping,totalFemales:3,totalExposed:0,saidMarker:5playing=strip,Well damn. I guess I have to take my shirt off now.
5-stripping,totalFemales:1,totalExposed:0=strip,This is the last thing I can take off before things start getting a bit awkward.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shipping=strip,That's probably a good thing you don't mind, Raven, considering we're both pretty much naked in the same room.
5-stripping,totalMales:1,totalExposed:0,saidMarker:4playing=strip,You girls really know your poker, I'll give you that.
5-stripping,totalMales:1,totalExposed:0,saidMarker:3playing=strip,All right, ladies, looks like you got me. I'll take my shirt off.


#losing boxers
6-stripped=awkward,I know you all came here to see some skin, but I'm not showing you any more than this. Seriously.
6-stripped,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shipping=uncomfortable,I'm sure our respective fanbases will have a field day with this.
6-stripped,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:4-5=awkward,That's a, uh, very specific offer. I don't, I mean I'm not, um… Maybe I'll consider it?
6-stripped,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:6-8=awkward,Yeah, I'd noticed. Not that I've been looking at you! Down there, I mean. I just… don't want you to get the wrong idea.
6-stripped,totalFemales:0,totalExposed:1,saidMarker:3playing=friendly,All right, boys, which of you two is gonna be next?
6-stripped,totalFemales:0,totalExposed:1,saidMarker:4playing=friendly,All right, boys, which one of you is gonna be next?
6-stripped,totalFemales:0,totalExposed:1,saidMarker:5playing=apologetic,Not that I expect you fellas to take it easy on me. I can still come back from this.
6-stripped,totalFemales:3,totalExposed:1,saidMarker:5playing=awkward,I have to admit, this is not how I expected the night to go.
6-stripped,totalMales:1,totalExposed:1,saidMarker:4playing=uncomfortable,Why is it women always get so worked up when I take my shirt off? You'd think you've never been to a beach before.
6-stripped,totalMales:1,totalExposed:1,saidMarker:5playing=uncomfortable,You aren't, are you? The way you're all sort of staring at me, I'm starting to wonder…
6-stripped,totalFemales:1,totalExposed:1=awkward,I mean, I guess it's already a little awkward. I just don't want to be the first one naked at the table.
6-stripped,totalMales:1,totalExposed:1,saidMarker:3playing=interested,You're really going to have to persuade me if you want to see any more, though.
6-must_strip_winning=uncomfortable,All right Steve, deep breaths. You can do this.
6-must_strip_normal=awkward,Romanoff keeps telling me I need to get out of my comfort zone…I'd say this qualifies.
6-must_strip_losing=shocked,You've gotta be kidding me!
6-stripping=strip,I really have to take off my underwear? Fine.
6-stripping,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:teleport=strip,So Raven, you said you could teleport earlier, right? Any chance you could help a guy out and teleport me out of here?
6-stripping,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shipping=strip,That's probably a good thing you don't mind, Raven, considering we're both pretty much naked in the same room.


#lost all clothing
7-stripped=unimpressed,There, I'm naked. Mission accomplished. Can I go home now?
7-stripped,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:raven_spy,notSaidMarker:ravespy=awkward,If I had to choose between you spying on me later or dropping this shield right now, I'd take you spying. At least then only one person would see me naked.
7-stripped,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shipping=uncomfortable,I'm sure our respective fanbases will have a field day with this.
7-stripped,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:raven_spy,saidMarker:ravespy=uncomfortable,You're serious about that voyeurism, aren't you Raven? Ever considered getting a job at S.H.I.E.L.D.?
7-must_strip_winning=apologetic,Okay, time for the big reveal. It's not like you guys haven't given me a good show up til now, so I can't be too embarrassed.
7-must_strip_normal=awkward,This shield has saved my life countless times, but it just couldn't save my dignity tonight.
7-must_strip_losing=unimpressed,Some days you just can't catch a break.
7-stripping=strip,I'm just gonna cover my face now. It's not like that's the part of me you all want to see anyway...
7-stripping,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shipping=strip,That's probably a good thing you don't mind, Raven, considering we're both pretty much naked in the same room.

-3-stripped=uncomfortable,Please don't stare. I don't want this to be any more awkward than absolutely necessary.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:raven,alsoPlayingStage:5,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:shipping=uncomfortable,I'm sure our respective fanbases will have a field day with this.




#OPPONENT MUST STRIP
#These lines are spoken when an opponent must strip, but the character does not yet know what they will take off.
#Writing different variations is important here, as these lines will be spoken about thirty times per game.
#The "human" versions of the lines will only be spoken if the human player is stripping.

#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

#stage-specific lines that override the stage-generic ones

male_removing_accessory=friendly,You're watching a master at work here, folks.

female_removing_accessory=interested,Your ~clothing~ this time? You're a dame after my own heart.
female_removing_accessory=calm,That's exactly what I would take off if I were you.
female_removed_accessory=friendly,I can appreciate not wanting to go for the big items just yet.

#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-specific lines that override the stage-generic ones

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.
