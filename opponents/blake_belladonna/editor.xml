        <note id="20">this one seems fine to me, the wording could use a second pass maybe, but the content seems fine.</note>
        <note id="40">Napsu, feel free to have senko note that the last part of that answer was changed in a hurry, or straight up that there are cat ears under that ribbon.</note>
        <note id="68">yes the marker is a princess bride joke lol</note>
        <note id="69">she is clearly indicating the horns and such btw.</note>
        <note id="70">Both of her possible romance intrests are confident, forward, blond, dangerus and beaitful, hence the absolute trainwreck.</note>
        <note id="71">I do think this one could lead to some intresting dialogue, blake and Pryha almost never talk in canon, so while I imagine they are freinds for sure they aren't super close, Blake may not know about Pryha's spefeic struggles pior to this point</note>
        <note id="72">Yes, she's being a playful about it, but she's also indirectly trying to gauge how Pryrha feels about blake, I think it could be really fun seeing the two of them bond.</note>
        <note id="73">blake does not feel she does this, if her bow has been stripped why becomes pretty clear, though it's not subtle either way.</note>
        <note id="74">this is just our book targets, but given monika panty flashes here it seemed like a more amusing way to open, seeing blake wrongfooted is always funny.</note>
        <note id="75">this is placed early for a reason, i figure she isn't quite willing to talk about Adam yet but there could be other conversation here, and him hinted at.</note>
        <note id="76">If revy can respect the spine shown they might end up talking more aimbly, but blake ain't gonna take shit laying down.</note>
        <note id="77">Blake stretching here is of note, i explictely have no poses where her eyes are closed in her first 3 stages, so this is an exception because she feels less threatned by Leon, and given his combat and life expreince, i imagine he can tell that.</note>
        <note id="78">Hopefully it's clear, but while he may be too caring for his own good, she's very drawn by it, and it may or may not be the main reason he's getting so much from her.</note>
        <note id="79">There is a degree of sinceirty to her words, but she's hardly responding with a grin either.</note>
        <note id="80">I'm perfectly happy for them to have postive interactions down the line, but Samus did misstep here lol, which is good, i think it's fun.</note>
        <note id="160">blake is onto her lmao, well, has a notion at least, she doesn't intially assume someone as wack as darkness would exist lol.</note>
        <note id="82">Rwby is pronunced 'Ruby' btw.</note>
        <note id="83">As we've confirmed, she's lying out her ass, this could be a good chance for Ahri to prove to blake her powers work.
Blake feels a mixture of, anxiety, lust, secruity and a slight amusement/smugness when she has the smut book open, as well as, of course, the loniness/desire for a real romance of her own that we discussed.
Blake is closed off and guarded, so her learning/trusting that Ahri can already sense her feelings could lead to an intresting dynamic.</note>
        <note id="87">blake isn't trying to be mean here lol.</note>
        <note id="88">I wish I could convey this better in posing, but blake was very put off for a moment, then recovered her stride and said this with, not malice, but a degree of defensive/cutting sarcasm that's heavier then usual, she's not thrilled.</note>
        <note id="89">the you could tell is a note on the the way fighters can pick each other out easily.</note>
        <note id="90">we've got a strip stage before meia's next adress, i'm happy for this to take up both if you want.</note>
        <note id="15">Ruby is prounced exactly the same as RWBY.
Though, the second time she says RWBY she says each letter (yes i should puncicate that, but this line barely fits as is lol)</note>
        <note id="91">Ruby is prounced exactly the same as RWBY.
Though, the second time she says RWBY she says each letter (yes i should puncuate that, but this line barely fits as is lol)</note>
        <note id="93">I saw your 'vulpinexcannine' line to ahri, and i thought it was fun, so yes, even sucrose can probably tell there is some horny here.
Though *do not* be *that* forward with blake, she is a much softer more skittish girl then ahri lol.</note>
        <note id="94">sorry for the first target being so hostile lol!
I love Nadia and I'm actually super looking forward to targetting her more!</note>
        <note id="95">Yes, definate implication that she's dealt closely with those who don't, maybe even been close with them.</note>
        <note id="96">I am considering toning this back, it's said very very playfully.</note>
        <note id="108">She's tossing up the positive merits of such a power in a freind or new freind versus her feeling of breached privacy, it's a pair of very opposed feelings, but she is warming to Ahri and the thought of that power in a freind more then not.</note>
        <note id="109">But she can't help a hint of envy, she's also conamplative on how much she would change, if she felt she could.</note>
        <note id="110">She has started to move through this issues on her own, but she's looking for validation, and maybe some new wisdom.</note>
        <note id="107">I'll mark the two/multi parters by giving them a number, don't respond to those in a way that could cause blake to change tack, ie, with a question.</note>
        <note id="111">Don't respond to this line in a way that would cause blake to change tac, eg, with a question, it's a two parter.</note>
        <note id="118">i'm trying to go for the strong silent implication 'even though i totally just called your bluff, I didn't push you on the orginal point because I don't want you to be uncomfortable'.</note>
        <note id="130">just noting that i feel like i need a less standoffish think pose, blake is musing and chatting, not unhappy.</note>
        <note id="131">in both versions blake is lightly flirting and talking about sex, the top just made her slip up and be a bit more blunt lol.</note>
        <note id="132">the 'if we let it' note is deeply bitter and personal, she's dripping venom as she says it, and seems to be tacked on last mintue as a dark thought struck a much more uplifting train of thought.</note>
        <note id="142">Ideally I'd like Noire to push Blake a little on this later on, in a gentle concerned way, blake seems halfway to wanting to talk about it and not wanting to.</note>
        <note id="143">i'm debating wether this should be at noire starting to masturbate or final strip, blake likes noire enough to say it in either.</note>
        <note id="144">I do think Nami and Blake could get along well, Blake isn't trying to get nami to go away or anything, she's just not going to open up in the first part of the first interaction.</note>
        <note id="154">i did lean on the curt side for the response so as to feed into your next line and not reslove things a bit before then.</note>
        <note id="156">We don't want to drag down the mood of course, but it's worth noting that blake has mentioned an ex a few times, but notion of such idealistic and pure hearted sex is still odd to her, an idea found in books, not for non con reasons but just because it was always more about sex with her ex, he's not exactly a gentle sort to put it mildly. I imagine arueshalae is pretty keyed into that kind of subtext which is why i made the note.</note>
        <note id="157">im still not settled on a pose, but he did fluster her just a tad.</note>
        <note id="158">Nagatoro is a tease, you can have her notice how carefully blake picks her words here to lie by omssion if you want.</note>
        <note id="159">Feel free to have this lead into more honest to god masturbation dialogue back and fourth, i'm of the opion spanti could use more of that.</note>
        <note id="161">i tried to pick the most postive pose for this, she's not saying complicated in a bad way but in a smitten way.&lt;br&gt;Also i'm down af for this to get sappy and shippy, blake likes cheryl's vibe, and i'm a big fan of sexier dialogue between characters in the later stages, there isn't enough of that.</note>
        <note id="162">You may want to shuffle some of these around, i've reduced her expostion a lot, the best place to say this is now in stage one stripping.&lt;br&gt;this isn't the ideal place to leave this, if you leave off with something a bit open ended i'll pick up with that the next time blake loses.</note>
        <note id="164">she is lying</note>
