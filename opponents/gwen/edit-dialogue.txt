#When selecting the characters to play the game, the first line will always play, then it randomly picks from any of the start lines after you commence the game but before you deal the first hand.
start=0-start,Strip poker? Well, this is just one alternate universe, so why not.
start=0-start,Wow, look at all these ladies and gentlemen. This is a weird crossover world, but hey, let's have some fun.


#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermione=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!




#POKER PLAY
#This is what a character says while they're exchanging cards and commenting on their hands afterwards.
#When swapping cards, the game will automatically put a display a number between 0-5 where you write ~cards~.
#These lines display on the screen for only a brief time, so it is important to make them short enough to read at a glance.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written
swap_cards=normal,Yikes. ~cards~.

#losing hood
0-must_strip_winning=confident,Awright, awright, folks. Time to show you... The effects of a light breeze.
0-must_strip_winning=horny,The perks of having an unnecesary hood, am I right?
0-must_strip_winning=excited,Hm. I can just lower the hood, right?
0-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:uravity=happy,Well, <i>The</i> Spider-Woman where I’m from. <i>The Notorious</i> Spider-Woman in the Bugle and on my mixtape.
0-must_strip_normal=confident,You know, given that I'm not far ahead, I'm gonna be a bit defensive.
0-must_strip_normal=happy,So, the costume counts as one object, huh? <i>Just kidding, put your boners and vulvas away, please. No, seriously. Please.</i>
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:chun-li=shocked,Heh, kind of. I grew up with him, but he uh, didn't become Spider-Man in my timeline.
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:chun-li=shocked,Hey, that's kind of offensive. I didn't ask if you're related to Ryu just because you're from the same admittedly kick-@#$ franchise!
0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:uravity=happy,Well, <i>The</i> Spider-Woman where I’m from. <i>The Notorious</i> Spider-Woman in the Bugle and on my mixtape.
0-must_strip_losing=sad,Okay, so, for some <i>weird</i> reason, I'm losing already. So, let's just play this game a little slower, yeah?
0-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:uravity=happy,Well, <i>The</i> Spider-Woman where I’m from. <i>The Notorious</i> Spider-Woman in the Bugle and on my mixtape.
0-stripping,marker:canon=stripping,Just so we're clear, this is all <i>not</i> canon.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:annie,priority:101=stripping,Well, Annie, as a <i>budding</i> superhero, I guess you'll find out...
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:uravity=stripping,Well, that’s kinda obvious, ain’t it? <i>Or maybe under my mask I’m a horrible mix of woman and widow! Ooooo~</i>
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=stripping,Whoa, seriously? They have those here? Dude. Pit. I gotta see if they make me look fat or insecure.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:gwen_comfort=stripping,What? The point of the suit is that it’s comfortable. Priorities, woman!
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:chiaki=stripping,Mayyybe, Chiaki, you'll have to wait a little bit longer...!
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:gwen_spiders=stripping,Aww, we get such a bad rap. Spiders are pretty nice, once you let them take up residence. Except Spider Jerusalem. He’s kind of universally a %$@#.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:gwen_style=stripping,Hey, you like armor, Meia, I like faceless masks with pink outlines on the eyes. Tomato <i>ta-</i>mato.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:captain_america=happy,Oh yeah, I'm the Gwen Stacy that lived, and then became Spider-Woman.

1-stripped=stripped,And there we go. Now all of you can get a nice long look at my mask. Pretty hot, right?
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:annie,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=stripped,...Next time, Annie.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:rinkah=stripped,It's a mask, Rinkah. The whole "little grey men" look isn't my jam.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:chiaki=stripped,Well, wait a round, and then I'll give you a secret worth keeping, 'kay, Chiaki?
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:annie,count-pit:1=stripped,Well, pardon you for <i>bud</i>ding in, then, Pit.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity=stripped,Pfft. <i>Stick around</i>, Ms. Uravity, or Zero Gravity, or whatever. I’ll show you a few tricks of my own.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:captain_america=stripped,Oh yeah, tons of Spider-Whatever's out there. Spider-Man, Man-Spider, Spider-Pig, y'know, tons of us. Kinda like actual spiders! Just less furry. Mos'ly.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=confident,Shucks, they <i>do</i> make me seem insecure, don't they, Pit? Well, I'll just go ahead and whip out my bits, and that'll be that.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=stripped,Pffft. Would an insecure vigilante-superhero get naked in front of strangers for accolades? Reports say: maybe!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=stripped,Seriously. If you have a copy I'm <i>dying</i> to see it.
1-must_strip_winning=sad,Well, looks like various other blackmail-able material from blackmail-able folks is out, so... I guess I can...
1-must_strip_winning=confident,Look, this mask is more than just a cover. It's like a badge. It lets me do what I need to get done.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:captain_america=confident,Sure am! Queens represent!
1-must_strip_normal=horny,This'll be a particularly rad diary entry, won't it?
1-must_strip_normal=happy,Okay, gonna have to trust y'all that my perky and sunny disposition is enough to get you to not blab about this everywhere.
1-must_strip_normal=confident,%&$#. Well. Scout's honor this doesn't leave here, right?
1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:captain_america=confident,Sure am! Queens represent!
1-must_strip_losing=sad,W-what? Oh come on, seriously? Really? You want me to just reveal my identity? Because Dealer gave me a bad hand?
1-must_strip_losing=confident,I'm really going to have to remind you. This is <i>not</i> canon. And this is absolutely an <i>alternate</i> universe. <i>Got it?</i>
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:captain_america=confident,Sure am! Queens represent!
1-stripping=stripping,Here goes...
1-stripping=stripping,This is never particularly fun to remove...
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=stripping,Okay, Streaming-chan, <i>or whatever your real name is</i>, I'm gonna web over that camera now...
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:chun-li=stripping,Well, I got a feeling you're not just gonna start whupping me in a one on one match, so I trust ya, Chunners.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:chun-li=stripping,Well, Chun-Li, 's long as you ain't gonna arrest me, I think we're gonna be fine.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:captain_america=stripping,Heh. Yeah... that must be your universe's Peter Parker...
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:uravity=stripping,Well, perspective on that’s kind of a #$@%, Uravity... But I’d say I’m a hero. My mask is my badge, insert quotes on justice here, et cetera.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:april,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=stripping,And thank goodness for that, April. At least I can swing back to my own Earth even if you did!


#losing top
2-stripped=stripped,Honestly, the mask breathes really well. Part of me wonders if I shouldn't have saved it for last... I guess I'm a bit limited on my gimmicks, heh?
2-stripped=stripped,Okay. So, that's probably the worst part of tonight over.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:april,alsoPlayingStage:0-5,count-pit:1=stripped,It really <i>is</i> that strong, Pit. Wanna see?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:marinette,saidMarker:mlb,count-pit:1=angry,You know MLB, my friends call me-- I'm sorry <i>Pit</i>, was I interrupting something?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:annie,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=horny,<i>MJ?</i> In the Spiderverse? Get outta here, Annie!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=excited,Quick, Amalia! Roll fortification! I'll sneak attack ya for... well, I'm a vigilante, hold on, my tabletop skills ain't really up to...
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:sei=stripped,I wouldn't say <i>romantic</i>, but I appreciate the sentiment, Sei!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=stripped,"Against contract?" Whaddya mean, <i>webbing her camera is against contract!?</i>
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity=confident,What? When I say stuff like *@&#, @!&^, or *&%@? Trust me, it takes a <i>lotta</i> work to get that pronunciation down.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:joey=shocked,Yeesh, Joey. Ya don't need to rub it in, y'know?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:joey=shocked,Whaaat? The Mary Janes? Famed drummer Gwen Stacy? None of that?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:faye=stripped,I'm glad we have each other at the same rough priority level, Faye. I got bigger fish to sashimi, after all.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:april,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=shocked,Huh? Who did you think I was going to be, April?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:kyoko,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=excited,Oh yeah, Kyoko? What was? Dish.

2-stripped,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:0-1,marker:mlb=stripped,You know MLB, my friends call me Gwen. And I have a feeling we’re gonna be <i>great</i> friends.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:akko,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=shocked,Aww, come on, I humored you about "Shiny Chariot," you can't at least recognize the awesomeness that the Mary Janes drummer is?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:akko,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=shocked,Okay, okay, good joke, Akko, but everyone knows about the Mary Janes and their famous drummer, right?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:captain_america=sad,He uh, didn't make it in my world.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:2-10=stripped,You know Marinette, my friends call me Gwen. And I have a feeling we’re gonna be <i>great</i> friends.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=shocked,Um, because it's a <i>secret</i> identity?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=stripped,Eh, Meia, no reason for me to be coy now, but every little bit helps.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:kyoko,alsoPlayingStage:0-4,count-pit:1,marker:unpleasant=sad,Yeah? Like that time I was wrong inside because of the symbiote? That was unpleasant...
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:april,alsoPlayingStage:0-6,count-pit:1=sad,Yo dawg, I heard you liked masks, so I put a mask under your mask so you can hide your emotional facade from crippling insecurities resulting from finding out your powers were an accident and ultimately unable to to protect the person who should’ve received them from dying in a destructive rampage.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:marinette,saidMarker:mlb=stripped,You know MLB, my friends call me Gwen. And I have a feeling we’re gonna be <i>great</i> friends.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:blake_crush=stripped,You know, I have a feeling we <i>could</i> be <i>special</i> friends, Marinette. But I think you’re a bit hung up on miss dark and gothy over there...
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,count-pit:1=happy,I really hope ya mean on the internet, Pit. Ya kinda look like you’re wearing a diaper, there.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:chun-li=stripped,Thanks, Chun-Li. I appreciate the nuance.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=stripped,Yeesh, can you imagine how easy this must be to draw when you don’t need explicit facial features? I’m like one of those Greys, man.
2-must_strip_winning=confident,Have the rest of you considered playing less risky things? You're kinda sucking at this.
2-must_strip_winning=horny,Okay, okay, you're gonna see the vague outlines of my boobs. Keep breathing.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:uravity=shocked,Huh? We’re speaking English, aren’t we, Uravity?
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:sayla=horny,You know, Sayla, thanks for amending the rulebook. It's great to know full-body stuff can count as two pieces!
2-must_strip_normal,marker:technicalities=happy,Costume counts for two. I read the manual before I came in. Check with a... Sayla Mass for setting the precedent.
2-must_strip_normal,marker:bodysuit=angry,The top part of this is always a pain to get off.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:uravity=shocked,Huh? We’re speaking English, aren’t we, Uravity?

2-must_strip_losing,marker:bodysuit=horny,It's getting kinda toasty in here. Jeez, how are the rest of you not boiling up?
2-must_strip_losing,marker:bodysuit=confident,What? I just took off my mask. Everyone sees more than this at the gym. Or your momma's house. <i>Eyyy!</i>
2-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:uravity=shocked,Huh? We’re speaking English, aren’t we, Uravity?
2-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:sayla,marker:technicalities=horny,You know, Sayla, thanks for amending the rulebook. It's great to know full-body stuff can count as two pieces!
2-stripping=stripping,I have to admit, this suit fits super well under a jacket and skirt. It's so much easier to get into that than you'd imagine.
2-stripping=stripping,...Anyway, I put my clothes on like a normal person, I just take them off like a weirdo.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:uravity=stripping,Wait, hold up, why’d you say we were speaking Japanese?
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:marinette,priority:101=stripping,Disappointed, Marinette? The only time I’ve ever had to take it all off at once--
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=stripping,You definitely should, Pit. You’re a bit… Um. This wouldn't really fit you...

3-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:0=sad,I think it’d be *$%# rad, Pit. Give it to him Palutena!
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity=angry,I mean, I’m done taking off the top part of my suit... But why won’t you answer the question, Ochako!?
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:marinette,marker:gwenom_prelude=stripped,--Well, the only time I <i>wanted</i> to… Is a story for later!
3-must_strip_winning,marker:spiderfacts=confident,You guys want to hear a stupid fact?
3-must_strip_winning=horny,Okay, okay, fine, you can have the rest of the suit too.
3-must_strip_normal,marker:spiderfacts=horny,So, this might take a bit of time. I'm not content with you all awkwardly staring at me, so here's an awkward fact of my own!
3-must_strip_normal=happy,Can I web the ceiling? Not that I need it right now, but you're all... Staring.
3-must_strip_normal=confident,What a day not to wear underwear... <i>Jeez</i>, you're gullible.
3-must_strip_losing=sad,Oh, damn it. I'm up again?

3-stripping=stripping,Ugh. <i>Don't worry, Gwen, your spider-sense will make it easy. You definitely don't need to put the cute stuff on, just be comfortable.</i>
3-stripping=stripping,Do you know how hard it is to get out of skin-tight lycra while people are watching? Jeez.
3-stripping,saidMarker:spiderfacts=stripping,I basically have to shave my legs or the costume sticks to them. So, you know, be careful what you wish for.
3-stripping,saidMarker:spiderfacts=stripping,I ended up getting the nano-scale webshooters from Wasp. Like, is this what boob implants or hairplugs are for normal people?

3-stripping,alsoPlaying:uravity=stripping,What, are you checking me out, Uravity? Not that I really mind…
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit,notSaidMarker:spiderfacts=stripping,Oh definitely, gimme a look at dat #@$! Just what a girl needs to start her day.

4-stripped=stripped,Congrats, you found out my secret identity and got my costume off in about ten minutes. I gotta admit, that's pretty smooth.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity=stripped,I do my own repairs. Some people criticize making webbing patterns. I criticize their need to be judgmental on a poor, single, female crimefighter just trying to find joy in the little things.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:rinkah=stripped,Well, Rinkah, I'd like to think I'm a lady. Mostly. But also part spider. It's complicated!

4-stripped,alsoPlaying:marinette=stripped,Buuut, beat me in another hand, Marinette, and I’ll tell you all about it.

4-must_strip_winning=excited,Wait, it can't be me! I'll have to... Oh. Wait, I'm definitely not the first to do this. Fine, fine.
4-must_strip_winning,marker:gwenom=sad,Well, okay, storytime. Once upon a time, a certain vigilante-rockstar-superhero lost her powers.

4-must_strip_normal=horny,Ugh. I don't like showing off my tits if I'm not in the crowd at a show. Definitely not something I do when <i>I'm on stage.</i>
4-must_strip_normal=happy,Weird. Can the rest of you figure out if you're going fast or slow? It's hard to catch the beat.
4-must_strip_normal=confident,Face it tiger, you hit the jackpot.

#Writing different variations is important here, as these lines will be spoken about thirty times per game.
#The "human" versions of the lines will only be spoken if the human player is stripping.

-1-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:3=sad,Huh, you know, you put the goods up first, and then the rest gets kinda boring.

-1-female_must_strip,targetStage:1,filter:american=excited,What part of the country are you from, ~name~? It's always great to see a fellow American. Let's win this for the Stars and Bars!
-1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:4=angry,You know, Futaba, I’ve heard of a hacker group called Lizard Squad. That’s in horribly poor taste.

-1-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:1=angry,Sayla? Like, sailor? Wait, is this a joke?
-1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:4,marker:mary_janes=happy,Since you’re gonna let me borrow your jacket, Marinette, why don’t I do my diligence and send a Mary Janes T-shirt your way?
-1-female_must_strip,target:sayla,targetStage:0=happy,Thanks again for the rules clarification, Sayla. I'd hate to have taken off my suit in one go.
-1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:3=happy,Hmm, you know, State-side, friends like to steal jackets from each other.
-1-female_must_strip,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=shocked,Huh. You know, there's not really an Avengers-type group in my dimension.
-1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:2=confident,What’s a fellow bug-themed superhero to do?
-1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:1=happy,You have some pretty eyes, MLB, I gotta admit, the domino mask thing seems kinda silly, but you pull it off! Literally, it seems.
-1-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=excited,You know, Sei, I don't see a badge on you.
-1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:7=horny,So… Marinette, remember when I offered to show you the ropes?
-1-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=excited,As one amateur detective to another, I gotta wonder what the mystery of those gloves are.
-1-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:2=sad,Impossible? Seven, babe.

-1-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:0=happy,Huh. You’re equipped for… Well, everything!
-1-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:2=shocked,I still can’t get over this chick. I wear a mask, I fight crime, I have lies told about me in the paper.
-1-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:3=normal,So, why Zone-tan? The Japanese girls I know always use -han as the end syntax.
-1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=shocked,Whoa, say,  you don’t use that to grapple about, do you, Marinette?
-1-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:0=normal,Combadge? Like a cell phone?
-1-female_must_strip,target:kim,targetStage:4=happy,Yo, Kim. You look kinda like my good buddy, Mary Jane.
-1-female_must_strip,target:seven,targetStage:1=shocked,"Discard?"
-1-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2,marker:hotdogs=happy,Speaking of realism, it's a shame this dimension doesn't have the same levels of tech as mine. I could really use a couple of hot dogs. And no, that's not a euphemism.




#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

#fully clothed

0-male_removed_accessory=angry,You can do better than just… ~Clothing~, ~name~.
0-male_removed_accessory=sad,I mean, 'cause you're only gonna have one or two accessories, right?
0-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=happy,I mean, I <i>am</i> my own weapon. That and the webshooters. So I'm guessing you didn't come completely unarmed?
0-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=happy,I <i>love</i> that game. Can you show me how to use orbitars after this? Shooting <i>two</i> bad guys at once... With webs? Rad.

0-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:4=shocked,Uh, not to be confused with The Hulk, <i>senior</i>.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:1=happy,Also a little more male, and a lot less featured in every comic I read growing up.
0-female_removing_accessory=angry,What? That's all?!
0-female_removing_accessory=shocked,<i>No!</i> ~name~, I trusted you to be the cool girl!
0-female_removing_accessory=horny,You know, ~name~, you have a name that's fun to say. I hope I'm gonna say it more, because just an accessory like your ~clothing~ isn't what I expected of you.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=sad,But I know an Scots-Irish woman when I see one. "Woman," anyway. Not a complete tittymonster. You get it.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=normal,Or are they like ears?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=confident,You remind me of me! Well, like, high school me.

0-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2,marker:are_we_boring_d.va=sad,I'd hope we're less boring than your shows, D.Va.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=excited,Though I like the whole magical girl theme thing you’ve got going on. It’s a little less rough and tumble than what I usually work with.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=sad,Aww, how’re you gonna get around now?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:0=excited,What type of instrument do you play? I'm guessing drums. Please tell me drums.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=horny,It would be so <i>weird</i> if she happened to be <i>that</i> Kyu Sugardust, you know...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:kim,targetStage:2=normal,And you just, just what, start a GoFundMe in high school? Put it all over your college apps?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:daphne,targetStage:0=happy,Those shoes can't be comfortable. How can you chase the bad guys without good footwear?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:0=normal,Not that I mind that you didn't wear it. It does make it hard to show off those... Power bombs of yours.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=shocked,Wait, like, wait harder, foot fetishism is still a thing?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=sad,Does MEKA not provide you with a full outfit?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0=angry,Are you with the Hand?! I know kung fu! Stay back!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:1=happy,It's hi-tech how you can see the cameltoe but not the nipples. Kinda sexy.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:meia=happy,What kinda work are you in? Something superhero-y.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1=normal,Because you have a military outfit that's pink.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=confident,Or a Scarlet Witch... I'm pretty sure there's a Doctor Strange, but not someone like you.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=happy,Though, I consider my mask my badge. I just hope you're a good cop.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:seven,targetStage:0=sad,That seems a little inconvenient? Why not just use bluetooth?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:shego,targetStage:2=happy,But you really seem to want to go for the humiliation thing.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=excited,Oh, you're portaling in some new stuff. Gotcha, gotcha.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:0=confident,But a girl's gotta wonder: What're you wearing that counts as two?
0-female_removed_accessory=angry,You can do better than just… ~Clothing~, ~name~.
0-female_removed_accessory=angry,Fine, I guess your ~clothing~ fits the spirit if not the fun of the game...
0-female_removed_accessory=confident,Really putting on a show, huh, ~name~?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=confident,I get the feeling you try your best, at least. I come from a line of police, so, you know, kinda a significant spot.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=sad,Crazy good fighter and scumbag though.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=shocked,Before the radioactive spiders, genetic experiments, and dimensional hopping... You’ll get there!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1=confident,...You’re not gonna unload a can of whoop$#@? Phew.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:2=confident,Is this all some sort of code name or secret identity exercise for you?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:1=happy,What's up your sleeve? I mean, if you were wearing any.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:seven,targetStage:1=confident,Though maybe Seven likes to reach for her boobs in a socially acceptable manner?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:3=shocked,I say. In my web-themed spider costume. Or, um, my numerous Mary Janes band shirts.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:2=sad,Hmm… Well, in light of that, gloves aren’t a <i>bad</i> choice for a second item.

0-female_removed_accessory,target:meia=angry,...Or maybe you’re a villain.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:kim,targetStage:3=horny,That’s some great marketing or some crazy therapy sessions in the making.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:daphne,targetStage:1=sad,Don't tell me it's all fake! Say it ain't true, Daph!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:2=confident,No duh, Daisy, those are super cute. Plus, the flower theme for a sporty princess named after a flower? Classic. I can't get away with web patterns, but I respect you keeping in theme.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:3,marker:d.va_cheats_maybe=angry,Situational awareness? D.Va? Were you getting information from someone else? You know, <i>cheating</i>?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=angry,What is this, the '90s? 'Cause that's pretty old school. Aren't you a bit more modern, <i>D.Va?</i>
0-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=shocked,Or are you more of a mercenary? I might have ethical issues with that.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit=confident,I kind of agree with Pit. If you can't just fit it in the suit, maybe it's best not to bring it?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit=happy,Oh, I agree with Ochako! A utility belt would be cool if it, you know, it didn't totally cramp your style.

0-female_removed_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:1=excited,That said, I get what it's like to have people not believe you're a girl in a getup like that orange armor. There's about a billion Spider-Men but only one Spider-Gwen.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=normal,Gotta say, big fan of <i>Heir of Grief</i>. Great music.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:samus=confident,Is this because of Justin Bailey? To show off you are in fact <i>quite</i> the woman?

-3-female_removed_accessory,target:daphne,targetStage:1=sad,Don't tell me it's all fake! Say it ain't true, Daph!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:3=shocked,I say. In my web-themed spider costume. Or, um, my numerous Mary Janes band shirts.

-2-male_removing_accessory=happy,That better be a prelude to something better, ~name~!
-2-male_removing_accessory=sad,Dude, how did you even have that?
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:3=sad,So why’d’ya gotta carry around such a hulkin’ belt like that?
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=confident,From <i>Kid Icarus</i>? Dude. <i>Dude.</i>
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:1=horny,I can definitely see why my dad would've never let me read stuff with you in it...
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=normal,She’s my Earth’s Captain America.
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_falcon,alsoPlaying:captain_america,marker:kissing_captains=horny,Can you two, like... Kiss?
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=shocked,So uh, not to pry, but why didn't you bring any weapons to this?
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:0=horny,You're a bit more bombastic than the Cap I know and love.
-2-male_removed_accessory=horny,Look, if you wanna see the real sexy stuff, you're gonna have to impress me, ~name~.
-2-male_removed_accessory=angry,I can't believe you still had your ~clothing~ left. Good plays, dude. Nice strategies.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:2=confident,And I bet she could even kick your butt.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_falcon,targetStage:1=happy,Also a little more male, and a lot less featured in every comic I read growing up.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:captain_america,targetStage:4=shocked,Uh, not to be confused with The Hulk, <i>senior</i>.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=happy,I <i>love</i> that game. Can you show me how to use orbitars after this? Shooting <i>two</i> bad guys at once... With webs? Rad.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=happy,I mean, I <i>am</i> my own weapon. That and the webshooters. So I'm guessing you didn't come completely unarmed?
-2-female_removing_accessory=excited,Whoa, ~name~, your ~clothing~ is gonna be a bonus to whatever you're really stripping, right?
-2-female_removing_accessory=horny,You must be really excited, ~name~, if you're just taking that off...
-2-female_removing_accessory=shocked,Whoa, ~name~’s kicking my $%#@ here.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:1=happy,It's hi-tech how you can see the cameltoe but not the nipples. Kinda sexy.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:0=confident,But a girl's gotta wonder: What're you wearing that counts as two?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=confident,You remind me of me! Well, like, high school me.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=normal,Or are they like ears?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=sad,But I know an Scots-Irish woman when I see one. "Woman," anyway. Not a complete tittymonster. You get it.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:0=normal,Not that I mind that you didn't wear it. It does make it hard to show off those... Power bombs of yours.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=sad,They’re just so… Blah. Where’s the individuality?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=excited,Though I like the whole magical girl theme thing you’ve got going on. It’s a little less rough and tumble than what I usually work with.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:daphne,targetStage:0=happy,Those shoes can't be comfortable. How can you chase the bad guys without good footwear?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2,marker:d.va_bunny_girl=confident,I thought they were part of the whole "cute bunny girl" outfit.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2,marker:are_we_boring_d.va=sad,I'd hope we're less boring than your shows, D.Va.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=happy,Though, I consider my mask my badge. I just hope you're a good cop.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=confident,Or a Scarlet Witch... I'm pretty sure there's a Doctor Strange, but not someone like you.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=shocked,Wait, like, wait harder, foot fetishism is still a thing?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=sad,Does MEKA not provide you with a full outfit?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:seven,targetStage:0=sad,That seems a little inconvenient? Why not just use bluetooth?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:kim,targetStage:2=normal,And you just, just what, start a GoFundMe in high school? Put it all over your college apps?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=normal,Oh, sorry, Matt Murdock. “The Devil You Know,” my spidery butt.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0=angry,Are you with the Hand?! I know kung fu! Stay back!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=horny,It would be so <i>weird</i> if she happened to be <i>that</i> Kyu Sugardust, you know...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1=normal,The uh, lawyer I rely on is not a great person.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=excited,Oh, you're portaling in some new stuff. Gotcha, gotcha.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:meia=happy,What kinda work are you in? Something superhero-y.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:0=excited,What type of instrument do you play? I'm guessing drums. Please tell me drums.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:shego,targetStage:2=happy,But you really seem to want to go for the humiliation thing.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1=normal,Because you have a military outfit that's pink.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=sad,Aww, how’re you gonna get around now?
-2-female_removed_accessory=angry,Thanks for the compliment. Not.
-2-female_removed_accessory=happy,~name~, I'm open to all kinds of things. But you taking that off isn't doing it for me?
-2-female_removed_accessory=horny,Got anything better to do, ~name~?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:meia=angry,...Or maybe you’re a villain.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:seven,targetStage:1=confident,Though maybe Seven likes to reach for her boobs in a socially acceptable manner?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:2=confident,No duh, Daisy, those are super cute. Plus, the flower theme for a sporty princess named after a flower? Classic. I can't get away with web patterns, but I respect you keeping in theme.

-2-female_removed_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:1=excited,That said, I get what it's like to have people not believe you're a girl in a getup like that orange armor. There's about a billion Spider-Men but only one Spider-Gwen.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=sad,Crazy good fighter and scumbag though.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=angry,What is this, the '90s? 'Cause that's pretty old school. Aren't you a bit more modern, <i>D.Va?</i>
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=confident,I get the feeling you try your best, at least. I come from a line of police, so, you know, kinda a significant spot.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=shocked,Or are you more of a mercenary? I might have ethical issues with that.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=normal,Gotta say, big fan of <i>Heir of Grief</i>. Great music.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:1=happy,What's up your sleeve? I mean, if you were wearing any.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit=confident,I kind of agree with Pit. If you can't just fit it in the suit, maybe it's best not to bring it?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:pit=happy,Oh, I agree with Ochako! A utility belt would be cool if it, you know, it didn't totally cramp your style.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingStage:6-7=sad,Is that so, Marinette? <i>Well</i> I can help with that…

-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:2=confident,Is this all some sort of code name or secret identity exercise for you?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:samus=confident,Is this because of Justin Bailey? To show off you are in fact <i>quite</i> the woman?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=horny,Bwuh? Could you… Would you mind doing that thing with your tongue again? With the words?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=confident,Look, I'll level with you, Kyu. Big fan of HuniePop. Lessee whatcha got in this, though.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=confident,It’s a little rude to suggest you hang onto me, but I don’t mind giving you a street-level tour until we get our stuff back. I might need a shirt, though.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:2=sad,Hmm… Well, in light of that, gloves aren’t a <i>bad</i> choice for a second item.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1=confident,...You’re not gonna unload a can of whoop$#@? Phew.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:kim,targetStage:3=horny,That’s some great marketing or some crazy therapy sessions in the making.

#OPPONENT REMOVING MINOR CLOTHING
#Minor pieces of clothing don't reveal much when removed, but probably indicate more progress than accessory removal.

#fully clothed
0-male_removing_minor=confident,Aww yeah!
0-male_removing_minor=happy,Okay, not bad, not bad.
0-male_removing_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=shocked,I guess it makes sense that this universe would have a male Cap.
0-male_removing_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=angry,Camilla seems kinda like a $%#@!, if she’s making you do this kind of humiliating stuff, Corrin.
0-male_removing_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:2=excited,But those things look like you could kick a lot of #@$!
0-male_removing_minor,target:pit,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:captain_falcon=sad,Wanted to... <i>SHOW ME YA MOVES?</i> Uh, sorry, Captain Falcon... I was more interested in Pit's response...
0-male_removing_minor,target:pit,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:captain_falcon=confident,Wanted to... <i>SHOW ME YA MOVES?</i> I was serious earlier! Show me what you got!
0-male_removed_minor=excited,~name~, that's pretty good. But I'd rather you be pretty <i>and</i> good.
0-male_removed_minor=sad,Awww, I was hoping for something with… pizazz! Or pizza. Pizza’s good.
0-male_removed_minor,target:pit,targetStage:3=happy,Seriously. I can't wait to see one of my childhood heroes a little more <i>pankratiatic</i>... Does that make me a weirdo?
0-male_removed_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:3=normal,And I bet you have, Mr. Stars and Bars.
0-male_removed_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=happy,I just wasn’t expecting someone so...Hot. Or shy.
0-female_removing_minor=horny,Man, I knew ~name~ was cool! She's already taking off her ~clothing~!
0-female_removing_minor=angry,Surely, that’s not all you got, babe?
0-female_removing_minor,target:blake,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:blake_crush,marker:gwen_jealous=angry,Oh. She reminds you of someone, Marinette? That's cool, <i>I guess.</i>

0-female_removing_minor,target:ann,targetStage:0=normal,Your codename is... Panther... And you use a red latex costume?
0-female_removing_minor,target:asuna,targetStage:0,marker:asuna_cheerleader=sad,You seem like one. You're dressed that way, and you seem kinda... Like you need someone else to do the heavy lifting.
0-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=normal,I guess that's pretty cool. I think you and Reed Richards would get along, but he's more about machines and physics than psychology and computer science.
0-female_removing_minor,target:kim,targetStage:0=shocked,You seem like you’re fresh out of high school...
0-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=sad,I mean, like, damn, girl, I took off my mask. What're you-
0-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3=excited,Like. People who partner up. And that <i>would</i> fit well over my suit better than a hoodie…
0-female_removing_minor,target:raven,targetStage:0=angry,Girl, you serious?
0-female_removing_minor,target:shego,targetStage:0=confident,I’m gonna make the easiest joke in the world: the gloves are coming off, eh? Eh?

0-female_removed_minor=normal,Okay, okay, okay, next hand already!
0-female_removed_minor=excited,Good choice, ~name~. Big enough to start showing off the goods, small enough to keep it interesting.
0-female_removed_minor,target:shego,targetStage:1=normal,They can’t all be winners. Like, you and fashion sense.
0-female_removed_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:4=confident,Ha, where’d <i>this</i> confidence come from, Marinette?
0-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1=confident,You have some issues with showing your face, huh? I wonder why. It looks pretty to me, but I've got darkvision.
0-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=sad,Oh. Kyoko, I'm so sorry. Tell you what, why don't we go on a case together sometime? Like, in whatever capacity you'd like.
0-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika=confident,Well, everything. Good optimism, good techniques. Way to set the standard, Rainbow!
0-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=excited,Heh. To think, with the two of you working together, you can figure out why someone jumped, and he'd get to figure out when they hit the ground. Er. Too dark?
0-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=sad,My Spider-sense being on the fritz here doesn’t help when there’s a manic sharpshooter blowing off her clothes...
0-female_removed_minor,target:ann,targetStage:1=sad,Sorry, that all feels kinda derivative. I say. As <i>Spider-Woman</i>.
0-female_removed_minor,target:kim,targetStage:1=excited,Hold up, hold up. You’re a hero, with a website, and no secret identity? Say <i>what</i>?

#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible=sad,I gotta admit. I've thought about getting run through on something like that. But I think that's something best left to the imagination. I can't imagine webswinging, let alone walking, after a round with that.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:captain_america=horny,Holy crap, Steve. Like, unf. Let’s get it on, son.

-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:morrigan=confident,It’s only fair since we’re getting close to beating each other off… Okay, that’s more a term for dudes but I’m tryin’, alright?

#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.
