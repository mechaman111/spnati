#When selecting the characters to play the game, the first line will always play, then it randomly picks from any of the start lines after you commence the game but before you deal the first hand.


#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermione=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!

#POKER PLAY
#This is what a character says while they're exchanging cards and commenting on their hands afterwards.
#When swapping cards, the game will automatically put a display a number between 0-5 where you write ~cards~.
#These lines display on the screen for only a brief time, so it is important to make them short enough to read at a glance.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written
swap_cards,direction:down=joy,This’s much easier without all my armor. ~cards~.
swap_cards,direction:down=challenge,Just ~cards~.

okay_hand,direction:down=surprise,Now, wait a second. Red is supposed to be lucky. But this hand's hardly got anything good in it...
okay_hand,direction:down=joy,This'll do.
okay_hand,direction:down=chuckle,Oh, you're all in for it now!
okay_hand,direction:down=peace,Reflect before you act. This shall bring you glory and honor.
bad_hand,direction:down=dishonor,Honor’s <i>very</i> important. So, I’ll go ahead and admit this hand’s pretty much slop.
bad_hand,direction:down=denial,<i>Tsk.</i> And here I was, thinking myself so clever. I can fold, right? This hand, I mean. Obviously, any civilized person can do their own laundry...
bad_hand,direction:down=yikes,Well, at least I have nothing left to hide. Except my body. That I can hide.

0-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:kizuna,alsoPlayingStage:0,direction:down=pinged,Kind of rude to assume I'm just based entirely on some logic structure, Kizuna.
0-must_strip_losing,direction:down=dishonor,I’ve got delicate features. So what? Never watched any wuxia plays? Doesn’t mean I’m a girl. And even if I was, I’d want you to treat me the same.

0-stripping,direction:down=stripping,I’ve got a soft spot for wrists. Once, I used my big, throbbing man-brain to climb a pole with them. So, keeping a hard guard on my wrists just makes sense.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:catria,alsoPlayingStage:0-7,direction:down=stripping,Heh. You got me there, Catria. No Pegasi, but some yaoguai and dragons and ghosts.

0-stripping,alsoPlaying:larachel=stripping,I have a soft spot for wrists... they come in rather <i>handy</i>. A fetish...? No, but... I always learn a lot from someone's hands, L'Arachel.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0,direction:down=stripping,I'm impressed. Even with your one eyeglass, you can't tell the difference between a man and a woman, Meia.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:1-7,direction:down=stripping,Dealer, should we give Meia her eyeglass back? She seems to have a hard time telling the difference between a man and a woman.

#losing armor
1-stripped,direction:down=stripped,Was that phallic and manly enough for all of you, or do I need to get more overt with the fart and dick jokes?
1-stripped,direction:down=stripped,Was that sufficiently gross and manly? Come on, dealer, let’s show the rest of them not to mess with Fa Ping.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:catria,alsoPlayingStage:0-4,direction:down=stripped,And I'm <i>clearly</i> not girlishly built! Why! I'm not girly at all. I'm a big strong man. Obviously. right, Catria?
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jasmine,direction:down=stripped,Don't worry. We just remind each other of charming old friends. Eh. Heheh.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,direction:down=stripped,Then it becomes really important to stick it somewhere tight, warm, and wet. You'd do, Jura. You'd do well with men. Like, me.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:kamina,direction:down=stripped,Heh. I could do some jokes about farting or dicks. I've got a <i>big</i>, y'know. <i>Sense of humor.</i>

1-stripped,alsoPlaying:nayru,alsoPlayingStage:0-4,direction:down=stripped,<i>Especially</i> for a man, right, Nayru? Clearly my masculine charms must be winning you over.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:sheena,direction:down=stripped,...maybe you've gone blind from your bright outfit, but <i>I</i> don't plan on losing, Sheena.

1-stripping,alsoPlaying:revy,direction:down=stripping,I’ve fought bigger villains than you, and routed armies.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:syrenne=stripping,And to think, I fooled an entire army, only to be revealed by a drunken mercenary. Syrenne, you're wasting your potential.

2-stripped,direction:down=stripped,I’d quote Sun Tzu about knowing yourself and keeping your opponents off-guard, but that seems a little too...
2-stripped,direction:down=stripped,I’m not ashamed of being a woman, or anything. Sometimes it’s just good form to make a strong first impression. You'd best prepare yourselves.
2-stripped,direction:down=stripped,You’ve gotten me out of my armor. Now I’m going to get you out of the rest of… your stuff. All of it, so get ready!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:cammy,direction:down=stripped,I will, Cammy, just give me a moment. It's nice to stretch out a bit.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:catria,alsoPlayingStage:0-7,direction:down=stripped,<i>I</i> appreciate that it at least fooled Catria. Thanks for humoring me, my blue-haired Pegasus Knight.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:haru,direction:down=stripped,Well, Haru, I appreciate that. But I'm a little miffed the disguise wasn't better.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:ini,alsoPlayingStage:0-4,direction:down=stripped,I'm glad it fooled <i>Ini</i>. What an embarassment that could've been.

2-stripped,alsoPlaying:jotaro,direction:down=stripped,I did really like that you were so quick to defend my honor, Jotaro.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:kamina,direction:down=stripped,Am a woma-- Kamina. I'm a <i>woman.</i> One that's somehow flattered the disguise worked that well on you.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:larachel,direction:down=stripped,Well, I suppose it worked on some of you more than others. L'Arachel, <i>you</i> seem rather surprised. Shouldn't you be used to this sort of thing, being a crusader?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:misato,direction:down=stripped,Aww, you were so into it, Misato. You still <i>could</i> be.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:nayru,alsoPlayingStage:5-7,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:null_possess,direction:down=yikes,It really didn't surprise you, Veran?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,direction:down=stripped,Ah, no, Pit. You were very respectful. Don't change a thing. Except your clothes. Those have to go.

2-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=7,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:mulan_wuxia1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:mulan_wuxia1,direction:down=challenge,Why, yes! I would say I’m a Xia, but not quite a wanderer. I fight to protect my home, after all.
2-must_strip,alsoPlaying:syrenne=smirk,Is that so, Syrenne? I find the disguise less effective against one who's so... practiced in seeing other women xia in armor.
2-must_strip,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale,alsoPlayingStage:0-6,priority:10,direction:down=peace,Well... my wraps aren't as supportive as Ms. Trainer's bra, so they're at least a little more comfortable to get out of...

2-must_strip_winning,direction:down=interested,I’m no Captain Shang. I’m not going to be whipping you into shape, but I hope you realize that I’m winning, and that motivates you to assess yourselves.
2-must_strip_normal,direction:down=yikes,Dang! I thought I was doing so well! At least I have quite a few layers left. Perks of elaborate styles, I suppose.
2-must_strip_normal,direction:down=peace,I’ll hold onto the sword for a while longer. I’m fine with my hands, but I think you get my <i>point</i> better when I’m visibly armed.
2-must_strip_losing,direction:down=challenge,And here I was, worried you’d start taking it easy on me for being a woman. I appreciate the respect!

2-stripping,alsoPlaying:kamina,alsoPlayingStage:0,direction:down=stripping,I'll just kick these off. And yes, is that a shock, Kamina? I'm quite good at kicking!
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:kamina,alsoPlayingStage:1-9,direction:down=stripping,I'll kick these off. After all, Kamina did it earlier. Suitably manly, even dressed like this...

2-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mulan_fetish1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:mulan_fetish2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:mulan_fetish2,direction:down=stripping,It can be hard to take a female soldier seriously, in some regions, but the Inventory often struggles in recruiting men.

2-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mulan_mous1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:mulan_mous2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:mulan_mous2,direction:down=stripping,Well, apparently, the princesses hold most of the value in that group, but… we probably don’t need to get into that.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mulan_princess1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:mulan_princess2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:mulan_princess2,direction:down=stripping,Trust me, it’s confusing for me too, but I suppose nobility is in how one conducts themselves.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mulan_swords1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:mulan_swords2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:mulan_swords2,direction:down=stripping,I prefer mid-sized and smaller ones. I’m not really any good at doing tricks like using two together, and the big, two-handed ones lack some of the nimbleness I like.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mulan_taxes1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:mulan_taxes2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:mulan_taxes2,direction:down=stripping,But the Emperor and his magistrates tend to be fair.

2-stripping,alsoPlaying:syrenne,totalExposed:0=stripping,A duel's no fun if one's so far ahead, yeah?
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:syrenne,totalExposed:1=stripping,I seem to be fighting it a great deal better than our compatriots, Syrenne.

3-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mulan_mous2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:mulan_mous3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:mulan_mous3,direction:down=stripped,...Some of them can be pretty ruthless when they want to be. Let's definitely just keep the river running. Like a stream, right?
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mulan_princess2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:mulan_princess3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:mulan_princess3,direction:down=smirk,Some of the princesses I know are <i>definitely</i> into… well, why don’t you talk to Merida a few whiskeys in.

#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written
male_removing_accessory,direction:down=surprise,A diversionary tactic…? Huh, I figured you’d be a little more brave.
male_removing_accessory,direction:down=dishonor,I should slap-- I should punch you.
male_removed_accessory,direction:down=yikes,I’d taunt you about being beaten by a girl, but that seems a little demeaning to both of us.
male_removed_accessory,direction:down=denial,I don’t want to seem entitled… but I had expected my reveal to be met more with applause. I suppose women aren’t very interesting to you, ~name~?
male_removed_accessory,direction:down=dishonor,Hm. I suppose that's an acceptable play. Not thrilled it was your ~clothing~, if I'm honest.
male_removed_accessory,direction:down=chuckle,Something bigger next time, right?
female_removing_accessory,direction:down=interested,Acting like a proper lady, ~name~?
female_removing_accessory,direction:down=challenge,I’d have gone for something a bit bolder.
female_removing_accessory,direction:down=joy,Be yourself, ~name~. Whether that’s classy, or forward, or whatever terms you define yourself under.
female_removing_accessory,direction:down=surprise,~Clothing~? Hmm… a bit exotic for my taste… though I am somewhat of a, uh, tomboy…
female_removed_accessory,direction:down=denial,Picky, picky, picky…
female_removed_accessory,direction:down=dishonor,Are we in this together, or not, ~name~?
female_removed_accessory,direction:down=yikes,Being polite and demure might make one a good wife, but a rather frustrating opponents in cards.

0-male_removing_accessory,direction:down=surprise,Pfft. And here I was, expecting you to take off something decent.
0-male_removing_accessory,direction:down=dishonor,Playing the long-game, ~name~, or just being a coward?
0-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,I suppose royalty <i>are</i> kind of built like… uh, fine china.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,direction:down=dishonor,Must be nice to get a new set every generation.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:0,direction:down=dishonor,I'm no stranger to conflict, either, especially from nearby borders.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1,direction:down=surprise,...Very forward, if you mean what I think--
0-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:0,direction:down=surprise,Wha-- what was that? So fast!
0-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,Think you can take me in a fight? I know all kinds of competitions, uh, big guy.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:0,direction:down=challenge,Not bad. I'd follow up, but...
0-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,Basically, what I'm saying is, since you lost before me, that means <i>I'm</i> manlier.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,direction:down=joy,What's your home world like? Are all the soldiers like you?
0-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,A sash or a banner is a fine way of showing one's colors.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2,direction:down=joy,Who doesn't enjoy a bowl of hot soup, dumplings, and noodles? Especially with how cold this room is.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,I... see.
0-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=peace,I guess it’s still early.
0-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=challenge,Thought you’d be a bit more wild than that, ~name~. The whole <i>dignified</i> approach comes across as a bit cowardly. Not <i>judging</i> you, uh, man.
0-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=smirk,Really holding out on us, huh, tough guy?
0-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,direction:down=yikes,He’s even pale and kind of translucent!
0-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2,direction:down=yikes,I had to inherit mine, even though my father’s got a… slightly different build.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1,direction:down=surprise,I'm a little less... cavalier than you about it.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,--oh. Not the sword <i>I</i> had been expecting, but a lovely blade.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1,direction:down=dishonor,You know, I hadn't really considered that...
0-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,So you <i>can</i> stop time... I can think of a few uses for that.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,<i>I'm</i> not planning on losing.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,...though I'd be <i>impressed</i> if you proved otherwise. What'd'ya say?
0-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,You certainly seem capable. I'm looking forward to further displays of bravery, here.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,direction:down=joy,In my land, yellow is associated with rising spirits. I suppose with your wings, you're used to basking in the sunlight.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3,direction:down=chuckle,It's a challenge. Ryuji, if you win, I'll buy noodles. If you lose, you'll buy noodles. Either way, we don't have to leave this place on an empty stomach.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:4,direction:down=challenge,You're a little distracting, Ryuji. You remind me of an old captain. Have you ever been a captain?
0-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=interested,Makes sense your ~clothing~ would be frilly. Womanly stuff like that usually is, right?
0-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=joy,Your ~clothing~? Ha, how girly.
0-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=chuckle,I suppose you <i>could</i> just do small stuff. You know, not like a girl like you would <i>want</i> to lose in a game like this.
0-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=surprise,~name~’s trying to stay modest by only taking off her ~clothing~. That’s… uh, is it fair, or is it prudish? I’m not quite sure the right way to answer…
0-female_removing_accessory,target:larachel,targetStage:1,count-princess:1-2,id:2,direction:down=surprise,Oh! She's a princess! This all makes a lot more sense. I've always been excited to meet new princesses!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:0,direction:down=joy,I guess your people let women fight in the army too.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1,direction:down=joy,Just so you know, Aella, <i>Shan</i> means mountain.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:0,direction:down=yikes,Do you sing to animals, or…
0-female_removing_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Though, a word of advice, I'd hold onto my sword a bit longer...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,direction:down=denial,I know a thing or two about that.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,In uh, my experience, that’s a bit unusual.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0,direction:down=smirk,I didn't know they had an American Princess besides Tiana!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3,direction:down=joy,Slowing down the game a bit seems reasonable. No reason to rush to the climax, right?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Perhaps poisoned...? Cursed...? Kidnapped? Held at ransom? Made a deal with a witch...? Daddy issues?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:0,direction:down=yikes,Her outfit is... quite interesting. I guess her wrists will be cute...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1,direction:down=surprise,I promise, I'll stop the act, if we can get someone new in her place.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0,direction:down=challenge,Well, I suppose there’s <i>many</i> types of affection.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:0,direction:down=peace,Most witches I know tend to cause a lot of trouble for princesses...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mae,targetStage:0,direction:down=joy,Mae, is everyone from your world... do they all seem to be animals...?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,direction:down=surprise,I have uh, some Princess friends that are a bit more familiar with that sort of thing.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:0,direction:down=chuckle,So strange, to think that you’re an alchemist, and an acclaimed one at that!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,How you can stand to work in the cold everyday is a mystery to me, Mei.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,direction:down=smirk,Women from the Land of Dragons prefer flowing silks. Much easier to move in.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:1,direction:down=dishonor,It must be nice to have someone help you undress.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2,direction:down=dishonor,She's right, Crown Prince. It's dishonorable to exploit the rules.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3,direction:down=denial,<i>Headphones?</i> Now you're pulling my leg, Crown Prince Miko.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Your dress is so short, though… are you preparing for war, Nagisa?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0,direction:down=peace,When you return to your realm, if you would kindly pass on a good word to my ancestors, this entire game will have been worth it.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,I uh, want to know how to remove it from other women like you. <i>Clearly.</i>
0-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0,direction:down=denial,Wait, how'd you do that? Sorcery!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0,direction:down=denial,A pirate, a smuggler, and a murderer for hire.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3,direction:down=surprise,Though… it isn’t like I haven’t had to be flexible with the concept of honor in my life…
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,direction:down=smirk,Are you a Hun? I’ve fought and triumphed over many barbarians just like you.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Ah, so sorry. I keep forgetting that I’m not in the Land of Dragons anymore.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0,direction:down=joy,You have a warrior's presence to you, Sayaka.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:0,direction:down=joy,And a pilot…
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1,direction:down=peace,Those look quite soft and silent. You... are a warrior, aren't you?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:syrenne,targetStage:1,direction:down=joy,Though, if you were a <i>boy</i> this'd be quite the chance to tell you you were <i>strapping.</i>.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:0,direction:down=smirk,You certainly don't dress like a mortal...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Are scarves popular in your deific realm, Zizou?
0-female_removed_accessory,marker:suspicious_denial,direction:down=denial,Not surprised you stuck with something small. Women are loaded up with tons of that kind of things. ~Clothing~. Cute and delicate ~clothing~.
0-female_removed_accessory,direction:down=denial,So, let’s see what’s next, right? ~clothing~? Seriously. Who wears ~Clothing~ when you could show up in a full set of armor?
0-female_removed_accessory,direction:down=smirk,I guess a <i>fair</i> and chivalrous maiden like ~name~ would part with her ~clothing~ rather than expose herself to a rowdy crowd like this. <i>Heh!</i>
0-female_removed_accessory,direction:down=denial,I was just checking out her ~clothing~... Uh, checking ~name~ out. Like a guys-guy would do.
0-female_removed_accessory,marker:suspicious_denial,direction:down=denial,If I were a woman, I’d try something like that. If I were. Which I’m not.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,That’s something, I guess. <i>Though I can’t ever imagine that being something we’d need in my Kingdom.</i>
0-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1,direction:down=surprise,Just have to make sure to keep the men and women separate, right? Would be a real shame if that got mixed up.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2,direction:down=surprise,Because, uh, you’re big and strong. And everyone probably wants to climb on top. Eheh. Quite the jokester, I am, and not the first time you’ve heard it, I’m sure.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,I get it! You must talk to plants! That’s quite the talent.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,I see! Did you come to look at <i>spears</i> tonight, Catria?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1,direction:down=joy,Love the hairstyle and qipao, Chun-Li. I feel like we’re gonna be good friends.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,And to let you wear such a feminine outfit… That Overwatch place is doing something right.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1,direction:down=denial,Huh? You aren't a princess? You could've fooled me!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1,totalMales:0,direction:down=denial,I-I'm not familiar with princesses at all! That's why I asked. I guess a princess wouldn't just lift her skirt like that, though...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:4,direction:down=smirk,I guess every princess should have <i>some</i>thing that's iconic and special.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:4,totalFemales:5,direction:down=challenge,I don't know about that, Elizabeth. I certainly understand!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,<i>There</i> we go! I know a princess when I see one! Do you get the whole "singing about a dream," accompaniment, too? O-Oh. Y-you just have such a regal bearing...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,You should learn to use your bracelets to propel you to new heights, Ini. I did that once.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:2,direction:down=dishonor,<i>Sigh.</i> At least she's reasonably cute.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1,direction:down=joy,Let’s just say I’m sure both of us are familiar with various varieties and split the difference, hm, Kyu?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:larachel,targetStage:2,direction:down=joy,Okay, a <i>magical, holy princess.</i> Do you have some sort of friendly animal companion? A great singing voice? I've heard those things are pretty much standard.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1,direction:down=surprise,How do I know that? Well, uh, obviously, as a xia, I'm duty-bound to protect princesses.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:2,direction:down=joy,It looks lovely! If you want to talk about bad hair days, you should meet Rapunzel. I think she's from a world near yours...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mae,targetStage:1,direction:down=yikes,Oh-- am I...? Not seeing clearly? Pardon, this <i>is</i> a very exotic place. I could've sworn I saw you with cat ears.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,direction:down=yikes,If we could <i>not</i> ruin some surprises, Mahiru, I’d be quite grateful.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1,direction:down=joy,Thank you for continuing to do our people proud, Mei.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:2,direction:down=smirk,Perhaps I <i>should</i> talk to you about modernizing my armor… against the cold, if nothing else.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,Unlike myself, of course. I prefer my manly, heavy armor.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,I hope you didn't plan to win by <i>deceiving</i> us, Crown Prince.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3,direction:down=surprise,Uh. Nevermind me. I'll just... be here. Eating my words.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4,direction:down=smirk,If I knew we could've come in our modern apparel, I could've forgone the bulky armor...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,Such a young girl, and so convicted. I imagine that your friends and ancestors are proud of you. Do they allow women in the army, from where you’re from?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Thank you, Lady Palutena, you honor me.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=surprise,Hm. I thought this would be a friendly game of cards...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1,direction:down=dishonor,I may keep secrets, but I don’t bring shame upon my ancestors with every action!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4,direction:down=dishonor,I don't think I take it your extreme, nor would I ever.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=denial,Though, it is much nicer to do so in cards or words rather than with swords or explosions or avalanches.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,You do have dragons where you’re from… right?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,I'm glad you're something of a witch-hunter. Many princesses struggle with witches, you know.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,I’m impressed. Especially as a man, for a woman to do that kind of a job. Definitely really impressive. Really, really impressive.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,You're quite skilled at cards, Sheena! How are you doing those tricks...?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:2,direction:down=yikes,I just thought it odd that your clothing is so bright, but it seems designed to be stealthy.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:syrenne,targetStage:2,totalExposed:0-1,direction:down=chuckle,A bold declaration, considering how your competition's faring.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:syrenne,targetStage:2,totalExposed:2-5,direction:down=surprise,You're... doing surprisingly well, I'll admit.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,You're a little irreverent, Zizou. I suppose you don't require much... deference... from mortals.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:2,direction:down=joy,I see. I was wondering if... nevermind.

1-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:4,direction:down=challenge,You're a little distracting, Ryuji. You remind me of an old captain. Have you ever been a captain?
1-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=interested,Makes sense your ~clothing~ would be frilly. Womanly stuff like that usually is, right?
1-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=joy,Your ~clothing~? Ha, how girly.
1-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=chuckle,I suppose you <i>could</i> just do small stuff. You know, not like a girl like you would <i>want</i> to lose in a game like this.
1-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=surprise,~name~’s trying to stay modest by only taking off her ~clothing~. That’s… uh, is it fair, or is it prudish? I’m not quite sure the right way to answer…
1-female_removing_accessory,target:larachel,targetStage:1,count-princess:1-2,id:2,direction:down=surprise,Oh! She's a princess! This all makes a lot more sense. I've always been excited to meet new princesses!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:0,direction:down=joy,I guess your people let women fight in the army too.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1,direction:down=joy,Just so you know, Aella, <i>Shan</i> means mountain.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:0,direction:down=yikes,Do you sing to animals, or…
1-female_removing_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Though, a word of advice, I'd hold onto my sword a bit longer...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,direction:down=denial,I know a thing or two about that.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,In uh, my experience, that’s a bit unusual.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0,direction:down=smirk,I didn't know they had an American Princess besides Tiana!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3,direction:down=joy,Slowing down the game a bit seems reasonable. No reason to rush to the climax, right?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Perhaps poisoned...? Cursed...? Kidnapped? Held at ransom? Made a deal with a witch...? Daddy issues?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:0,direction:down=yikes,Her outfit is... quite interesting. I guess her wrists will be cute...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1,direction:down=surprise,I promise, I'll stop the act, if we can get someone new in her place.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0,direction:down=challenge,Well, I suppose there’s <i>many</i> types of affection.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:0,direction:down=peace,Most witches I know tend to cause a lot of trouble for princesses...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mae,targetStage:0,direction:down=joy,Mae, is everyone from your world... do they all seem to be animals...?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,direction:down=surprise,I have uh, some Princess friends that are a bit more familiar with that sort of thing.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:0,direction:down=chuckle,So strange, to think that you’re an alchemist, and an acclaimed one at that!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,How you can stand to work in the cold everyday is a mystery to me, Mei.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,direction:down=smirk,Women from the Land of Dragons prefer flowing silks. Much easier to move in.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:1,direction:down=dishonor,It must be nice to have someone help you undress.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2,direction:down=dishonor,She's right, Crown Prince. It's dishonorable to exploit the rules.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3,direction:down=denial,<i>Headphones?</i> Now you're pulling my leg, Crown Prince Miko.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Your dress is so short, though… are you preparing for war, Nagisa?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0,direction:down=peace,When you return to your realm, if you would kindly pass on a good word to my ancestors, this entire game will have been worth it.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,I uh, want to know how to remove it from other women like you. <i>Clearly.</i>
1-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0,direction:down=denial,Wait, how'd you do that? Sorcery!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0,direction:down=denial,A pirate, a smuggler, and a murderer for hire.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3,direction:down=surprise,Though… it isn’t like I haven’t had to be flexible with the concept of honor in my life…
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,direction:down=smirk,Are you a Hun? I’ve fought and triumphed over many barbarians just like you.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Ah, so sorry. I keep forgetting that I’m not in the Land of Dragons anymore.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0,direction:down=joy,You have a warrior's presence to you, Sayaka.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:0,direction:down=joy,And a pilot…
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1,direction:down=peace,Those look quite soft and silent. You... are a warrior, aren't you?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:syrenne,targetStage:1,direction:down=joy,Though, if you were a <i>boy</i> this'd be quite the chance to tell you you were <i>strapping.</i>.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:0,direction:down=smirk,You certainly don't dress like a mortal...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Are scarves popular in your deific realm, Zizou?
1-female_removed_accessory,marker:suspicious_denial,direction:down=denial,Not surprised you stuck with something small. Women are loaded up with tons of that kind of things. ~Clothing~. Cute and delicate ~clothing~.
1-female_removed_accessory,direction:down=denial,So, let’s see what’s next, right? ~clothing~? Seriously. Who wears ~Clothing~ when you could show up in a full set of armor?
1-female_removed_accessory,direction:down=smirk,I guess a <i>fair</i> and chivalrous maiden like ~name~ would part with her ~clothing~ rather than expose herself to a rowdy crowd like this. <i>Heh!</i>
1-female_removed_accessory,direction:down=denial,I was just checking out her ~clothing~... Uh, checking ~name~ out. Like a guys-guy would do.
1-female_removed_accessory,marker:suspicious_denial,direction:down=denial,If I were a woman, I’d try something like that. If I were. Which I’m not.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,That’s something, I guess. <i>Though I can’t ever imagine that being something we’d need in my Kingdom.</i>
1-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1,direction:down=surprise,Just have to make sure to keep the men and women separate, right? Would be a real shame if that got mixed up.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2,direction:down=surprise,Because, uh, you’re big and strong. And everyone probably wants to climb on top. Eheh. Quite the jokester, I am, and not the first time you’ve heard it, I’m sure.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,I get it! You must talk to plants! That’s quite the talent.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,I see! Did you come to look at <i>spears</i> tonight, Catria?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1,direction:down=joy,Love the hairstyle and qipao, Chun-Li. I feel like we’re gonna be good friends.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,And to let you wear such a feminine outfit… That Overwatch place is doing something right.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1,direction:down=denial,Huh? You aren't a princess? You could've fooled me!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1,totalMales:0,direction:down=denial,I-I'm not familiar with princesses at all! That's why I asked. I guess a princess wouldn't just lift her skirt like that, though...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:4,direction:down=smirk,I guess every princess should have <i>some</i>thing that's iconic and special.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:4,totalFemales:5,direction:down=challenge,I don't know about that, Elizabeth. I certainly understand!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,<i>There</i> we go! I know a princess when I see one! Do you get the whole "singing about a dream," accompaniment, too? O-Oh. Y-you just have such a regal bearing...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,You should learn to use your bracelets to propel you to new heights, Ini. I did that once.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:2,direction:down=dishonor,<i>Sigh.</i> At least she's reasonably cute.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1,direction:down=joy,Let’s just say I’m sure both of us are familiar with various varieties and split the difference, hm, Kyu?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:larachel,targetStage:2,direction:down=joy,Okay, a <i>magical, holy princess.</i> Do you have some sort of friendly animal companion? A great singing voice? I've heard those things are pretty much standard.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1,direction:down=surprise,How do I know that? Well, uh, obviously, as a xia, I'm duty-bound to protect princesses.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:2,direction:down=joy,It looks lovely! If you want to talk about bad hair days, you should meet Rapunzel. I think she's from a world near yours...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mae,targetStage:1,direction:down=yikes,Oh-- am I...? Not seeing clearly? Pardon, this <i>is</i> a very exotic place. I could've sworn I saw you with cat ears.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,direction:down=yikes,If we could <i>not</i> ruin some surprises, Mahiru, I’d be quite grateful.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1,direction:down=joy,Thank you for continuing to do our people proud, Mei.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:2,direction:down=smirk,Perhaps I <i>should</i> talk to you about modernizing my armor… against the cold, if nothing else.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,Unlike myself, of course. I prefer my manly, heavy armor.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,I hope you didn't plan to win by <i>deceiving</i> us, Crown Prince.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3,direction:down=surprise,Uh. Nevermind me. I'll just... be here. Eating my words.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4,direction:down=smirk,If I knew we could've come in our modern apparel, I could've forgone the bulky armor...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,Such a young girl, and so convicted. I imagine that your friends and ancestors are proud of you. Do they allow women in the army, from where you’re from?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Thank you, Lady Palutena, you honor me.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=surprise,Hm. I thought this would be a friendly game of cards...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1,direction:down=dishonor,I may keep secrets, but I don’t bring shame upon my ancestors with every action!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4,direction:down=dishonor,I don't think I take it your extreme, nor would I ever.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=denial,Though, it is much nicer to do so in cards or words rather than with swords or explosions or avalanches.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,You do have dragons where you’re from… right?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,I'm glad you're something of a witch-hunter. Many princesses struggle with witches, you know.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,I’m impressed. Especially as a man, for a woman to do that kind of a job. Definitely really impressive. Really, really impressive.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,You're quite skilled at cards, Sheena! How are you doing those tricks...?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:2,direction:down=yikes,I just thought it odd that your clothing is so bright, but it seems designed to be stealthy.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:syrenne,targetStage:2,totalExposed:0-1,direction:down=chuckle,A bold declaration, considering how your competition's faring.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:syrenne,targetStage:2,totalExposed:2-5,direction:down=surprise,You're... doing surprisingly well, I'll admit.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,You're a little irreverent, Zizou. I suppose you don't require much... deference... from mortals.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:2,direction:down=joy,I see. I was wondering if... nevermind.


#lost armor
2-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,I suppose royalty <i>are</i> kind of built like… uh, fine china.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,direction:down=dishonor,Must be nice to get a new set every generation.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:0,direction:down=dishonor,I'm no stranger to conflict, either, especially from nearby borders.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1,direction:down=surprise,...Very forward, if you mean what I think--
2-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:0,direction:down=surprise,Wha-- what was that? So fast!
2-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,Think you can take me in a fight? I know all kinds of competitions, uh, big guy.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:0,direction:down=chuckle,You <i>do</i> seem like the kind of man to rise to an occasion, after all.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,I certainly hope you didn't plan on holding back <i>now</i>.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:proud,direction:down=surprise,How about what now?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,direction:down=joy,What's your home world like? Are all the soldiers like you?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,A sash or a banner is a fine way of showing one's colors.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2,direction:down=joy,Who doesn't enjoy a bowl of hot soup, dumplings, and noodles? Especially with how cold this room is.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,I... see.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,direction:down=yikes,He’s even pale and kind of translucent!
2-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2,direction:down=yikes,I had to inherit mine, even though my father’s got a… slightly different build.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1,direction:down=surprise,I'm a little less... cavalier than you about it.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,--oh. Not the sword <i>I</i> had been expecting, but a lovely blade.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1,direction:down=dishonor,You know, I hadn't really considered that...
2-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,So you <i>can</i> stop time... I can think of a few uses for that.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=surprise,Well, if that's true, Kamina, I suppose I gave it away earlier.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:3,direction:down=challenge,Man <i>or</i> woman, it's a virtue to fight someone so... persistent!
2-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:proud,direction:down=challenge,Do I need to tell you again not to underestimate me, Kamina? I don't mind proving it, either.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,You certainly seem capable. I'm looking forward to further displays of bravery, here.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,direction:down=joy,In my land, yellow is associated with rising spirits. I suppose with your wings, you're used to basking in the sunlight.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3,direction:down=chuckle,It's a challenge. Ryuji, if you win, I'll buy noodles. If you lose, you'll buy noodles. Either way, we don't have to leave this place on an empty stomach.

2-female_removing_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:0,direction:down=yikes,Do you sing to animals, or…
2-female_removing_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Though, a word of advice, I'd hold onto my sword a bit longer...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,direction:down=denial,I know a thing or two about that.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,In uh, my experience, that’s a bit unusual.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0,direction:down=smirk,I didn't know they had an American Princess besides Tiana!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3,direction:down=joy,Slowing down the game a bit seems reasonable. No reason to rush to the climax, right?

2-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1,direction:down=yikes,Did... is this why she fell for my disguise? <i>Oh no.</i>
2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0,direction:down=challenge,Well, I suppose there’s <i>many</i> types of affection.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:0,direction:down=peace,Most witches I know tend to cause a lot of trouble for princesses...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mae,targetStage:0,direction:down=joy,Mae, is everyone from your world... do they all seem to be animals...?

2-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:0,direction:down=chuckle,So strange, to think that you’re an alchemist, and an acclaimed one at that!

2-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,direction:down=smirk,Women from the Land of Dragons prefer flowing silks. Much easier to move in.

2-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0,direction:down=peace,When you return to your realm, if you would kindly pass on a good word to my ancestors, this entire game will have been worth it.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1,direction:down=smirk,I do like my sash, but that looks fairly... magical.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0,direction:down=denial,Wait, how'd you do that? Sorcery!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0,direction:down=denial,A pirate, a smuggler, and a murderer for hire.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3,direction:down=surprise,Though… it isn’t like I haven’t had to be flexible with the concept of honor in my life…

2-female_removed_accessory,notSaidMarker:roster_admit,marker:roster_admit,direction:down=chuckle,It’s actually quite a challenge to get on the roster as a woman. I suppose I appreciate you not going easy on me.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,I get it! You must talk to plants! That’s quite the talent.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,I see! Did you come to look at <i>spears</i> tonight, Catria?

2-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Thank you, Lady Palutena, you honor me.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=surprise,Hm. I thought this would be a friendly game of cards...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1,direction:down=dishonor,I may keep secrets, but I don’t bring shame upon my ancestors with every action!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4,direction:down=dishonor,I don't think I take it your extreme, nor would I ever.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=denial,Though, it is much nicer to do so in cards or words rather than with swords or explosions or avalanches.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,You do have dragons where you’re from… right?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,I'm glad you're something of a witch-hunter. Many princesses struggle with witches, you know.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,I’m impressed! By a woman doing that kind of a job. Definitely really impressive. Really, really impressive.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,You're quite skilled at cards, Sheena! How are you doing those tricks...?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:2,direction:down=yikes,I just thought it odd that your clothing is so bright, but it seems designed to be stealthy.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:syrenne,targetStage:2,totalExposed:0-1,direction:down=chuckle,A bold declaration, considering how your competition's faring.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:syrenne,targetStage:2,totalExposed:2-5,direction:down=surprise,You're... doing surprisingly well, I'll admit.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,You're a little irreverent, Zizou. I suppose you don't require much... deference... from mortals.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:2,direction:down=joy,I see. I was wondering if... nevermind.


#lost shoes
3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,I suppose royalty <i>are</i> kind of built like… uh, fine china.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,direction:down=dishonor,Must be nice to get a new set every generation.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:0,direction:down=dishonor,I'm no stranger to conflict, either, especially from nearby borders.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1,direction:down=surprise,...Very forward, if you mean what I think--
3-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:0,direction:down=surprise,Wha-- what was that? So fast!
3-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,Think you can take me in a fight? I know all kinds of competitions, uh, big guy.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:0,direction:down=chuckle,You <i>do</i> seem like the kind of man to rise to an occasion, after all.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,I certainly hope you didn't plan on holding back <i>now</i>.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:proud,direction:down=surprise,How about what now?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,direction:down=joy,What's your home world like? Are all the soldiers like you?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,A sash or a banner is a fine way of showing one's colors.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2,direction:down=joy,Who doesn't enjoy a bowl of hot soup, dumplings, and noodles? Especially with how cold this room is.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,I... see.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,direction:down=yikes,He’s even pale and kind of translucent!
3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2,direction:down=yikes,I had to inherit mine, even though my father’s got a… slightly different build.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1,direction:down=surprise,I'm a little less... cavalier than you about it.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,--oh. Not the sword <i>I</i> had been expecting, but a lovely blade.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1,direction:down=dishonor,You know, I hadn't really considered that...
3-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,So you <i>can</i> stop time... I can think of a few uses for that.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=surprise,Well, if that's true, Kamina, I suppose I gave it away earlier.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:3,direction:down=challenge,Man <i>or</i> woman, it's a virtue to fight someone so... persistent!
3-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:proud,direction:down=challenge,Do I need to tell you again not to underestimate me, Kamina? I don't mind proving it, either.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,You certainly seem capable. I'm looking forward to further displays of bravery, here.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,direction:down=joy,In my land, yellow is associated with rising spirits. I suppose with your wings, you're used to basking in the sunlight.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3,direction:down=chuckle,It's a challenge. Ryuji, if you win, I'll buy noodles. If you lose, you'll buy noodles. Either way, we don't have to leave this place on an empty stomach.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:4,direction:down=challenge,You're a little distracting, Ryuji. You remind me of an old captain. Have you ever been a captain?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:larachel,targetStage:1,count-princess:1-2,id:2,direction:down=surprise,Oh! She's a princess! This all makes a lot more sense. I've always been excited to meet new princesses!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:0,direction:down=yikes,Do you sing to animals, or…
3-female_removing_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Though, a word of advice, I'd hold onto my sword a bit longer...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,direction:down=denial,I know a thing or two about that.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,In uh, my experience, that’s a bit unusual.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0,direction:down=smirk,I didn't know they had an American Princess besides Tiana!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3,direction:down=joy,Slowing down the game a bit seems reasonable. No reason to rush to the climax, right?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Perhaps poisoned...? Cursed...? Kidnapped? Held at ransom? Made a deal with a witch...? Daddy issues?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:0,direction:down=yikes,Her outfit is... quite interesting. I guess her wrists will be cute...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1,direction:down=yikes,Did... is this why she fell for my disguise? <i>Oh no.</i>
3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0,direction:down=challenge,Well, I suppose there’s <i>many</i> types of affection.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:0,direction:down=peace,Most witches I know tend to cause a lot of trouble for princesses...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mae,targetStage:0,direction:down=joy,Mae, is everyone from your world... do they all seem to be animals...?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,direction:down=surprise,I have uh, some Princess friends that are a bit more familiar with that sort of thing.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:0,direction:down=chuckle,So strange, to think that you’re an alchemist, and an acclaimed one at that!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,How you can stand to work in the cold everyday is a mystery to me, Mei.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,direction:down=smirk,Women from the Land of Dragons prefer flowing silks. Much easier to move in.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:1,direction:down=dishonor,It must be nice to have someone help you undress.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2,direction:down=dishonor,She's right, Crown Prince. It's dishonorable to exploit the rules.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3,direction:down=denial,<i>Headphones?</i> Now you're pulling my leg, Crown Prince Miko.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Your dress is so short, though… are you preparing for war, Nagisa?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0,direction:down=peace,When you return to your realm, if you would kindly pass on a good word to my ancestors, this entire game will have been worth it.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1,direction:down=smirk,I do like my sash, but that looks fairly... magical.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0,direction:down=denial,Wait, how'd you do that? Sorcery!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0,direction:down=denial,A pirate, a smuggler, and a murderer for hire.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3,direction:down=surprise,Though… it isn’t like I haven’t had to be flexible with the concept of honor in my life…
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,direction:down=smirk,Are you a Hun? I’ve fought and triumphed over many barbarians just like you.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Ah, so sorry. I keep forgetting that I’m not in the Land of Dragons anymore.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0,direction:down=joy,You have a warrior's presence to you, Sayaka.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:0,direction:down=joy,And a pilot…
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1,direction:down=peace,Those look quite soft and silent. You... are a warrior, aren't you?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:syrenne,targetStage:1,direction:down=joy,Though, if you were a <i>boy</i> this'd be quite the chance to tell you you were <i>strapping.</i>.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:0,direction:down=smirk,You certainly don't dress like a mortal...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Are scarves popular in your deific realm, Zizou?
3-female_removed_accessory,notSaidMarker:roster_admit,marker:roster_admit,direction:down=chuckle,It’s actually quite a challenge to get on the roster as a woman. I suppose I appreciate you not going easy on me.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,I get it! You must talk to plants! That’s quite the talent.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,I see! Did you come to look at <i>spears</i> tonight, Catria?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1,direction:down=joy,Love the hairstyle and qipao, Chun-Li. I feel like we’re gonna be good friends.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,And to let you wear such a feminine outfit… That Overwatch place is doing something right.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1,direction:down=denial,Huh? You aren't a princess? You could've fooled me!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1,totalMales:0,direction:down=denial,I-I'm not familiar with princesses at all! That's why I asked. I guess a princess wouldn't just lift her skirt like that, though...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:4,direction:down=smirk,I guess every princess should have <i>some</i>thing that's iconic and special.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,<i>There</i> we go! I know a princess when I see one! Do you get the whole "singing about a dream," accompaniment, too? O-Oh. Y-you just have such a regal bearing...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,You should learn to use your bracelets to propel you to new heights, Ini. I did that once.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:2,direction:down=dishonor,<i>Sigh.</i> At least she's reasonably cute.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1,direction:down=joy,Let’s just say I’m sure both of us are familiar with various varieties and split the difference, hm, Kyu?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:larachel,targetStage:2,direction:down=joy,Okay, a <i>magical, holy princess.</i> Do you have some sort of friendly animal companion? A great singing voice? I've heard those things are pretty much standard.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,I know quite a few princesses. You seem to act more like them than the witches I usually hear about. A witch princess, even.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:2,direction:down=joy,It looks lovely! If you want to talk about bad hair days, you should meet Rapunzel. I think she's from a world near yours...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mae,targetStage:1,direction:down=yikes,Oh-- am I...? Not seeing clearly? Pardon, this <i>is</i> a very exotic place. I could've sworn I saw you with cat ears.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,direction:down=yikes,If we could <i>not</i> ruin some surprises, Mahiru, I’d be quite grateful.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1,direction:down=joy,Thank you for continuing to do our people proud, Mei.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:2,direction:down=smirk,Perhaps I <i>should</i> talk to you about modernizing my armor… against the cold, if nothing else.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,As you can tell by my attire, I like to remain mobile. That looks... <i>very</i> tight.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,I hope you didn't plan to win by <i>deceiving</i> us, Crown Prince.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3,direction:down=surprise,Uh. Nevermind me. I'll just... be here. Eating my words.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4,direction:down=smirk,If I knew we could've come in our modern apparel, I could've forgone the bulky armor...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,Such a young girl, and so convicted. I imagine that your friends and ancestors are proud of you. Do they allow women in the army, from where you’re from?

4-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1,direction:down=joy,Love the hairstyle and qipao, Chun-Li. I feel like we’re gonna be good friends.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,And to let you wear such a feminine outfit… That Overwatch place is doing something right.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1,direction:down=denial,Huh? You aren't a princess? You could've fooled me!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1,totalMales:0,direction:down=denial,I-I'm not familiar with princesses at all! That's why I asked. I guess a princess wouldn't just lift her skirt like that, though...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:4,direction:down=smirk,I guess every princess should have <i>some</i>thing that's iconic and special.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,<i>There</i> we go! I know a princess when I see one! Do you get the whole "singing about a dream," accompaniment, too? O-Oh. Y-you just have such a regal bearing...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,You should learn to use your bracelets to propel you to new heights, Ini. I did that once.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:2,direction:down=dishonor,<i>Sigh.</i> At least she's reasonably cute.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1,direction:down=joy,Let’s just say I’m sure both of us are familiar with various varieties and split the difference, hm, Kyu?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:larachel,targetStage:2,direction:down=joy,Okay, a <i>magical, holy princess.</i> Do you have some sort of friendly animal companion? A great singing voice? I've heard those things are pretty much standard.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,I know quite a few princesses. You seem to act more like them than the witches I usually hear about. A witch princess, even.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:2,direction:down=joy,It looks lovely! If you want to talk about bad hair days, you should meet Rapunzel. I think she's from a world near yours...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mae,targetStage:1,direction:down=yikes,Oh-- am I...? Not seeing clearly? Pardon, this <i>is</i> a very exotic place. I could've sworn I saw you with cat ears.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,direction:down=yikes,If we could <i>not</i> ruin some surprises, Mahiru, I’d be quite grateful.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1,direction:down=joy,Thank you for continuing to do our people proud, Mei.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:2,direction:down=smirk,Perhaps I <i>should</i> talk to you about modernizing my armor… against the cold, if nothing else.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,As you can tell by my attire, I like to remain mobile. That looks... <i>very</i> tight.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,I hope you didn't plan to win by <i>deceiving</i> us, Crown Prince.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3,direction:down=surprise,Uh. Nevermind me. I'll just... be here. Eating my words.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4,direction:down=smirk,If I knew we could've come in our modern apparel, I could've forgone the bulky armor...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,Such a young girl, and so convicted. I imagine that your friends and ancestors are proud of you. Do they allow women in the army, from where you’re from?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Thank you, Lady Palutena, you honor me.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=surprise,Hm. I thought this would be a friendly game of cards...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1,direction:down=dishonor,I may keep secrets, but I don’t bring shame upon my ancestors with every action!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4,direction:down=dishonor,I don't think I take it your extreme, nor would I ever.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=denial,Though, it is much nicer to do so in cards or words rather than with swords or explosions or avalanches.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,You do have dragons where you’re from… right?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,I'm glad you're something of a witch-hunter. Many princesses struggle with witches, you know.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,I’m impressed! By a woman doing that kind of a job. Definitely really impressive. Really, really impressive.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,You're quite skilled at cards, Sheena! How are you doing those tricks...?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:2,direction:down=yikes,I just thought it odd that your clothing is so bright, but it seems designed to be stealthy.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:syrenne,targetStage:2,totalExposed:0-1,direction:down=chuckle,A bold declaration, considering how your competition's faring.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:syrenne,targetStage:2,totalExposed:2-5,direction:down=surprise,You're... doing surprisingly well, I'll admit.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,You're a little irreverent, Zizou. I suppose you don't require much... deference... from mortals.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:2,direction:down=joy,I see. I was wondering if... nevermind.

5-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,I suppose royalty <i>are</i> kind of built like… uh, fine china.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,direction:down=dishonor,Must be nice to get a new set every generation.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:0,direction:down=dishonor,I'm no stranger to conflict, either, especially from nearby borders.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1,direction:down=surprise,...Very forward, if you mean what I think--
5-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:0,direction:down=surprise,Wha-- what was that? So fast!
5-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,Think you can take me in a fight? I know all kinds of competitions, uh, big guy.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:0,direction:down=chuckle,You <i>do</i> seem like the kind of man to rise to an occasion, after all.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,I certainly hope you didn't plan on holding back <i>now</i>.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:proud,direction:down=surprise,How about what now?
5-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,direction:down=joy,What's your home world like? Are all the soldiers like you?
5-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,A sash or a banner is a fine way of showing one's colors.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2,direction:down=joy,Who doesn't enjoy a bowl of hot soup, dumplings, and noodles? Especially with how cold this room is.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,I... see.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,direction:down=yikes,He’s even pale and kind of translucent!
5-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2,direction:down=yikes,I had to inherit mine, even though my father’s got a… slightly different build.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1,direction:down=surprise,I'm a little less... cavalier than you about it.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,--oh. Not the sword <i>I</i> had been expecting, but a lovely blade.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1,direction:down=dishonor,You know, I hadn't really considered that...
5-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,So you <i>can</i> stop time... I can think of a few uses for that.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=surprise,Well, if that's true, Kamina, I suppose I gave it away earlier.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:3,direction:down=challenge,Man <i>or</i> woman, it's a virtue to fight someone so... persistent!
5-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:proud,direction:down=challenge,Do I need to tell you again not to underestimate me, Kamina? I don't mind proving it, either.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,You certainly seem capable. I'm looking forward to further displays of bravery, here.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,direction:down=joy,In my land, yellow is associated with rising spirits. I suppose with your wings, you're used to basking in the sunlight.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3,direction:down=chuckle,It's a challenge. Ryuji, if you win, I'll buy noodles. If you lose, you'll buy noodles. Either way, we don't have to leave this place on an empty stomach.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:4,direction:down=challenge,You're a little distracting, Ryuji. You remind me of an old captain. Have you ever been a captain?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:larachel,targetStage:1,count-princess:1-2,id:2,direction:down=surprise,Oh! She's a princess! This all makes a lot more sense. I've always been excited to meet new princesses!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:0,direction:down=yikes,Do you sing to animals, or…
5-female_removing_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:0,direction:down=yikes,Maybe taking off your weapon first is good form for a game like this... I hope keeping mine as long as I did wasn't rude.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,direction:down=denial,I know a thing or two about that.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,In uh, my experience, that’s a bit unusual.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0,direction:down=smirk,I didn't know they had an American Princess besides Tiana!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3,direction:down=joy,Slowing down the game a bit seems reasonable. No reason to rush to the climax, right?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Perhaps poisoned...? Cursed...? Kidnapped? Held at ransom? Made a deal with a witch...? Daddy issues?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:0,direction:down=yikes,Her outfit is... quite interesting. I guess her wrists will be cute...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1,direction:down=yikes,Did... is this why she fell for my disguise? <i>Oh no.</i>
5-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0,direction:down=challenge,Well, I suppose there’s <i>many</i> types of affection.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:0,direction:down=peace,Most witches I know tend to cause a lot of trouble for princesses...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mae,targetStage:0,direction:down=joy,Mae, is everyone from your world... do they all seem to be animals...?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,direction:down=surprise,I have uh, some Princess friends that are a bit more familiar with that sort of thing.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:0,direction:down=chuckle,So strange, to think that you’re an alchemist, and an acclaimed one at that!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,How you can stand to work in the cold everyday is a mystery to me, Mei.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,direction:down=smirk,Women from the Land of Dragons prefer flowing silks. Much easier to move in.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:1,direction:down=dishonor,It must be nice to have someone help you undress.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2,direction:down=dishonor,She's right, Crown Prince. It's dishonorable to exploit the rules.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3,direction:down=denial,<i>Headphones?</i> Now you're pulling my leg, Crown Prince Miko.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Your dress is so short, though… are you preparing for war, Nagisa?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0,direction:down=peace,When you return to your realm, if you would kindly pass on a good word to my ancestors, this entire game will have been worth it.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1,direction:down=smirk,I do like my sash, but that looks fairly... magical.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0,direction:down=denial,Wait, how'd you do that? Sorcery!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0,direction:down=denial,A pirate, a smuggler, and a murderer for hire.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3,direction:down=surprise,Though… it isn’t like I haven’t had to be flexible with the concept of honor in my life…
5-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,direction:down=smirk,Are you a Hun? I’ve fought and triumphed over many barbarians just like you.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Ah, so sorry. I keep forgetting that I’m not in the Land of Dragons anymore.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0,direction:down=joy,You have a warrior's presence to you, Sayaka.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:0,direction:down=joy,And a pilot…
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1,direction:down=peace,Those look quite soft and silent. You... are a warrior, aren't you?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:syrenne,targetStage:1,direction:down=joy,Though, if you were a <i>boy</i> this'd be quite the chance to tell you you were <i>strapping.</i>.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:0,direction:down=smirk,You certainly don't dress like a mortal...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Are scarves popular in your deific realm, Zizou?
5-female_removed_accessory,notSaidMarker:roster_admit,marker:roster_admit,direction:down=chuckle,It’s actually quite a challenge to get on the roster as a woman. I suppose I appreciate you not going easy on me.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,I get it! You must talk to plants! That’s quite the talent.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,I see! Did you come to look at <i>spears</i> tonight, Catria?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1,direction:down=joy,Love the hairstyle and qipao, Chun-Li. I feel like we’re gonna be good friends.

6-female_removing_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Perhaps poisoned...? Cursed...? Kidnapped? Held at ransom? Made a deal with a witch...? Daddy issues?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:0,direction:down=yikes,Her outfit is... quite interesting. I guess her wrists will be cute...
6-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1,direction:down=yikes,Did... is this why she fell for my disguise? <i>Oh no.</i>
6-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0,direction:down=challenge,Well, I suppose there’s <i>many</i> types of affection.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:0,direction:down=peace,Most witches I know tend to cause a lot of trouble for princesses...
6-female_removing_accessory,target:mae,targetStage:0,direction:down=joy,Mae, is everyone from your world... do they all seem to be animals...?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,direction:down=surprise,I have uh, some Princess friends that are a bit more familiar with that sort of thing.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:0,direction:down=chuckle,So strange, to think that you’re an alchemist, and an acclaimed one at that!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,How you can stand to work in the cold everyday is a mystery to me, Mei.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,direction:down=smirk,Women from the Land of Dragons prefer flowing silks. Much easier to move in.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:1,direction:down=dishonor,It must be nice to have someone help you undress.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2,direction:down=dishonor,She's right, Crown Prince. It's dishonorable to exploit the rules.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3,direction:down=denial,<i>Headphones?</i> Now you're pulling my leg, Crown Prince Miko.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Your dress is so short, though… are you preparing for war, Nagisa?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0,direction:down=peace,When you return to your realm, if you would kindly pass on a good word to my ancestors, this entire game will have been worth it.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1,direction:down=smirk,I do like my sash, but that looks fairly... magical.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0,direction:down=denial,Wait, how'd you do that? Sorcery!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0,direction:down=denial,A pirate, a smuggler, and a murderer for hire.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3,direction:down=surprise,Though… it isn’t like I haven’t had to be flexible with the concept of honor in my life…
6-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,direction:down=smirk,Are you a Hun? I’ve fought and triumphed over many barbarians just like you.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Ah, so sorry. I keep forgetting that I’m not in the Land of Dragons anymore.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0,direction:down=joy,You have a warrior's presence to you, Sayaka.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:0,direction:down=joy,And a pilot…
6-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1,direction:down=peace,Those look quite soft and silent. You... are a warrior, aren't you?
6-female_removing_accessory,target:syrenne,targetStage:1,direction:down=joy,Though, if you were a <i>boy</i> this'd be quite the chance to tell you you were <i>strapping.</i>.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:0,direction:down=smirk,You certainly don't dress like a mortal...
6-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Are scarves popular in your deific realm, Zizou?
6-female_removed_accessory,direction:down=interested,Next time, let’s do strip arm wrestling… that’s… uh, definitely a thing.
6-female_removed_accessory,direction:down=dishonor,Ai-yah! You aren’t even layering big things, ~name~!
6-female_removed_accessory,direction:down=peace,It’s cute. Your ~clothing~. I mean, you too, truth be told.
6-female_removed_accessory,direction:down=yikes,You aren’t seriously expecting me to beg for mercy? I <i>will</i> offer you a firm handshake for luck, though.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,I get it! You must talk to plants! That’s quite the talent.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,I see! Did you come to look at <i>spears</i> tonight, Catria?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1,direction:down=joy,Love the hairstyle and qipao, Chun-Li. I feel like we’re gonna be good friends.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,And to let you wear such a feminine outfit… That Overwatch place is doing something right.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1,direction:down=denial,Huh? You aren't a princess? You could've fooled me!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1,totalMales:0,direction:down=denial,I-I'm not familiar with princesses at all! That's why I asked. I guess a princess wouldn't just lift her skirt like that, though...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:4,direction:down=smirk,I guess every princess should have <i>some</i>thing that's iconic and special.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,<i>There</i> we go! I know a princess when I see one! Do you get the whole "singing about a dream," accompaniment, too? O-Oh. Y-you just have such a regal bearing...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,You should learn to use your bracelets to propel you to new heights, Ini. I did that once.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:2,direction:down=dishonor,<i>Sigh.</i> At least she's reasonably cute.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1,direction:down=joy,Let’s just say I’m sure both of us are familiar with various varieties and split the difference, hm, Kyu?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:larachel,targetStage:2,direction:down=joy,Okay, a <i>magical, holy princess.</i> Do you have some sort of friendly animal companion? A great singing voice? I've heard those things are pretty much standard.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,I know quite a few princesses. You seem to act more like them than the witches I usually hear about. A witch princess, even.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:2,direction:down=joy,It looks lovely! If you want to talk about bad hair days, you should meet Rapunzel. I think she's from a world near yours...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:mae,targetStage:1,direction:down=yikes,Oh-- am I...? Not seeing clearly? Pardon, this <i>is</i> a very exotic place. I could've sworn I saw you with cat ears.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,direction:down=yikes,If we could <i>not</i> ruin some surprises, Mahiru, I’d be quite grateful.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1,direction:down=joy,Thank you for continuing to do our people proud, Mei.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:2,direction:down=smirk,Perhaps I <i>should</i> talk to you about modernizing my armor… against the cold, if nothing else.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,As you can tell by my attire, I like to remain mobile. That looks... <i>very</i> tight.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,I hope you didn't plan to win by <i>deceiving</i> us, Crown Prince.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3,direction:down=surprise,Uh. Nevermind me. I'll just... be here. Eating my words.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4,direction:down=smirk,If I knew we could've come in our modern apparel, I could've forgone the bulky armor...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,Such a young girl, and so convicted. I imagine that your friends and ancestors are proud of you. Do they allow women in the army, from where you’re from?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Thank you, Lady Palutena, you honor me.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=surprise,Hm. I thought this would be a friendly game of cards...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1,direction:down=dishonor,I may keep secrets, but I don’t bring shame upon my ancestors with every action!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4,direction:down=dishonor,I don't think I take it your extreme, nor would I ever.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=denial,Though, it is much nicer to do so in cards or words rather than with swords or explosions or avalanches.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,You do have dragons where you’re from… right?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,I'm glad you're something of a witch-hunter. Many princesses struggle with witches, you know.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,I’m impressed! By a woman doing that kind of a job. Definitely really impressive. Really, really impressive.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,You're quite skilled at cards, Sheena! How are you doing those tricks...?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:2,direction:down=yikes,I just thought it odd that your clothing is so bright, but it seems designed to be stealthy.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:syrenne,targetStage:2,totalExposed:0-1,direction:down=chuckle,A bold declaration, considering how your competition's faring.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:syrenne,targetStage:2,totalExposed:2-5,direction:down=surprise,You're... doing surprisingly well, I'll admit.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,You're a little irreverent, Zizou. I suppose you don't require much... deference... from mortals.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:2,direction:down=joy,I see. I was wondering if... nevermind.


#lost covering
7-male_removing_accessory,direction:down=surprise,I’m normally a fast learner. How long have you been playing cards?
7-male_removing_accessory,direction:down=surprise,You still had your ~clothing~? I don’t even have ~clothing~ like that where I’m from!
7-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,I suppose royalty <i>are</i> kind of built like… uh, fine china.
7-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,direction:down=dishonor,Must be nice to get a new set every generation.
7-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:0,direction:down=dishonor,I'm no stranger to conflict, either, especially from nearby borders.
7-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1,direction:down=surprise,...Very forward, if you mean what I think--
7-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:0,direction:down=surprise,Wha-- what was that? So fast!
7-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,Think you can take me in a fight? I know all kinds of competitions, uh, big guy.
7-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,I certainly hope you didn't plan on holding back <i>now</i>.
7-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:proud,direction:down=surprise,How about what now?
7-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,direction:down=joy,What's your home world like? Are all the soldiers like you?
7-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,A sash or a banner is a fine way of showing one's colors.
7-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2,direction:down=joy,Who doesn't enjoy a bowl of hot soup, dumplings, and noodles? Especially with how cold this room is.
7-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,I... see.
7-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=yikes,It’s humbling to see you still so equipped. At least you showed up ready to win, ~name~.
7-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=dishonor,Wow, ~name~. Taking a victory lap already? You’ve earned it, anyway.
7-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,direction:down=yikes,He’s even pale and kind of translucent!
7-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2,direction:down=yikes,I had to inherit mine, even though my father’s got a… slightly different build.
7-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1,direction:down=surprise,I'm a little less... cavalier than you about it.
7-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,--oh. Not the sword <i>I</i> had been expecting, but a lovely blade.
7-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1,direction:down=dishonor,You know, I hadn't really considered that...
7-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,So you <i>can</i> stop time... I can think of a few uses for that.
7-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:3,direction:down=challenge,Man <i>or</i> woman, it's a virtue to fight someone so... persistent!
7-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:proud,direction:down=challenge,Do I need to tell you again not to underestimate me, Kamina? I don't mind proving it, either.
7-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,You certainly seem capable. I'm looking forward to further displays of bravery, here.
7-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,direction:down=joy,In my land, yellow is associated with rising spirits. I suppose with your wings, you're used to basking in the sunlight.
7-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3,direction:down=chuckle,It's a challenge. Ryuji, if you win, I'll buy noodles. If you lose, you'll buy noodles. Either way, we don't have to leave this place on an empty stomach.
7-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:4,direction:down=challenge,You're a little distracting, Ryuji. You remind me of an old captain. Have you ever been a captain?
7-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=denial,There’s really no need to be a sore winner.
7-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=interested,This has been a fun way to get to know each other.
7-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=surprise,Your ~clothing~? You’re going to have to teach me that one.
7-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=joy,A flowing stream smoothes all edges.
7-female_removing_accessory,target:larachel,targetStage:1,count-princess:1-2,id:2,direction:down=surprise,Oh! She's a princess! This all makes a lot more sense. I've always been excited to meet new princesses!
7-female_removing_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:0,direction:down=yikes,Do you sing to animals, or…
7-female_removing_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:0,direction:down=yikes,Maybe taking off your weapon first is good form for a game like this... I hope keeping mine as long as I did wasn't rude.
7-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,direction:down=denial,I know a thing or two about that.
7-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,In uh, my experience, that’s a bit unusual.
7-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0,direction:down=smirk,I didn't know they had an American Princess besides Tiana!
7-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3,direction:down=joy,Slowing down the game a bit seems reasonable. No reason to rush to the climax, right?

-3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,I suppose royalty <i>are</i> kind of built like… uh, fine china.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,direction:down=dishonor,Must be nice to get a new set every generation.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:0,direction:down=dishonor,I'm no stranger to conflict, either, especially from nearby borders.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1,direction:down=surprise,...Very forward, if you mean what I think--
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:0,direction:down=surprise,Wha-- what was that? So fast!
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,Think you can take me in a fight? I know all kinds of competitions, uh, big guy.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,I certainly hope you didn't plan on holding back <i>now</i>.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:proud,direction:down=surprise,How about what now?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,direction:down=joy,What's your home world like? Are all the soldiers like you?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,A sash or a banner is a fine way of showing one's colors.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2,direction:down=joy,Who doesn't enjoy a bowl of hot soup, dumplings, and noodles? Especially with how cold this room is.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,I... see.
-3-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=yikes,It’s humbling to see you still so equipped. At least you showed up ready to win, ~name~.
-3-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=dishonor,Wow, ~name~. Taking a victory lap already? You’ve earned it, anyway.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,direction:down=yikes,He’s even pale and kind of translucent!
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2,direction:down=yikes,I had to inherit mine, even though my father’s got a… slightly different build.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1,direction:down=surprise,I'm a little less... cavalier than you about it.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,--oh. Not the sword <i>I</i> had been expecting, but a lovely blade.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1,direction:down=dishonor,You know, I hadn't really considered that...
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,So you <i>can</i> stop time... I can think of a few uses for that.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:3,direction:down=challenge,Man <i>or</i> woman, it's a virtue to fight someone so... persistent!
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:proud,direction:down=challenge,Do I need to tell you again not to underestimate me, Kamina? I don't mind proving it, either.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,You certainly seem capable. I'm looking forward to further displays of bravery, here.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,direction:down=joy,In my land, yellow is associated with rising spirits. I suppose with your wings, you're used to basking in the sunlight.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3,direction:down=chuckle,It's a challenge. Ryuji, if you win, I'll buy noodles. If you lose, you'll buy noodles. Either way, we don't have to leave this place on an empty stomach.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:4,direction:down=challenge,You're a little distracting, Ryuji. You remind me of an old captain. Have you ever been a captain?
-3-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=denial,There’s really no need to be a sore winner.
-3-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=interested,This has been a fun way to get to know each other.
-3-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=surprise,Your ~clothing~? You’re going to have to teach me that one.
-3-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=joy,A flowing stream smoothes all edges.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:larachel,targetStage:1,count-princess:1-2,id:2,direction:down=surprise,Oh! She's a princess! This all makes a lot more sense. I've always been excited to meet new princesses!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:0,direction:down=yikes,Do you sing to animals, or…
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:0,direction:down=yikes,Maybe taking off your weapon first is good form for a game like this... I hope keeping mine as long as I did wasn't rude.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,direction:down=denial,I know a thing or two about that.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,In uh, my experience, that’s a bit unusual.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0,direction:down=smirk,I didn't know they had an American Princess besides Tiana!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3,direction:down=joy,Slowing down the game a bit seems reasonable. No reason to rush to the climax, right?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Perhaps poisoned...? Cursed...? Kidnapped? Held at ransom? Made a deal with a witch...? Daddy issues?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:0,direction:down=yikes,Her outfit is... quite interesting. I guess her wrists will be cute...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1,direction:down=yikes,Did... is this why she fell for my disguise? <i>Oh no.</i>
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0,direction:down=challenge,Well, I suppose there’s <i>many</i> types of affection.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:0,direction:down=peace,Most witches I know tend to cause a lot of trouble for princesses...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mae,targetStage:0,direction:down=joy,Mae, is everyone from your world... do they all seem to be animals...?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,direction:down=surprise,I have uh, some Princess friends that are a bit more familiar with that sort of thing.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:0,direction:down=chuckle,So strange, to think that you’re an alchemist, and an acclaimed one at that!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,How you can stand to work in the cold everyday is a mystery to me, Mei.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,direction:down=smirk,Women from the Land of Dragons prefer flowing silks. Much easier to move in.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:1,direction:down=dishonor,It must be nice to have someone help you undress.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2,direction:down=dishonor,She's right, Crown Prince. It's dishonorable to exploit the rules.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3,direction:down=denial,<i>Headphones?</i> Now you're pulling my leg, Crown Prince Miko.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Your dress is so short, though… are you preparing for war, Nagisa?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0,direction:down=peace,When you return to your realm, if you would kindly pass on a good word to my ancestors, this entire game will have been worth it.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1,direction:down=smirk,I do like my sash, but that looks fairly... magical.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0,direction:down=denial,Wait, how'd you do that? Sorcery!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0,direction:down=denial,A pirate, a smuggler, and a murderer for hire.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3,direction:down=surprise,Though… it isn’t like I haven’t had to be flexible with the concept of honor in my life…
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,direction:down=smirk,Are you a Hun? I’ve fought and triumphed over many barbarians just like you.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Ah, so sorry. I keep forgetting that I’m not in the Land of Dragons anymore.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0,direction:down=joy,You have a warrior's presence to you, Sayaka.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:0,direction:down=joy,And a pilot…
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1,direction:down=peace,Those look quite soft and silent. You... are a warrior, aren't you?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:syrenne,targetStage:1,direction:down=joy,Though, if you were a <i>boy</i> this'd be quite the chance to tell you you were <i>strapping.</i>.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:0,direction:down=smirk,You certainly don't dress like a mortal...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Are scarves popular in your deific realm, Zizou?
-3-female_removed_accessory,direction:down=interested,Next time, let’s do strip arm wrestling… that’s… uh, definitely a thing.
-3-female_removed_accessory,direction:down=dishonor,Ai-yah! You aren’t even layering big things, ~name~!
-3-female_removed_accessory,direction:down=peace,It’s cute. Your ~clothing~. I mean, you too, truth be told.
-3-female_removed_accessory,direction:down=yikes,You aren’t seriously expecting me to beg for mercy? I <i>will</i> offer you a firm handshake for luck, though.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,I get it! You must talk to plants! That’s quite the talent.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,I see! Did you come to look at <i>spears</i> tonight, Catria?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1,direction:down=joy,Love the hairstyle and qipao, Chun-Li. I feel like we’re gonna be good friends.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,And to let you wear such a feminine outfit… That Overwatch place is doing something right.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1,direction:down=denial,Huh? You aren't a princess? You could've fooled me!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1,totalMales:0,direction:down=denial,I-I'm not familiar with princesses at all! That's why I asked. I guess a princess wouldn't just lift her skirt like that, though...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:4,direction:down=smirk,I guess every princess should have <i>some</i>thing that's iconic and special.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,<i>There</i> we go! I know a princess when I see one! Do you get the whole "singing about a dream," accompaniment, too? O-Oh. Y-you just have such a regal bearing...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,You should learn to use your bracelets to propel you to new heights, Ini. I did that once.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:2,direction:down=dishonor,<i>Sigh.</i> At least she's reasonably cute.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1,direction:down=joy,Let’s just say I’m sure both of us are familiar with various varieties and split the difference, hm, Kyu?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:larachel,targetStage:2,direction:down=joy,Okay, a <i>magical, holy princess.</i> Do you have some sort of friendly animal companion? A great singing voice? I've heard those things are pretty much standard.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,I know quite a few princesses. You seem to act more like them than the witches I usually hear about. A witch princess, even.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:2,direction:down=joy,It looks lovely! If you want to talk about bad hair days, you should meet Rapunzel. I think she's from a world near yours...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mae,targetStage:1,direction:down=yikes,Oh-- am I...? Not seeing clearly? Pardon, this <i>is</i> a very exotic place. I could've sworn I saw you with cat ears.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,direction:down=yikes,If we could <i>not</i> ruin some surprises, Mahiru, I’d be quite grateful.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1,direction:down=joy,Thank you for continuing to do our people proud, Mei.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:2,direction:down=smirk,Perhaps I <i>should</i> talk to you about modernizing my armor… against the cold, if nothing else.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,As you can tell by my attire, I like to remain mobile. That looks... <i>very</i> tight.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,I hope you didn't plan to win by <i>deceiving</i> us, Crown Prince.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3,direction:down=surprise,Uh. Nevermind me. I'll just... be here. Eating my words.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4,direction:down=smirk,If I knew we could've come in our modern apparel, I could've forgone the bulky armor...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,Such a young girl, and so convicted. I imagine that your friends and ancestors are proud of you. Do they allow women in the army, from where you’re from?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Thank you, Lady Palutena, you honor me.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=surprise,Hm. I thought this would be a friendly game of cards...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1,direction:down=dishonor,I may keep secrets, but I don’t bring shame upon my ancestors with every action!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4,direction:down=dishonor,I don't think I take it your extreme, nor would I ever.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=denial,Though, it is much nicer to do so in cards or words rather than with swords or explosions or avalanches.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,You do have dragons where you’re from… right?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,I'm glad you're something of a witch-hunter. Many princesses struggle with witches, you know.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,I’m impressed! By a woman doing that kind of a job. Definitely really impressive. Really, really impressive.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,You're quite skilled at cards, Sheena! How are you doing those tricks...?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:2,direction:down=yikes,I just thought it odd that your clothing is so bright, but it seems designed to be stealthy.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:syrenne,targetStage:2,totalExposed:0-1,direction:down=chuckle,A bold declaration, considering how your competition's faring.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:syrenne,targetStage:2,totalExposed:2-5,direction:down=surprise,You're... doing surprisingly well, I'll admit.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,You're a little irreverent, Zizou. I suppose you don't require much... deference... from mortals.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:2,direction:down=joy,I see. I was wondering if... nevermind.

-2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1,direction:down=joy,Let’s just say I’m sure both of us are familiar with various varieties and split the difference, hm, Kyu?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:larachel,targetStage:2,direction:down=joy,Okay, a <i>magical, holy princess.</i> Do you have some sort of friendly animal companion? A great singing voice? I've heard those things are pretty much standard.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,I know quite a few princesses. You seem to act more like them than the witches I usually hear about. A witch princess, even.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:2,direction:down=joy,It looks lovely! If you want to talk about bad hair days, you should meet Rapunzel. I think she's from a world near yours...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mae,targetStage:1,direction:down=yikes,Oh-- am I...? Not seeing clearly? Pardon, this <i>is</i> a very exotic place. I could've sworn I saw you with cat ears.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1,direction:down=yikes,If we could <i>not</i> ruin some surprises, Mahiru, I’d be quite grateful.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1,direction:down=joy,Thank you for continuing to do our people proud, Mei.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:2,direction:down=smirk,Perhaps I <i>should</i> talk to you about modernizing my armor… against the cold, if nothing else.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,As you can tell by my attire, I like to remain mobile. That looks... <i>very</i> tight.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,I hope you didn't plan to win by <i>deceiving</i> us, Crown Prince.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3,direction:down=surprise,Uh. Nevermind me. I'll just... be here. Eating my words.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4,direction:down=smirk,If I knew we could've come in our modern apparel, I could've forgone the bulky armor...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,Such a young girl, and so convicted. I imagine that your friends and ancestors are proud of you. Do they allow women in the army, from where you’re from?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Thank you, Lady Palutena, you honor me.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=surprise,Hm. I thought this would be a friendly game of cards...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1,direction:down=dishonor,I may keep secrets, but I don’t bring shame upon my ancestors with every action!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4,direction:down=dishonor,I don't think I take it your extreme, nor would I ever.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=denial,Though, it is much nicer to do so in cards or words rather than with swords or explosions or avalanches.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,You do have dragons where you’re from… right?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,I'm glad you're something of a witch-hunter. Many princesses struggle with witches, you know.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,I’m impressed! By a woman doing that kind of a job. Definitely really impressive. Really, really impressive.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,You're quite skilled at cards, Sheena! How are you doing those tricks...?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:2,direction:down=yikes,I just thought it odd that your clothing is so bright, but it seems designed to be stealthy.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:syrenne,targetStage:2,totalExposed:0-1,direction:down=chuckle,A bold declaration, considering how your competition's faring.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:syrenne,targetStage:2,totalExposed:2-5,direction:down=surprise,You're... doing surprisingly well, I'll admit.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,You're a little irreverent, Zizou. I suppose you don't require much... deference... from mortals.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:2,direction:down=joy,I see. I was wondering if... nevermind.


#finished
-1-male_removing_accessory,direction:down=surprise,I’m… a little embarrassed you had something so small left!
-1-male_removing_accessory,direction:down=yikes,You didn’t seriously save your ~clothing~ until now?
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,I suppose royalty <i>are</i> kind of built like… uh, fine china.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,direction:down=dishonor,Must be nice to get a new set every generation.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:0,direction:down=dishonor,I'm no stranger to conflict, either, especially from nearby borders.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1,direction:down=surprise,...Very forward, if you mean what I think--
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:0,direction:down=surprise,Wha-- what was that? So fast!
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,Think you can take me in a fight? I know all kinds of competitions, uh, big guy.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,I certainly hope you didn't plan on holding back <i>now</i>.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:proud,direction:down=surprise,How about what now?
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,direction:down=joy,What's your home world like? Are all the soldiers like you?
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,A sash or a banner is a fine way of showing one's colors.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2,direction:down=joy,Who doesn't enjoy a bowl of hot soup, dumplings, and noodles? Especially with how cold this room is.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,I... see.
-1-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=surprise,<i>Ai-yah</i>! I was out of my league!
-1-male_removed_accessory,direction:down=denial,I’d say I was out of my depth, but I just… was in my depth, you know?
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,direction:down=yikes,He’s even pale and kind of translucent!
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2,direction:down=yikes,I had to inherit mine, even though my father’s got a… slightly different build.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1,direction:down=surprise,I'm a little less... cavalier than you about it.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,--oh. Not the sword <i>I</i> had been expecting, but a lovely blade.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1,direction:down=dishonor,You know, I hadn't really considered that...
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,So you <i>can</i> stop time... I can think of a few uses for that.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:3,direction:down=challenge,Man <i>or</i> woman, it's a virtue to fight someone so... persistent!
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:proud,direction:down=challenge,Do I need to tell you again not to underestimate me, Kamina? I don't mind proving it, either.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,You certainly seem capable. I'm looking forward to further displays of bravery, here.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2,direction:down=joy,In my land, yellow is associated with rising spirits. I suppose with your wings, you're used to basking in the sunlight.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3,direction:down=chuckle,It's a challenge. Ryuji, if you win, I'll buy noodles. If you lose, you'll buy noodles. Either way, we don't have to leave this place on an empty stomach.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:4,direction:down=challenge,You're a little distracting, Ryuji. You remind me of an old captain. Have you ever been a captain?
-1-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=dishonor,I’m… a little embarrassed you had something so small left!
-1-female_removing_accessory,direction:down=denial,You didn’t seriously save your ~clothing~ until now?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:larachel,targetStage:1,count-princess:1-2,id:2,direction:down=surprise,Oh! She's a princess! This all makes a lot more sense. I've always been excited to meet new princesses!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:0,direction:down=yikes,Do you sing to animals, or…
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:0,direction:down=yikes,Maybe taking off your weapon first is good form for a game like this... I hope keeping mine as long as I did wasn't rude.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0,direction:down=denial,I know a thing or two about that.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,In uh, my experience, that’s a bit unusual.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0,direction:down=smirk,I didn't know they had an American Princess besides Tiana!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3,direction:down=joy,Slowing down the game a bit seems reasonable. No reason to rush to the climax, right?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Perhaps poisoned...? Cursed...? Kidnapped? Held at ransom? Made a deal with a witch...? Daddy issues?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:0,direction:down=yikes,Her outfit is... quite interesting. I guess her wrists will be cute...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1,direction:down=yikes,Did... is this why she fell for my disguise? <i>Oh no.</i>
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0,direction:down=challenge,Well, I suppose there’s <i>many</i> types of affection.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:0,direction:down=peace,Most witches I know tend to cause a lot of trouble for princesses...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mae,targetStage:0,direction:down=joy,Mae, is everyone from your world... do they all seem to be animals...?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,direction:down=surprise,I have uh, some Princess friends that are a bit more familiar with that sort of thing.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:0,direction:down=chuckle,So strange, to think that you’re an alchemist, and an acclaimed one at that!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,How you can stand to work in the cold everyday is a mystery to me, Mei.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,direction:down=smirk,Women from the Land of Dragons prefer flowing silks. Much easier to move in.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:1,direction:down=dishonor,It must be nice to have someone help you undress.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2,direction:down=dishonor,She's right, Crown Prince. It's dishonorable to exploit the rules.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3,direction:down=denial,<i>Headphones?</i> Now you're pulling my leg, Crown Prince Miko.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0,direction:down=interested,Your dress is so short, though… are you preparing for war, Nagisa?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0,direction:down=peace,When you return to your realm, if you would kindly pass on a good word to my ancestors, this entire game will have been worth it.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1,direction:down=smirk,I do like my sash, but that looks fairly... magical.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0,direction:down=denial,Wait, how'd you do that? Sorcery!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0,direction:down=denial,A pirate, a smuggler, and a murderer for hire.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3,direction:down=surprise,Though… it isn’t like I haven’t had to be flexible with the concept of honor in my life…
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0,direction:down=smirk,Are you a Hun? I’ve fought and triumphed over many barbarians just like you.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Ah, so sorry. I keep forgetting that I’m not in the Land of Dragons anymore.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0,direction:down=joy,You have a warrior's presence to you, Sayaka.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:0,direction:down=joy,And a pilot…
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1,direction:down=peace,Those look quite soft and silent. You... are a warrior, aren't you?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:syrenne,targetStage:1,direction:down=joy,Though, if you were a <i>boy</i> this'd be quite the chance to tell you you were <i>strapping.</i>.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:0,direction:down=smirk,You certainly don't dress like a mortal...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Are scarves popular in your deific realm, Zizou?
-1-female_removed_accessory,direction:down=surprise,<i>Ai-yah</i>! I was out of my league!
-1-female_removed_accessory,direction:down=surprise,I’d say I was out of my depth, but I just… was in my depth, you know?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,I get it! You must talk to plants! That’s quite the talent.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:catria,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,I see! Did you come to look at <i>spears</i> tonight, Catria?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1,direction:down=joy,Love the hairstyle and qipao, Chun-Li. I feel like we’re gonna be good friends.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,And to let you wear such a feminine outfit… That Overwatch place is doing something right.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1,direction:down=denial,Huh? You aren't a princess? You could've fooled me!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1,totalMales:0,direction:down=denial,I-I'm not familiar with princesses at all! That's why I asked. I guess a princess wouldn't just lift her skirt like that, though...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:4,direction:down=smirk,I guess every princess should have <i>some</i>thing that's iconic and special.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,<i>There</i> we go! I know a princess when I see one! Do you get the whole "singing about a dream," accompaniment, too? O-Oh. Y-you just have such a regal bearing...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,You should learn to use your bracelets to propel you to new heights, Ini. I did that once.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:ini,targetStage:2,direction:down=dishonor,<i>Sigh.</i> At least she's reasonably cute.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1,direction:down=joy,Let’s just say I’m sure both of us are familiar with various varieties and split the difference, hm, Kyu?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:larachel,targetStage:2,direction:down=joy,Okay, a <i>magical, holy princess.</i> Do you have some sort of friendly animal companion? A great singing voice? I've heard those things are pretty much standard.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,I know quite a few princesses. You seem to act more like them than the witches I usually hear about. A witch princess, even.

#OPPONENT REMOVING MINOR CLOTHING
#Minor pieces of clothing don't reveal much when removed, but probably indicate more progress than accessory removal.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written
male_removing_minor,direction:down=interested,~name~, if you want me to make a man out of you, you’ll need to impress me.
male_removing_minor,direction:down=joy,There we go. A mystery for a mystery.
male_removed_minor,direction:down=challenge,Not bad. More things like your ~clothing~ and you’ll be out in no time at all.
male_removed_minor,direction:down=challenge,I'm no perfect porcelain doll. More like a training dummy. Uh, but smart. You can take more off next time, ~name~.
female_removing_minor,direction:down=joy,Impressive, ~clothing~!
female_removing_minor,direction:down=interested,Your ~clothing~?
female_removing_minor,direction:down=peace,~Clothing~, huh?
female_removed_minor,direction:down=interested,Are you going to be delaying the game any further? I don’t mind a chase.
female_removed_minor,direction:down=peace,Not bad, not bad, but I definitely see more than that in the mirror every morning. You’re in good company, ~name~, let’s keep it light and keep it fun.
female_removed_minor,direction:down=smirk,Well, fortune favors the bold, so I guess I’ll just have to keep beating you, ~name~.


#stage-specific lines that override the stage-generic ones

#fully clothed
0-male_removing_minor,direction:down=surprise,There we go, looking good, uh, big stuff.
0-male_removing_minor,direction:down=joy,Impressive ~clothing~! A respectable thing to remove while you still have it.
0-male_removing_minor,direction:down=chuckle,~Clothing~. ~Clothing~! Can you believe this guy?
0-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,Oh. You have... quite a broad chest.
0-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3,direction:down=chuckle,You won't be walking anywhere, Jin? But how will the ladies guide you home?
0-male_removing_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,You can't seriously keep up the serious facade the whole game, can you?
0-male_removing_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:3,direction:down=joy,Honestly, not much of my clothing ends up being tailored to me.
0-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,Sorry, all the talk of manliness really makes me think of myself. Obviously.
0-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,As a poet once said... deep roots stop the greatest oaks from falling...
0-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:6,direction:down=yikes,As Ping or...
0-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0,direction:down=chuckle,It reminds me of a man I once knew, named Sora.
0-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0,direction:down=joy,You seem... very normal, all told.
0-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,If you had some plaid on your pants, you'd be a dead ringer for one of Merida's brothers...
0-male_removed_minor,direction:down=interested,Nice ~clothing~. Looks good on the floor, though. Covered in dirt, like men like us do. After long battles and training in mud. Heh-heh.
0-male_removed_minor,direction:down=peace,I know men are supposed to be as swift as a coursing river, but why don’t you hold back a little, ~name~, really let the ladies enjoy a big, strong guy removing his ~clothing~?
0-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3,direction:down=dishonor,I'm uh, used to girls doing the flourish you're doing. Both of the jacket and of the trivia.
0-male_removed_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:3,direction:down=surprise,It's hard not to stare. You're so striking!
0-male_removed_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,I would want to keep something like that in good condition, personally.
0-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:2,marker:mulan_chest_wraps,direction:down=interested,I've known a few women who wear wraps like that for combat... around their chests. But I'm glad I-- <i>we</i> can see yours.
0-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:5,direction:down=challenge,...and I'd wager you're made of stronger stuff than that, aren't you, Kamina?
0-male_removed_minor,target:pit,targetStage:3,direction:down=surprise,Oh, no, Pit. Nothing at all. Only master warriors tend to wear white, since they can avoid getting dirt or blood on it. Impressive.
0-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1,direction:down=smirk,I imagine the two of you would get along well!
0-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:2,direction:down=dishonor,Are you certain you don't know any of these people? Hm. I suppose the world is a large enough place...
0-female_removing_minor,direction:down=joy,Not too big, not too small, without your ~clothing~, you'll bring honor to us all, ~name~. Aw, it's from a song.
0-female_removing_minor,direction:down=smirk,Not bad, ~name~, but I'm going to want to see more before I take off my armor. Uh, that's reasonable, right?
0-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,count-jasmine:1,direction:down=joy,I <i>was</i> curious about what that gem was. It reminds me of Princess Jasmine's, in some of her outfits.
0-female_removing_minor,target:aella,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,I’ve got a lot of respect for a woman who’s willing to go out into the world and fight for a cause she respects and people she loves.
0-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Oh, your gloves? I... tend to like wrists.
0-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,Of <i>course</i> you can't sit out the next few rounds, Catria.
0-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,You know, I <i>do</i> have quite a lot of experience with armor, Catria. If you want help...
0-female_removing_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1,direction:down=surprise,Are you sure you aren't a princess, Elizabeth? You're awfully coy...
0-female_removing_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:5,direction:down=joy,Don't worry, Elizabeth. A lady needs nice legs. I feel like my legs are suitable for a soldier.
0-female_removing_minor,target:haru,targetStage:1,direction:down=smirk,Your outfit and demeanor remind me of the princesses I-- have rescued!
0-female_removing_minor,target:haru,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,Everything about you seems so fluffy and comfortable! I sense a great calm about you. You must be quite a source of strength for your allies.

2-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,You know, I <i>do</i> have quite a lot of experience with armor, Catria. If you want help...
2-female_removing_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1,direction:down=surprise,Are you sure you aren't a princess, Elizabeth? You're awfully coy...
2-female_removing_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:5,direction:down=joy,Don't worry, Elizabeth. A lady needs nice legs. I feel like my legs are suitable for a soldier.
2-female_removing_minor,target:haru,targetStage:1,direction:down=smirk,Your outit and demeanor are of one accustomed to authority and kindness... but not free from hardship.
2-female_removing_minor,target:haru,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,Everything about you seems so fluffy and comfortable! I sense a great calm about you. You must be quite a source of strength for your allies.

2-female_removing_minor,target:larachel,targetStage:2,direction:down=dishonor,Your boots are nice and all that... but how do you get your hair looking so pretty? Just the perk of being a princess, or...?
2-female_removing_minor,target:larachel,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,I have a question... do you usually have an attendent help you out with this? I never... had an adjutant for that or anything but...
2-female_removing_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:2,direction:down=dishonor,I'm surprised you gave up your wand so quickly, Lotte.
2-female_removing_minor,target:mae,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,I see you've had a hard time finding somewhere to belong, haven't you?
2-female_removing_minor,target:mae,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:nightmarefeet,targetSayingMarker:nightmarefeet2,direction:down=chuckle,I don't suppose we have much of a choice... regular or nightmare feet, that is. <i>Trust me,</i> I've seen nightmare feet of <i>many</i> varieties.
2-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,direction:down=surprise,Oh. Of course, taking off armor is quite the challenge for men and women.
2-female_removing_minor,target:miko,targetStage:0,direction:down=yikes,<i>Ai-yah!</i> A spirit?! You truly must be a powerful Taoist magician indeed!
2-female_removing_minor,target:raven,targetStage:0,direction:down=denial,You're treating it like no big deal!
2-female_removing_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Most of the Princesses I know who use magic don't use it to show off...
2-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,direction:down=joy,I <i>was</i> curious about what that gem was. It reminds me of... attire a woman I knew wore.
2-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:0,direction:down=chuckle,You are <i>such</i> a sweet one, Sayori.
2-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1,direction:down=peace,I see woman everywhere like lots of layers... I'm surprised your outfit is so... drab.
2-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:2,direction:down=dishonor,I suppose if you're here to bond with someone, you would want to be fast about it...
2-female_removing_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:2,direction:down=smirk,I'm a fan of the sash, and your outfit. Loose, flowing clothes are <i>so</i> much better than heavy armor...
2-female_removing_minor,target:syrenne,targetStage:2,direction:down=surprise,Oh... that's... an old superstition. I didn't mean to imply...
2-female_removing_minor,target:syrenne,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,I see. I see also your... what are those? They're very... I haven't seen a piece of armor like <i>those</i> before.
2-female_removing_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,direction:down=smirk,Purple hair, a matching outfit…
2-female_removed_minor,target:aella,targetStage:3,direction:down=challenge,I find it… relatable.
2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,direction:down=yikes,I have a vague worry that you’re going to hit someone by the end of this… and that’s not really in good taste…
2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,direction:down=yikes,I’ve blown up a cannon on myself before, but nothing like this…
2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,direction:down=denial,This can’t actually be that dangerous, can it?
2-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2,direction:down=denial,They're very useful, if you know how to use them! They say a lot about a person. Catria's very strong, but also delicate. These are good traits in a woman. So I hear.
2-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2,direction:down=surprise,Oh. I'm sorry if I was staring. You can just tell a lot about someone by their wrists.
2-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:3,direction:down=smirk,Oh? <i>Furs</i>? Now, I'm not a stranger to army humor. I know <i>exactly</i> what you mean, Catria. I guess we'll see <i>your</i> fur in a few hands.
2-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:4,direction:down=denial,You know, I always figure you have to be smaller than your armor... but your chest is... it's dangerous to have oversized equipment. Trust me on this.
2-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,Well, if you <i>aren't</i> a princess, I suppose you wouldn't mind <i>getting to know</i> a commoner like me, right?
2-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2,totalMales:0,direction:down=surprise,Oh! Yes. Absolutely no lecherous thoughts, Elizabeth. None. Whatsoever.
2-female_removed_minor,target:haru,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,In another world, you would've been a great princess. Thought, doubtless, you're quite skilled in what you do.
2-female_removed_minor,target:haru,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,I'm... a little surprised by your lack of optimism, Miss Haru. I've certainly enjoyed the last few hands together.
2-female_removed_minor,target:jasmine,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,<i>Haha,</i> take a joke, Miss.
2-female_removed_minor,target:juri,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,Keeping your composure is important, but, really, why not consider fighting for justice rather than evil?
2-female_removed_minor,target:kizuna,totalNaked:1,priority:990,marker:ai_duel,direction:down=challenge,Ai-chan, you lost the bet! Are you truly that oblivious, or is this all an act? You are aware you aren't the player, right?
2-female_removed_minor,target:larachel,targetStage:1,direction:down=smirk,Well, I admire your courage for attending to your friend in a game like this.
2-female_removed_minor,target:larachel,targetStage:3,direction:down=chuckle,I have a feeling the princess spends a little more time on her appearance than her prayers... such a vibrant shade of green, too!
2-female_removed_minor,target:larachel,targetStage:4,direction:down=smirk,I'm just surprised ~player~ isn't helping you get naked.
2-female_removed_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:3,direction:down=peace,I'm happy you're having fun, but surely a little magic would've helped your odds...?
2-female_removed_minor,target:mae,targetStage:2,direction:down=joy,I'm sure you'll find a place where, when you look in the mirror, you can see the you you want to be staring back, Mae.
2-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,direction:down=joy,I'm actually quite fascinated. I would be interested to see how your quartermaster prepares equipment like that.
2-female_removed_minor,target:miko,targetStage:1,direction:down=surprise,W-who is this, Crown Prince?
2-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1,direction:down=peace,Okay, be that way.
2-female_removed_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,I suppose it almost makes up for your lack of <i>actual</i> nobility and honor.
2-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,It's <i>interesting</i>  how you can have such a forward personality, but dress so femininely.
2-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1,direction:down=smirk,I think putting your clothes back on is cheating... but I'm sure ~player~ could keep you warm.
2-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:2,direction:down=joy,Your eyes, ribbons, and hair are so exotic! I'm surprised you dress in such earthy tones, Sayori.
2-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:3,direction:down=chuckle,It must be nice to be so carefree, Sayori.
2-female_removed_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:3,direction:down=chuckle,...for women and warrior-poets, anyway.
2-female_removed_minor,target:syrenne,targetStage:3,direction:down=peace,Well. Best to be continuing. Should I buy you a drink, Syrenne? Excuse my... poor choice of words.
2-female_removed_minor,target:syrenne,targetStage:4,direction:down=denial,They don't look like any pants I've ever seen. I'm no princess, but I'm not some country girl-- person-- soldier-- either!
2-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,I have... somewhat of an interest in wrists. They say so much about strength.
2-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:5,direction:down=yikes,I think feet can be... interesting. But I don't think they're as attractive.
2-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,Are you a Princess of some sort? You certainly carry yourself like one, I bet.

3-male_removed_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,I would want to keep something like that in good condition, personally.
3-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:2,direction:down=challenge,I hope you weren't planning on stopping there.

6-female_removed_minor,target:haru,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,I'm... a little surprised by your lack of optimism, Miss Haru. I've certainly enjoyed the last few hands together.

6-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1,direction:down=peace,Okay, be that way.
6-female_removed_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,I suppose it almost makes up for your lack of <i>actual</i> nobility and honor.
6-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,It's <i>interesting</i>  how you can have such a forward personality, but dress so femininely.
6-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1,direction:down=smirk,I think putting your clothes back on is cheating... but I'm sure ~player~ could keep you warm.
6-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:2,direction:down=joy,Your eyes, ribbons, and hair are so exotic! I'm surprised you dress in such earthy tones, Sayori.
6-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:3,direction:down=chuckle,It must be nice to be so carefree, Sayori.
6-female_removed_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:3,direction:down=chuckle,...for women and warrior-poets, anyway.
6-female_removed_minor,target:syrenne,targetStage:3,direction:down=peace,Well. Best to be continuing. Should I buy you a drink, Syrenne? Excuse my... poor choice of words.
6-female_removed_minor,target:syrenne,targetStage:4,direction:down=denial,They don't look like any pants I've ever seen. I'm no princess, but I'm not some country girl-- person-- soldier-- either!
6-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,I have... somewhat of an interest in wrists. They say so much about strength.

-3-female_removing_minor,direction:down=peace,Impressive ~clothing~, ~name~.
-3-female_removing_minor,direction:down=peace,It’s been nice seeing you in your ~clothing~, ~name~. But… let’s see what you look like out of it, too.
-3-female_removing_minor,direction:down=surprise,See, you still have lots to go.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,count-jasmine:1,direction:down=joy,I <i>was</i> curious about what that gem was. It reminds me of Princess Jasmine's, in some of her outfits.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:aella,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,I’ve got a lot of respect for a woman who’s willing to go out into the world and fight for a cause she respects and people she loves.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Oh, your gloves? I... tend to like wrists.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,Of <i>course</i> you can't sit out the next few rounds, Catria.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,You know, I <i>do</i> have quite a lot of experience with armor, Catria. If you want help...
-3-female_removing_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1,direction:down=surprise,Are you sure you aren't a princess, Elizabeth? You're awfully coy...
-3-female_removing_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:5,direction:down=joy,Don't worry, Elizabeth. A lady needs nice legs. I feel like my legs are suitable for a soldier.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:haru,targetStage:1,direction:down=smirk,Your outit and demeanor are of one accustomed to authority and kindness... but not free from hardship.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:haru,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,Everything about you seems so fluffy and comfortable! I sense a great calm about you. You must be quite a source of strength for your allies.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:jasmine,targetStage:0,direction:down=chuckle,♩ Don't be so shy-- ♩
-3-female_removing_minor,target:juri,targetStage:1,direction:down=peace,It's obvious you're quite a skilled warrior... but why not be honorable?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:larachel,targetStage:0,direction:down=chuckle,I <i>see</i>. One of those <i>Western</i> priestly women. I'm sure whatever you do in your convents is <i>totally</i> holy.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:larachel,targetStage:2,direction:down=dishonor,Your boots are nice and all that... but how do you get your hair looking so pretty? Just the perk of being a princess, or...?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:larachel,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,I have a question... do you usually have an attendent help you out with this? I never... had an adjutant for that or anything but...
-3-female_removing_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:2,direction:down=dishonor,I'm surprised you gave up your wand so quickly, Lotte.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:mae,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,I see you've had a hard time finding somewhere to belong, haven't you?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:mae,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:nightmarefeet,targetSayingMarker:nightmarefeet2,direction:down=chuckle,I don't suppose we have much of a choice... regular or nightmare feet, that is. <i>Trust me,</i> I've seen nightmare feet of <i>many</i> varieties.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,direction:down=surprise,Oh. Of course, taking off armor is quite the challenge for men and women.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:miko,targetStage:0,direction:down=yikes,<i>Ai-yah!</i> A spirit?! You truly must be a powerful Taoist magician indeed!
-3-female_removing_minor,target:raven,targetStage:0,direction:down=denial,You're treating it like no big deal!
-3-female_removing_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Most of the Princesses I know who use magic don't use it to show off...
-3-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,direction:down=joy,I <i>was</i> curious about what that gem was. It reminds me of... attire a woman I knew wore.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:0,direction:down=chuckle,You are <i>such</i> a sweet one, Sayori.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1,direction:down=peace,I see woman everywhere like lots of layers... I'm surprised your outfit is so... drab.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:2,direction:down=dishonor,I suppose if you're here to bond with someone, you would want to be fast about it...
-3-female_removing_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:2,direction:down=smirk,I'm a fan of the sash, and your outfit. Loose, flowing clothes are <i>so</i> much better than heavy armor...
-3-female_removing_minor,target:syrenne,targetStage:2,direction:down=surprise,Oh... that's... an old superstition. I didn't mean to imply...
-3-female_removing_minor,target:syrenne,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,I see. I see also your... what are those? They're very... I haven't seen a piece of armor like <i>those</i> before.
-3-female_removing_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,direction:down=smirk,Purple hair, a matching outfit…
-3-female_removed_minor,direction:down=smirk,Are you going to keep it up?
-3-female_removed_minor,direction:down=peace,Having fun, ~name~? It’s actually really exciting.
-3-female_removed_minor,direction:down=denial,You’re a bit like a piece of fruit. Best when peeled out of your ~clothing~, ~name~. Not your skin. Please leave that on.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:aella,targetStage:3,direction:down=challenge,I find it… relatable.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,direction:down=yikes,I have a vague worry that you’re going to hit someone by the end of this… and that’s not really in good taste…
-3-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,direction:down=yikes,I’ve blown up a cannon on myself before, but nothing like this…
-3-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,direction:down=denial,This can’t actually be that dangerous, can it?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2,direction:down=denial,They're very useful, if you know how to use them! They say a lot about a person. Catria's very strong, but also delicate. These are good traits in a woman. So I hear.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2,direction:down=surprise,Oh. I'm sorry if I was staring. You can just tell a lot about someone by their wrists.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:3,direction:down=smirk,Oh? <i>Furs</i>? Now, I'm not a stranger to army humor. I know <i>exactly</i> what you mean, Catria. I guess we'll see <i>your</i> fur in a few hands.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:4,direction:down=denial,You know, I always figure you have to be smaller than your armor... but your chest is... it's dangerous to have oversized equipment. Trust me on this.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,Well, if you <i>aren't</i> a princess, I suppose you wouldn't mind <i>getting to know</i> a commoner like me, right?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2,totalMales:0,direction:down=surprise,Oh! Yes. Absolutely no lecherous thoughts, Elizabeth. None. Whatsoever.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:haru,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,In another world, you would've been a great princess. Thought, doubtless, you're quite skilled in what you do.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:haru,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,I'm... a little surprised by your lack of optimism, Miss Haru. I've certainly enjoyed the last few hands together.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:jasmine,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,<i>Haha,</i> take a joke, Miss.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:juri,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,Keeping your composure is important, but, really, why not consider fighting for justice rather than evil?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:larachel,targetStage:1,direction:down=smirk,Well, I admire your courage for attending to your friend in a game like this.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:larachel,targetStage:3,direction:down=chuckle,I have a feeling the princess spends a little more time on her appearance than her prayers... such a vibrant shade of green, too!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:larachel,targetStage:4,direction:down=smirk,I'm just surprised ~player~ isn't helping you get naked.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:3,direction:down=peace,I'm happy you're having fun, but surely a little magic would've helped your odds...?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:mae,targetStage:2,direction:down=joy,I'm sure you'll find a place where, when you look in the mirror, you can see the you you want to be staring back, Mae.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,direction:down=joy,I'm actually quite fascinated. I would be interested to see how your quartermaster prepares equipment like that.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:miko,targetStage:1,direction:down=surprise,W-who is this, Crown Prince?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1,direction:down=peace,Okay, be that way.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,I suppose it almost makes up for your lack of <i>actual</i> nobility and honor.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,It's <i>interesting</i>  how you can have such a forward personality, but dress so femininely.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1,direction:down=smirk,I think putting your clothes back on is cheating... but I'm sure ~player~ could keep you warm.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:2,direction:down=joy,Your eyes, ribbons, and hair are so exotic! I'm surprised you dress in such earthy tones, Sayori.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:3,direction:down=chuckle,It must be nice to be so carefree, Sayori.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:3,direction:down=chuckle,...for women and warrior-poets, anyway.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:syrenne,targetStage:3,direction:down=peace,Well. Best to be continuing. Should I buy you a drink, Syrenne? Excuse my... poor choice of words.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:syrenne,targetStage:4,direction:down=denial,They don't look like any pants I've ever seen. I'm no princess, but I'm not some country girl-- person-- soldier-- either!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,I have... somewhat of an interest in wrists. They say so much about strength.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:5,direction:down=yikes,I think feet can be... interesting. But I don't think they're as attractive.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,Are you a Princess of some sort? You certainly carry yourself like one, I bet.

-2-male_removing_minor,direction:down=interested,Just ~clothing~?
-2-male_removing_minor,direction:down=peace,A little bigger than your ~clothing~ would’ve been nice...
-2-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,Oh. You have... quite a broad chest.
-2-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3,direction:down=chuckle,You won't be walking anywhere, Jin? But how will the ladies guide you home?
-2-male_removing_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,You can't seriously keep up the serious facade the whole game, can you?
-2-male_removing_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:3,direction:down=joy,Honestly, not much of my clothing ends up being tailored to me.
-2-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:1,direction:down=yikes,Forgive me. Let me try again, Kamina...
-2-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,As a poet once said... deep roots stop the greatest oaks from falling...
-2-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:6,direction:down=interested,As Ping <i>or</i> as Mulan...
-2-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0,direction:down=chuckle,It reminds me of a man I once knew, named Sora.
-2-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0,direction:down=joy,You seem... very normal, all told.
-2-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,If you had some plaid on your pants, you'd be a dead ringer for one of Merida's brothers...
-2-male_removed_minor,direction:down=peace,S-still, better by inches.
-2-male_removed_minor,direction:down=joy,A-ah, there we go.
-2-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3,direction:down=dishonor,I'm uh, used to girls doing the flourish you're doing. Both of the jacket and of the trivia.
-2-male_removed_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:3,direction:down=surprise,It's hard not to stare. You're so striking!
-2-male_removed_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,I would want to keep something like that in good condition, personally.
-2-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:2,direction:down=challenge,I hope you weren't planning on stopping there.
-2-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:5,direction:down=challenge,...and I'd wager you're made of stronger stuff than that, aren't you, Kamina?
-2-male_removed_minor,target:pit,targetStage:3,direction:down=surprise,Oh, no, Pit. Nothing at all. Only master warriors tend to wear white, since they can avoid getting dirt or blood on it. Impressive.
-2-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1,direction:down=smirk,I imagine the two of you would get along well!

-1-male_removed_minor,target:pit,targetStage:3,direction:down=surprise,Oh, no, Pit. Nothing at all. Only master warriors tend to wear white, since they can avoid getting dirt or blood on it. Impressive.
-1-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1,direction:down=smirk,I imagine the two of you would get along well!
-1-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:2,direction:down=dishonor,Are you certain you don't know any of these people? Hm. I suppose the world is a large enough place...
-1-female_removing_minor,direction:down=interested,A bit late, don’t you think?
-1-female_removing_minor,direction:down=interested,Well…
-1-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,count-jasmine:1,direction:down=joy,I <i>was</i> curious about what that gem was. It reminds me of Princess Jasmine's, in some of her outfits.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:aella,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,I’ve got a lot of respect for a woman who’s willing to go out into the world and fight for a cause she respects and people she loves.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Oh, your gloves? I... tend to like wrists.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,Of <i>course</i> you can't sit out the next few rounds, Catria.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:catria,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,You know, I <i>do</i> have quite a lot of experience with armor, Catria. If you want help...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1,direction:down=surprise,Are you sure you aren't a princess, Elizabeth? You're awfully coy...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:5,direction:down=joy,Don't worry, Elizabeth. A lady needs nice legs. I feel like my legs are suitable for a soldier.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:haru,targetStage:1,direction:down=smirk,Your outit and demeanor are of one accustomed to authority and kindness... but not free from hardship.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:haru,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,Everything about you seems so fluffy and comfortable! I sense a great calm about you. You must be quite a source of strength for your allies.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:jasmine,targetStage:0,direction:down=chuckle,♩ Don't be so shy-- ♩
-1-female_removing_minor,target:juri,targetStage:1,direction:down=peace,It's obvious you're quite a skilled warrior... but why not be honorable?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:larachel,targetStage:0,direction:down=chuckle,I <i>see</i>. One of those <i>Western</i> priestly women. I'm sure whatever you do in your convents is <i>totally</i> holy.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:larachel,targetStage:2,direction:down=dishonor,Your boots are nice and all that... but how do you get your hair looking so pretty? Just the perk of being a princess, or...?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:larachel,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,I have a question... do you usually have an attendent help you out with this? I never... had an adjutant for that or anything but...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:2,direction:down=dishonor,I'm surprised you gave up your wand so quickly, Lotte.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:mae,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,I see you've had a hard time finding somewhere to belong, haven't you?
-1-female_removing_minor,target:mae,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:nightmarefeet,targetSayingMarker:nightmarefeet2,direction:down=chuckle,I don't suppose we have much of a choice... regular or nightmare feet, that is. <i>Trust me,</i> I've seen nightmare feet of <i>many</i> varieties.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1,direction:down=surprise,Oh. Of course, taking off armor is quite the challenge for men and women.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:miko,targetStage:0,direction:down=yikes,<i>Ai-yah!</i> A spirit?! You truly must be a powerful Taoist magician indeed!
-1-female_removing_minor,target:raven,targetStage:0,direction:down=denial,You're treating it like no big deal!
-1-female_removing_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,Most of the Princesses I know who use magic don't use it to show off...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:1,direction:down=joy,I <i>was</i> curious about what that gem was. It reminds me of... attire a woman I knew wore.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:0,direction:down=chuckle,You are <i>such</i> a sweet one, Sayori.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1,direction:down=peace,I see woman everywhere like lots of layers... I'm surprised your outfit is so... drab.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:2,direction:down=dishonor,I suppose if you're here to bond with someone, you would want to be fast about it...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:2,direction:down=smirk,I'm a fan of the sash, and your outfit. Loose, flowing clothes are <i>so</i> much better than heavy armor...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:syrenne,targetStage:2,direction:down=surprise,Oh... that's... an old superstition. I didn't mean to imply...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:syrenne,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,I see. I see also your... what are those? They're very... I haven't seen a piece of armor like <i>those</i> before.
-1-female_removing_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0,direction:down=smirk,Purple hair, a matching outfit…
-1-female_removed_minor,direction:down=joy,~Clothing~ is nice, but…
-1-female_removed_minor,direction:down=surprise,I just gave you a nice secret reveal, and showed you how I get down to business. Surely, you can take off something else?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:aella,targetStage:3,direction:down=challenge,I find it… relatable.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,direction:down=yikes,I have a vague worry that you’re going to hit someone by the end of this… and that’s not really in good taste…
-1-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,direction:down=yikes,I’ve blown up a cannon on myself before, but nothing like this…
-1-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,direction:down=denial,This can’t actually be that dangerous, can it?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2,direction:down=denial,They're very useful, if you know how to use them! They say a lot about a person. Catria's very strong, but also delicate. These are good traits in a woman. So I hear.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:2,direction:down=surprise,Oh. I'm sorry if I was staring. You can just tell a lot about someone by their wrists.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:3,direction:down=smirk,Oh? <i>Furs</i>? Now, I'm not a stranger to army humor. I know <i>exactly</i> what you mean, Catria. I guess we'll see <i>your</i> fur in a few hands.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:4,direction:down=denial,You know, I always figure you have to be smaller than your armor... but your chest is... it's dangerous to have oversized equipment. Trust me on this.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,Well, if you <i>aren't</i> a princess, I suppose you wouldn't mind <i>getting to know</i> a commoner like me, right?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2,totalMales:0,direction:down=surprise,Oh! Yes. Absolutely no lecherous thoughts, Elizabeth. None. Whatsoever.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:haru,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,In another world, you would've been a great princess. Thought, doubtless, you're quite skilled in what you do.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:haru,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,I'm... a little surprised by your lack of optimism, Miss Haru. I've certainly enjoyed the last few hands together.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:jasmine,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,<i>Haha,</i> take a joke, Miss.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:juri,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,Keeping your composure is important, but, really, why not consider fighting for justice rather than evil?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:larachel,targetStage:1,direction:down=smirk,Well, I admire your courage for attending to your friend in a game like this.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:larachel,targetStage:3,direction:down=chuckle,I have a feeling the princess spends a little more time on her appearance than her prayers... such a vibrant shade of green, too!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:larachel,targetStage:4,direction:down=smirk,I'm just surprised ~player~ isn't helping you get naked.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:3,direction:down=peace,I'm happy you're having fun, but surely a little magic would've helped your odds...?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:mae,targetStage:2,direction:down=joy,I'm sure you'll find a place where, when you look in the mirror, you can see the you you want to be staring back, Mae.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2,direction:down=joy,I'm actually quite fascinated. I would be interested to see how your quartermaster prepares equipment like that.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:miko,targetStage:1,direction:down=surprise,W-who is this, Crown Prince?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1,direction:down=peace,Okay, be that way.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:remilia,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,I suppose it almost makes up for your lack of <i>actual</i> nobility and honor.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,It's <i>interesting</i>  how you can have such a forward personality, but dress so femininely.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1,direction:down=smirk,I think putting your clothes back on is cheating... but I'm sure ~player~ could keep you warm.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:2,direction:down=joy,Your eyes, ribbons, and hair are so exotic! I'm surprised you dress in such earthy tones, Sayori.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:3,direction:down=chuckle,It must be nice to be so carefree, Sayori.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sheena,targetStage:3,direction:down=chuckle,...for women and warrior-poets, anyway.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:syrenne,targetStage:3,direction:down=peace,Well. Best to be continuing. Should I buy you a drink, Syrenne? Excuse my... poor choice of words.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:syrenne,targetStage:4,direction:down=denial,They don't look like any pants I've ever seen. I'm no princess, but I'm not some country girl-- person-- soldier-- either!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,I have... somewhat of an interest in wrists. They say so much about strength.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:zizou,targetStage:5,direction:down=yikes,I think feet can be... interesting. But I don't think they're as attractive.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,Are you a Princess of some sort? You certainly carry yourself like one, I bet.




#OPPONENT REMOVING MAJOR CLOTHING
#Major clothing reveals a significant amount of skin and likely underwear.
#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written
male_removing_major,direction:down=challenge,I hope it was worth it, ~name~!
male_removing_major,direction:down=challenge,Sloppy play, ~name~.
male_removed_major,direction:down=interested,It's important to enjoy the little things in life. But I think it's worth savoring the big ones too. Like your ~clothing~, ~name~.
male_removed_major,direction:down=interested,I'm just impressed you can keep pace with me. Any other contests you think you want me to beat you at?
male_removed_major,direction:down=joy,Don't worry, ~name~, I'm sure some nice woman will make a great househusband of you yet.
female_removing_major,direction:down=challenge,Now <i>~name~</i> is a woman worth fighting for.
female_removing_major,direction:down=interested,All’s fair in poker and war, ~name~.
female_removing_major,direction:down=surprise,So, ~name~... are you at all interested in women? A friend wants to know.
female_removed_major,direction:down=yikes,Sorry you had to lose, but sometimes you just got to go for the throat! Even--especially--in friendly games of chance!
female_removed_major,direction:down=surprise,Like a lotus blossom. Soft, and refined!
female_removed_major,direction:down=interested,Let's keep this up! It's so fun to gamble with other women.

0-male_removing_major,direction:down=joy,Makes sense, big strong guy like ~name~, making big strong plays like his ~clothing~!
0-male_removing_major,direction:down=dishonor,If I were in your ~clothing~, I’d have taken off two by now.
0-male_removing_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:4,direction:down=peace,Though, I’ll admit <i>I’m</i> usually the one asked for advice on underwear… by men like you.
0-male_removing_major,target:jin,targetStage:5,direction:down=chuckle,You say that like you haven't been waiting for it.

0-male_removing_major,target:kamina,targetStage:3,direction:down=smirk,I'd be offended if you started giving up the fight <i>now</i>.
0-male_removed_major,direction:down=yikes,See, have a little courage, like ~name~. Taking off ~clothing~ in a game like this is obviously the right play. You know, for the rest of us, eh?
0-male_removed_major,direction:down=challenge,Oh, just your ~clothing~? Well when it’s my turn, I’d take-- uh, I’d take off something even bigger.
0-male_removed_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:5,direction:down=smirk,It’s nice to be able to ask a man about lacy, feminine things without having a grunt or overt response.
0-male_removed_major,target:jin,targetStage:6,direction:down=smirk,I'll be honest, I was expecting a bit more decorum, Jin.
0-male_removed_major,target:jotaro,targetStage:6,direction:down=surprise,20,000 of anything sounds really expensive. You're quite the sharp dresser.
0-male_removed_major,target:kamina,targetStage:4,direction:down=joy,Ha! Well said. And... impressive. The speech, and...
0-male_removed_major,target:kamina,targetStage:7,direction:down=challenge,Though I'm not sure who'd find it more <i>arousing</i> than just inspiring.
0-female_removing_major,direction:down=surprise,Your ~clothing~ was gorgeous, ~name~... uh, what I mean to say is...
0-female_removing_major,direction:down=chuckle,Fa Ping is one of the most versatile soldiers you’ll meet! I can compliment ~name~ on her ~clothing~ and enjoy whatever she had beneath it.
0-female_removing_major,direction:down=challenge,I admire a woman who can keep a brave face, even during something challenging…
0-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0,direction:down=surprise,Get to shelter! Quickly!
0-female_removing_major,target:catria,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,That underwear is quite fascinating. From behind, it looks like you're wearing nothing at all...
0-female_removing_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,This is <i>far</i> more fun if I consider you a princess with a castle in the sky, Elizabeth.
0-female_removing_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2,totalMales:0,direction:down=chuckle,Uh... I'm right here, Elizabeth. Not that you should be embarassed I'm a lad-- a lad! A gentleman, though.
0-female_removing_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,You know, you did show us your panties when you lifted your skirt the first round, Elizabeth...
0-female_removing_major,target:haru,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,(<i>She's some sort of princess. I know it!</i>)
0-female_removing_major,target:haru,targetStage:4,direction:down=challenge,(<i>Just like that.</i>)
0-female_removing_major,target:ini,targetStage:2,direction:down=yikes,There's something off about Ini... besides the obvious...
0-female_removing_major,target:ini,targetStage:3,direction:down=dishonor,Hmm...
0-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1,direction:down=peace,And, with appropriate decorum, I present…
0-female_removing_major,target:juri,targetStage:0,direction:down=yikes,I admire a woman who can be so... direct. But there's really no hurry...
0-female_removing_major,target:larachel,targetStage:4,direction:down=yikes,I... would hate to ignore your requests, but... it's hard to look away from such a magnificent beauty.
0-female_removing_major,target:lotte,targetStage:3,direction:down=smirk,It's the wicked ones that tend to uh, go commando.
0-female_removing_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Fanfic? Is that type of spell, Lotte?
0-female_removing_major,target:mae,targetStage:3,direction:down=chuckle,You're <i>quite</i> the charmer.
0-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1,direction:down=yikes,My eyes--
0-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,Now, <i>I</i> don't mind a woman that's so forward.
0-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,direction:down=chuckle,I think Sei and I could teach you a lot about men.
0-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,So, you and your consort... I suppose you're used to this. I can't say I'm used to being undressed by someone else.
0-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5,direction:down=interested,I just realized your consort is undressing at the same rate you are. Does this imply that for the forfeit, you two will be...?
0-female_removing_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:3,direction:down=peace,Having composure and resolve is extremely important.
0-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:0,direction:down=surprise,Come to think of it, I don't think I've seen Mushu wear clothes...
0-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess,direction:down=yikes,Most of the spirits I know are ancestors, or guides…
0-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:null_possess,direction:down=joy,You’re certainly a princess, but I’ve met many princesses with different hair, skin, accents…
0-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:0,direction:down=surprise,Ah. One of the... more temperate ones, clearly.
0-female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,Hm. I guess we'll see what you really look like...
0-female_removing_major,target:remilia,targetStage:2,direction:down=denial,Without dignity, there's no true nobility. I think you should remember that, Remilia.
0-female_removing_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=peace,Sakuya, was it? Perhaps you should take Remilia home before she embarasses herself further.
0-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,direction:down=yikes,You'd notice if you could feel the wind against your heavenly gates, couldn't you?
0-female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:3,direction:down=yikes,Couldn't you consider either of your ribbons?
0-female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:4,direction:down=chuckle,If it makes you feel any better, <i>I</i> never was able to muster up the confidence you have.
0-female_removing_major,target:sheena,targetStage:3,direction:down=denial,Your brassiere is right there, Sheena. I thought... you wanted it to be visible?
0-female_removing_major,target:syrenne,targetStage:0,direction:down=surprise,Ai-yah? Someone's in a hurry tonight!
0-female_removing_major,target:syrenne,targetStage:4,direction:down=dishonor,It's less fun when your competition is trying to lose...
0-female_removing_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0,direction:down=chuckle,Oh, you have an alias too. I see.
0-female_removing_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,Though your pants also look <i>quite</i> comfortable.
0-female_removing_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,And you sing too, I’d wager? That's the truth, isn't it?
0-female_removed_major,direction:down=joy,What kind of virile man wouldn’t want to see someone like ~name~ take off her ~clothing~?
0-female_removed_major,direction:down=interested,Don’t be shy, ~name~! I’m-I’m sure there are worse secrets to keep than that.
0-female_removed_major,direction:down=interested,~name~ looks fantastic. Especially without her ~clothing~. Uh, don’t worry, ~name~, I can definitely keep you safe from invaders. Both of the horde and personal space types.
0-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4,count-akko:0,direction:down=yikes,This Akko person seems... rather intrusive.
0-female_removed_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1,count-twilight:0,direction:down=peace,Twilight... Hm... that name seems familiar...
0-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1,direction:down=dishonor,Is it really reasonable for you to fire that indoors?
0-female_removed_major,target:catria,targetStage:5,direction:down=surprise,O-oh. I see. You didn't know. Suffice to say, you have a wonderful... butt.
0-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3,direction:down=denial,I'd say you're far more than <i>half</i> decent, Elizabeth! Modesty is quite the virtue for you, isn't it?
0-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3,totalFemales:5,direction:down=surprise,W-what? Where'd Elizabeth go?
0-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:5,direction:down=smirk,And white underwear seems very pure. Are you <i>sure</i> you're not a princess?
0-female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:4,direction:down=smirk,One <i>final</i> question... do you have some sort of charming animal companion, Haru?
0-female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:5,targetSayingMarker:mommyharu,id:1,direction:down=smirk,(<i>There's great honor in poise.</i>)
0-female_removed_major,target:ini,targetStage:3,direction:down=denial,Surely, you aren't... this foolish, are you, Ini?
0-female_removed_major,target:ini,targetStage:4,direction:down=chuckle,I wonder if Ini is just <i>pretending</i> to be this stupid.
0-female_removed_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,Uh, yeah! Sure was the best disguise here, right, everyone?
0-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,Bring it on, then.
0-female_removed_major,target:larachel,targetStage:5,direction:down=peace,Like a statue. Have you considered letting the sculptors of your kingdom take example from you, L'Arachel?
0-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:akko,direction:down=dishonor,Is that true, Akko? That's quite indecent of you.
0-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:akko,direction:down=yikes,Atsuko, is this true? You have to be more polite about seeing people naked. I'm sure if you just <i>asked</i> her...
0-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:5,direction:down=challenge,I suppose it depends on the nature of the spell, but you seem trustworthy, so why not?
0-female_removed_major,target:mae,targetStage:3,direction:down=joy,There's nothing wrong with prioritizing comfort. It's important to be accepted as you are. You're among friends, Mae. At least one!
0-female_removed_major,target:mae,targetStage:4,direction:down=smirk,I just appreciate a person who makes the rules work for them, Mae.
0-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=surprise,Huh? Where did Ladybug go? I didn’t expect to need to deal with sorcery tonight…
0-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,direction:down=smirk,Fortunately, I don't mind a bit of forwardness. I would hope you're the same.
0-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei,direction:down=smirk,Like how they dress, what they like, and so on.
0-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:5,direction:down=surprise,Wait a minute. You aren't a Crown Prince at all! I can't believe I didn't see it Sooner!
0-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6,direction:down=challenge,Well, it seems only fair, given that you've been saving your energy. Of course, you'd need to lose twice more, Crown Prince.
0-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4,direction:down=joy,You bring honor to your friends for your sacrifices, Nagisa.
0-female_removed_major,target:navi,targetStage:1,direction:down=yikes,Phew. I suppose in a game like this, you'd need clothes. Obviously.
0-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess,direction:down=challenge,...But I didn’t come here to debate philosophy with ghosts… whatever you’re going to do, try to be gentle with Nayru.
0-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:null_possess,direction:down=chuckle,But never one with pointed ears or long blue hair. Sorry this is a late question, I’ve just been thinking how best to ask it.
0-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3,direction:down=surprise,<i>Ai-yah.</i> You're beautiful! Why try and hide away?
0-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=smirk,Reaching for the bottle? The mark of faltering courage, when not offered by friends.
0-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:4,direction:down=smirk,A truly noble soul is never at a loss for words. Your <i>real</i> class is showing, <i>Miss</i> Remilia.
0-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,direction:down=smirk,Or so I would assume.
0-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:4,direction:down=denial,I suppose your ribbon is quite pretty...
0-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:5,direction:down=joy,I know it's difficult... but as long as you do your best, even in defeat, there's honor!
0-female_removed_major,target:sheena,targetStage:4,direction:down=dishonor,...an assassin? That's disappointing...
0-female_removed_major,target:syrenne,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,That's only fair. People're seeing quite a lot of you, Syrenne.

1-male_removing_major,direction:down=joy,Makes sense, big strong guy like ~name~, making big strong plays like his ~clothing~!
1-male_removing_major,direction:down=dishonor,If I were in your ~clothing~, I’d have taken off two by now.
1-male_removing_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:4,direction:down=peace,Though, I’ll admit <i>I’m</i> usually the one asked for advice on underwear… by men like you.
1-male_removing_major,target:jin,targetStage:5,direction:down=chuckle,You say that like you haven't been waiting for it.
1-male_removing_major,target:jotaro,targetStage:5,direction:down=challenge,Glad to see you aren't a pushover, Jotaro.
1-male_removing_major,target:kamina,targetStage:3,direction:down=smirk,I'd be offended if you started giving up the fight <i>now</i>.
1-male_removed_major,direction:down=yikes,See, have a little courage, like ~name~. Taking off ~clothing~ in a game like this is obviously the right play. You know, for the rest of us, eh?
1-male_removed_major,direction:down=challenge,Oh, just your ~clothing~? Well when it’s my turn, I’d take-- uh, I’d take off something even bigger.
1-male_removed_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:5,direction:down=smirk,It’s nice to be able to ask a man about lacy, feminine things without having a grunt or overt response.
1-male_removed_major,target:jin,targetStage:6,direction:down=smirk,I'll be honest, I was expecting a bit more decorum, Jin.
1-male_removed_major,target:jotaro,targetStage:6,direction:down=surprise,20,000 of anything sounds really expensive. You're quite the sharp dresser.
1-male_removed_major,target:kamina,targetStage:4,direction:down=joy,Ha! Well said. And... impressive. The speech, and...
1-male_removed_major,target:kamina,targetStage:7,direction:down=challenge,Though I'm not sure who'd find it more <i>arousing</i> than just inspiring.
1-female_removing_major,direction:down=interested,It’s wonderful to come from a land that respects honor and strength… regardless of one’s state of birth.
1-female_removing_major,direction:down=surprise,Your ~clothing~ was gorgeous, ~name~... uh, what I mean to say is...
1-female_removing_major,direction:down=chuckle,Fa Ping is one of the most versatile soldiers you’ll meet! I can compliment ~name~ on her ~clothing~ and enjoy whatever she had beneath it.
1-female_removing_major,direction:down=challenge,I admire a woman who can keep a brave face, even during something challenging…
1-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0,direction:down=surprise,Get to shelter! Quickly!
1-female_removing_major,target:catria,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,That underwear is quite fascinating. From behind, it looks like you're wearing nothing at all...
1-female_removing_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,This is <i>far</i> more fun if I consider you a princess with a castle in the sky, Elizabeth.
1-female_removing_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2,totalMales:0,direction:down=chuckle,Uh... I'm right here, Elizabeth. Not that you should be embarassed I'm a lad-- a lad! A gentleman, though.
1-female_removing_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,You know, you did show us your panties when you lifted your skirt the first round, Elizabeth...
1-female_removing_major,target:haru,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,(<i>She's some sort of princess. I know it!</i>)
1-female_removing_major,target:haru,targetStage:4,direction:down=challenge,(<i>Just like that.</i>)

1-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1,direction:down=peace,And, with appropriate decorum, I present…
1-female_removing_major,target:juri,targetStage:0,direction:down=yikes,I admire a woman who can be so... direct. But there's really no hurry...
1-female_removing_major,target:larachel,targetStage:4,direction:down=yikes,I... would hate to ignore your requests, but... it's hard to look away from such a magnificent beauty.
1-female_removing_major,target:lotte,targetStage:3,direction:down=smirk,It's the wicked ones that tend to uh, go commando.
1-female_removing_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Fanfic? Is that type of spell, Lotte?
1-female_removing_major,target:mae,targetStage:3,direction:down=chuckle,You're <i>quite</i> the charmer.

1-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,Now, <i>I</i> don't mind a woman that's so forward.
1-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,direction:down=chuckle,I think Sei and I could teach you a lot about men.
1-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,So, you and your consort... I suppose you're used to this. I can't say I'm used to being undressed by someone else.
1-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5,direction:down=interested,I just realized your consort is undressing at the same rate you are. Does this imply that for the forfeit, you two will be...?
1-female_removing_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:3,direction:down=peace,Having composure and resolve is extremely important.
1-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:0,direction:down=surprise,Come to think of it, I don't think I've seen Mushu wear clothes...
1-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess,direction:down=yikes,Most of the spirits I know are ancestors, or guides…
1-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:null_possess,direction:down=joy,You’re certainly a princess, but I’ve met many princesses with different hair, skin, accents…
1-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:0,direction:down=surprise,Ah. One of the... more temperate ones, clearly.
1-female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,Hm. I guess we'll see what you really look like...
1-female_removing_major,target:remilia,targetStage:2,direction:down=denial,Without dignity, there's no true nobility. I think you should remember that, Remilia.
1-female_removing_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=peace,Sakuya, was it? Perhaps you should take Remilia home before she embarasses herself further.
1-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,direction:down=yikes,You'd notice if you could feel the wind against your heavenly gates, couldn't you?
1-female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:3,direction:down=yikes,Couldn't you consider either of your ribbons?
1-female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:4,direction:down=chuckle,If it makes you feel any better, <i>I</i> never was able to muster up the confidence you have.
1-female_removing_major,target:sheena,targetStage:3,direction:down=denial,Your brassiere is right there, Sheena. I thought... you wanted it to be visible?
1-female_removing_major,target:syrenne,targetStage:0,direction:down=surprise,Ai-yah? Someone's in a hurry tonight!
1-female_removing_major,target:syrenne,targetStage:4,direction:down=dishonor,It's less fun when your competition is trying to lose...
1-female_removing_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0,direction:down=chuckle,Oh, you have an alias too. I see.
1-female_removing_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,Though your pants also look <i>quite</i> comfortable.
1-female_removing_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,And you sing too, I’d wager? That's the truth, isn't it?
1-female_removed_major,direction:down=joy,What kind of virile man wouldn’t want to see someone like ~name~ take off her ~clothing~?
1-female_removed_major,direction:down=interested,Don’t be shy, ~name~! I’m-I’m sure there are worse secrets to keep than that.
1-female_removed_major,direction:down=interested,~name~ looks fantastic. Especially without her ~clothing~. Uh, don’t worry, ~name~, I can definitely keep you safe from invaders. Both of the horde and personal space types.
1-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4,count-akko:0,direction:down=yikes,This Akko person seems... rather intrusive.
1-female_removed_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1,count-twilight:0,direction:down=peace,Twilight... Hm... that name seems familiar...
1-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1,direction:down=dishonor,Is it really reasonable for you to fire that indoors?
1-female_removed_major,target:catria,targetStage:5,direction:down=surprise,O-oh. I see. You didn't know. Suffice to say, you have a wonderful... butt.
1-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3,direction:down=denial,I'd say you're far more than <i>half</i> decent, Elizabeth! Modesty is quite the virtue for you, isn't it?
1-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3,totalFemales:5,direction:down=surprise,W-what? Where'd Elizabeth go?
1-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:5,direction:down=smirk,And white underwear seems very pure. Are you <i>sure</i> you're not a princess?
1-female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:4,direction:down=smirk,One <i>final</i> question... do you have some sort of charming animal companion, Haru?
1-female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:5,targetSayingMarker:mommyharu,id:1,direction:down=smirk,(<i>There's great honor in poise.</i>)
1-female_removed_major,target:ini,targetStage:3,direction:down=denial,Surely, you aren't... this foolish, are you, Ini?
1-female_removed_major,target:ini,targetStage:4,direction:down=chuckle,I wonder if Ini is just <i>pretending</i> to be this stupid.
1-female_removed_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,Uh, yeah! Sure was the best disguise here, right, everyone?
1-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,Bring it on, then.
1-female_removed_major,target:larachel,targetStage:5,direction:down=peace,Like a statue. Have you considered letting the sculptors of your kingdom take example from you, L'Arachel?
1-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:akko,direction:down=dishonor,Is that true, Akko? That's quite indecent of you.
1-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:akko,direction:down=yikes,Atsuko, is this true? You have to be more polite about seeing people naked. I'm sure if you just <i>asked</i> her...
1-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:5,direction:down=challenge,I suppose it depends on the nature of the spell, but you seem trustworthy, so why not?
1-female_removed_major,target:mae,targetStage:3,direction:down=joy,There's nothing wrong with prioritizing comfort. It's important to be accepted as you are. You're among friends, Mae. At least one!
1-female_removed_major,target:mae,targetStage:4,direction:down=smirk,I just appreciate a person who makes the rules work for them, Mae.
1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=surprise,Huh? Where did Ladybug go? I didn’t expect to need to deal with sorcery tonight…
1-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,direction:down=smirk,Fortunately, I don't mind a bit of forwardness. I would hope you're the same.
1-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei,direction:down=smirk,Like how they dress, what they like, and so on.
1-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:5,direction:down=surprise,Wait a minute. You aren't a Crown Prince at all! I can't believe I didn't see it Sooner!
1-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6,direction:down=challenge,Well, it seems only fair, given that you've been saving your energy. Of course, you'd need to lose twice more, Crown Prince.
1-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4,direction:down=joy,You bring honor to your friends for your sacrifices, Nagisa.
1-female_removed_major,target:navi,targetStage:1,direction:down=yikes,Phew. I suppose in a game like this, you'd need clothes. Obviously.
1-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess,direction:down=challenge,...But I didn’t come here to debate philosophy with ghosts… whatever you’re going to do, try to be gentle with Nayru.
1-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:null_possess,direction:down=chuckle,But never one with pointed ears or long blue hair. Sorry this is a late question, I’ve just been thinking how best to ask it.
1-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3,direction:down=surprise,<i>Ai-yah.</i> You're beautiful! Why try and hide away?
1-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=smirk,Reaching for the bottle? The mark of faltering courage, when not offered by friends.
1-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:4,direction:down=smirk,A truly noble soul is never at a loss for words. Your <i>real</i> class is showing, <i>Miss</i> Remilia.
1-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,direction:down=smirk,Or so I would assume.
1-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:4,direction:down=denial,I suppose your ribbon is quite pretty...
1-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:5,direction:down=joy,I know it's difficult... but as long as you do your best, even in defeat, there's honor!
1-female_removed_major,target:sheena,targetStage:4,direction:down=dishonor,...an assassin? That's disappointing...
1-female_removed_major,target:syrenne,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,That's only fair. People're seeing quite a lot of you, Syrenne.
1-female_removed_major,target:syrenne,targetStage:5,direction:down=chuckle,You say that like it's a mark of honor. It's an... interesting thing to take pride in.
1-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,direction:down=denial,I mean, you have an alias! Nevermind. Let's focus on fitness, I suppose.
1-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:2,direction:down=smirk,Though, I think I'd look good in your pants.

2-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:4,direction:down=denial,I suppose your ribbon is quite pretty...
2-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:5,direction:down=joy,I know it's difficult... but as long as you do your best, even in defeat, there's honor!
2-female_removed_major,target:sheena,targetStage:4,direction:down=dishonor,...an assassin? That's disappointing...
2-female_removed_major,target:syrenne,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,That's only fair. People're seeing quite a lot of you, Syrenne.
2-female_removed_major,target:syrenne,targetStage:5,direction:down=chuckle,You say that like it's a mark of honor. It's an... interesting thing to take pride in.

3-male_removing_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:4,direction:down=peace,Though, I’ll admit <i>I’m</i> usually the one asked for advice on underwear… by men like you.
3-male_removing_major,target:jin,targetStage:5,direction:down=chuckle,You say that like you haven't been waiting for it.
3-male_removing_major,target:jotaro,targetStage:5,direction:down=challenge,Glad to see you aren't a pushover, Jotaro.
3-male_removing_major,target:kamina,targetStage:3,direction:down=smirk,I'd be offended if you started giving up the fight <i>now</i>.
3-male_removed_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:5,direction:down=smirk,It’s nice to be able to ask a man about lacy, feminine things without having a grunt or overt response.
3-male_removed_major,target:jin,targetStage:6,direction:down=smirk,I'll be honest, I was expecting a bit more decorum, Jin.
3-male_removed_major,target:jotaro,targetStage:6,direction:down=surprise,20,000 of anything sounds really expensive. You're quite the sharp dresser.
3-male_removed_major,target:kamina,targetStage:4,direction:down=joy,Ha! Well said. And... impressive. The speech, and...
3-male_removed_major,target:kamina,targetStage:7,direction:down=challenge,Though I'm not sure who'd find it more <i>arousing</i> than just inspiring.
3-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0,direction:down=surprise,Get to shelter! Quickly!
3-female_removing_major,target:catria,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,That underwear is quite fascinating. From behind, it looks like you're wearing nothing at all...
3-female_removing_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,This is <i>far</i> more fun if I consider you a princess with a castle in the sky, Elizabeth.
3-female_removing_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,You know, you did show us your panties when you lifted your skirt the first round, Elizabeth...
3-female_removing_major,target:haru,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,(<i>She's some sort of princess. I know it!</i>)
3-female_removing_major,target:haru,targetStage:4,direction:down=challenge,(<i>Just like that.</i>)

3-female_removing_major,target:ini,targetStage:3,direction:down=dishonor,Hmm...
3-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1,direction:down=peace,And, with appropriate decorum, I present…
3-female_removing_major,target:juri,targetStage:0,direction:down=yikes,I admire a woman who can be so... direct. But there's really no hurry...
3-female_removing_major,target:larachel,targetStage:4,direction:down=yikes,I... would hate to ignore your requests, but... it's hard to look away from such a magnificent beauty.
3-female_removing_major,target:lotte,targetStage:3,direction:down=smirk,It's the wicked ones that tend to uh, go commando.
3-female_removing_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Fanfic? Is that type of spell, Lotte?
3-female_removing_major,target:mae,targetStage:3,direction:down=chuckle,You're <i>quite</i> the charmer.

3-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,So, you and your consort... I suppose you're used to this. I can't say I'm used to being undressed by someone else.
3-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5,direction:down=interested,I just realized your consort is undressing at the same rate you are. Does this imply that for the forfeit, you two will be...?
3-female_removing_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:3,direction:down=peace,Having composure and resolve is extremely important.
3-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:0,direction:down=surprise,Come to think of it, I don't think I've seen Mushu wear clothes...

3-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:null_possess,direction:down=joy,You’re certainly a princess, but I’ve met many princesses with different hair, skin, accents…
3-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:0,direction:down=smirk,Ariel's always trying to strip down to her swimwear... but she <i>is</i> a mermaid... what does that make you?

3-female_removing_major,target:remilia,targetStage:2,direction:down=denial,Without dignity, there's no true nobility. I think you should remember that, Remilia.
3-female_removing_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=peace,Sakuya, was it? Perhaps you should take Remilia home before she embarasses herself further.
3-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,direction:down=yikes,You'd notice if you could feel the wind against your heavenly gates, couldn't you?
3-female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:3,direction:down=yikes,Couldn't you consider either of your ribbons?
3-female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:4,direction:down=chuckle,If it makes you feel any better, <i>I</i> never was able to muster up the confidence you have.
3-female_removing_major,target:sheena,targetStage:3,direction:down=denial,Your brassiere is right there, Sheena. I thought... you wanted it to be visible?

3-female_removing_major,target:syrenne,targetStage:4,direction:down=dishonor,It's less fun when your competition is trying to lose...
3-female_removing_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0,direction:down=chuckle,Oh, you have an alias too. I see.
3-female_removing_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,Though your pants also look <i>quite</i> comfortable.
3-female_removing_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,And you sing too, I’d wager? That's the truth, isn't it?
3-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4,count-akko:0,direction:down=yikes,This Akko person seems... rather intrusive.
3-female_removed_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1,count-twilight:0,direction:down=joy,Twilight... Hm... that name seems familiar... Is she a princess? Pink stripe in her hair? All worlds can use more smart princesses, if you ask me.
3-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1,direction:down=dishonor,Is it really reasonable for you to fire that indoors?
3-female_removed_major,target:catria,targetStage:5,direction:down=surprise,O-oh. I see. You didn't know. Suffice to say, you have a wonderful... butt.
3-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3,direction:down=denial,I'd say you're far more than <i>half</i> decent, Elizabeth! Modesty is quite the virtue for you, isn't it?
3-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3,totalFemales:5,direction:down=surprise,W-what? Where'd Elizabeth go?
3-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:5,direction:down=smirk,And white underwear seems very pure. Are you <i>sure</i> you're not a princess?
3-female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:4,direction:down=smirk,One <i>final</i> question... do you have some sort of charming animal companion, Haru?
3-female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:5,targetSayingMarker:mommyharu,id:1,direction:down=smirk,(<i>There's great honor in poise.</i>)
3-female_removed_major,target:ini,targetStage:3,direction:down=denial,Surely, you aren't... this foolish, are you, Ini?
3-female_removed_major,target:ini,targetStage:4,direction:down=chuckle,I wonder if Ini is just <i>pretending</i> to be this stupid.
3-female_removed_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:2,direction:down=denial,I thought mine worked better, Princess Jasmine.
3-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,Bring it on, then.
3-female_removed_major,target:larachel,targetStage:5,direction:down=peace,Like a statue. Have you considered letting the sculptors of your kingdom take example from you, L'Arachel?
3-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:akko,direction:down=dishonor,Is that true, Akko? That's quite indecent of you.
3-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:akko,direction:down=yikes,Atsuko, is this true? You have to be more polite about seeing people naked. I'm sure if you just <i>asked</i> her...
3-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:5,direction:down=challenge,I suppose it depends on the nature of the spell, but you seem trustworthy, so why not?
3-female_removed_major,target:mae,targetStage:3,direction:down=joy,There's nothing wrong with prioritizing comfort. It's important to be accepted as you are. You're among friends, Mae. At least one!
3-female_removed_major,target:mae,targetStage:4,direction:down=smirk,I just appreciate a person who makes the rules work for them, Mae.
3-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=surprise,Huh? Where did Ladybug go? I didn’t expect to need to deal with sorcery tonight…
3-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,direction:down=smirk,Fortunately, I don't mind a bit of forwardness. I would hope you're the same.
3-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei,direction:down=smirk,Like how they dress, what they like, and so on.
3-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:5,direction:down=surprise,Wait a minute. You aren't a Crown Prince at all! I can't believe I didn't see it Sooner!
3-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6,direction:down=challenge,Well, it seems only fair, given that you've been saving your energy. Of course, you'd need to lose twice more, Crown Prince.
3-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4,direction:down=joy,You bring honor to your friends for your sacrifices, Nagisa.
3-female_removed_major,target:navi,targetStage:1,direction:down=yikes,Phew. I suppose in a game like this, you'd need clothes. Obviously.
3-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess,direction:down=challenge,...But I didn’t come here to debate philosophy with ghosts… whatever you’re going to do, try to be gentle with Nayru.
3-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:null_possess,direction:down=chuckle,But never one with pointed ears or long blue hair. Sorry this is a late question, I’ve just been thinking how best to ask it.
3-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3,direction:down=surprise,<i>Ai-yah.</i> You're beautiful! Why try and hide away?
3-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=smirk,Reaching for the bottle? The mark of faltering courage, when not offered by friends.

#lost sword and vest
5-male_removing_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:4,direction:down=peace,Though, I’ll admit <i>I’m</i> usually the one asked for advice on underwear… by men like you.
5-male_removing_major,target:jin,targetStage:5,direction:down=chuckle,You say that like you haven't been waiting for it.
5-male_removing_major,target:jotaro,targetStage:5,direction:down=challenge,Glad to see you aren't a pushover, Jotaro.
5-male_removing_major,target:kamina,targetStage:3,direction:down=smirk,I'd be offended if you started giving up the fight <i>now</i>.
5-male_removed_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:5,direction:down=smirk,It’s nice to be able to ask a man about lacy, feminine things without having a grunt or overt response.
5-male_removed_major,target:jin,targetStage:6,direction:down=smirk,I'll be honest, I was expecting a bit more decorum, Jin.
5-male_removed_major,target:jotaro,targetStage:6,direction:down=surprise,20,000 of anything sounds really expensive. You're quite the sharp dresser.
5-male_removed_major,target:kamina,targetStage:4,direction:down=joy,Ha! Well said. And... impressive. The speech, and...
5-male_removed_major,target:kamina,targetStage:7,direction:down=challenge,Though I'm not sure who'd find it more <i>arousing</i> than just inspiring.
5-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0,direction:down=surprise,Get to shelter! Quickly!
5-female_removing_major,target:catria,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,That underwear is quite fascinating. From behind, it looks like you're wearing nothing at all...
5-female_removing_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,This is <i>far</i> more fun if I consider you a princess with a castle in the sky, Elizabeth.
5-female_removing_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,You know, you did show us your panties when you lifted your skirt the first round, Elizabeth...
5-female_removing_major,target:haru,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,(<i>She's some sort of princess. I know it!</i>)
5-female_removing_major,target:haru,targetStage:4,direction:down=challenge,(<i>Just like that.</i>)
5-female_removing_major,target:ini,targetStage:2,direction:down=yikes,There's something off about Ini... besides the obvious...
5-female_removing_major,target:ini,targetStage:3,direction:down=dishonor,Hmm...
5-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1,direction:down=peace,And, with appropriate decorum, I present…
5-female_removing_major,target:juri,targetStage:0,direction:down=yikes,I admire a woman who can be so... direct. But there's really no hurry...
5-female_removing_major,target:larachel,targetStage:4,direction:down=yikes,I... would hate to ignore your requests, but... it's hard to look away from such a magnificent beauty.
5-female_removing_major,target:lotte,targetStage:3,direction:down=smirk,It's the wicked ones that tend to uh, go commando.
5-female_removing_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Fanfic? Is that type of spell, Lotte?
5-female_removing_major,target:mae,targetStage:3,direction:down=chuckle,You're <i>quite</i> the charmer.

5-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,direction:down=chuckle,I think Sei and I could teach you a lot about men.
5-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,So, you and your consort... I suppose you're used to this. I can't say I'm used to being undressed by someone else.
5-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5,direction:down=interested,I just realized your consort is undressing at the same rate you are. Does this imply that for the forfeit, you two will be...?
5-female_removing_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:3,direction:down=peace,Having composure and resolve is extremely important.
5-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:0,direction:down=surprise,Come to think of it, I don't think I've seen Mushu wear clothes...
5-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess,direction:down=yikes,Most of the spirits I know are ancestors, or guides…
5-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:null_possess,direction:down=joy,You’re certainly a princess, but I’ve met many princesses with different hair, skin, accents…
5-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:0,direction:down=smirk,Ariel's always trying to strip down to her swimwear... but she <i>is</i> a mermaid... what does that make you?
5-female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,Hm. I guess we'll see what you really look like...
5-female_removing_major,target:remilia,targetStage:2,direction:down=denial,Without dignity, there's no true nobility. I think you should remember that, Remilia.
5-female_removing_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=peace,Sakuya, was it? Perhaps you should take Remilia home before she embarasses herself further.
5-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,direction:down=yikes,You'd notice if you could feel the wind against your heavenly gates, couldn't you?
5-female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:3,direction:down=yikes,Couldn't you consider either of your ribbons?
5-female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:4,direction:down=chuckle,If it makes you feel any better, <i>I</i> never was able to muster up the confidence you have.
5-female_removing_major,target:sheena,targetStage:3,direction:down=denial,Your brassiere is right there, Sheena. I thought... you wanted it to be visible?
5-female_removing_major,target:syrenne,targetStage:0,direction:down=surprise,Ai-yah? Someone's in a hurry tonight!
5-female_removing_major,target:syrenne,targetStage:4,direction:down=dishonor,It's less fun when your competition is trying to lose...
5-female_removing_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0,direction:down=chuckle,Oh, you have an alias too. I see.
5-female_removing_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,Though your pants also look <i>quite</i> comfortable.
5-female_removing_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,And you sing too, I’d wager? That's the truth, isn't it?
5-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4,count-akko:0,direction:down=yikes,This Akko person seems... rather intrusive.
5-female_removed_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1,count-twilight:0,direction:down=joy,Twilight... Hm... that name seems familiar... Is she a princess? Pink stripe in her hair? All worlds can use more smart princesses, if you ask me.
5-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1,direction:down=dishonor,Is it really reasonable for you to fire that indoors?
5-female_removed_major,target:catria,targetStage:5,direction:down=surprise,O-oh. I see. You didn't know. Suffice to say, you have a wonderful... butt.
5-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3,direction:down=denial,I'd say you're far more than <i>half</i> decent, Elizabeth! Modesty is quite the virtue for you, isn't it?
5-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3,totalFemales:5,direction:down=surprise,W-what? Where'd Elizabeth go?
5-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:5,direction:down=smirk,And white underwear seems very pure. Are you <i>sure</i> you're not a princess?
5-female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:4,direction:down=smirk,One <i>final</i> question... do you have some sort of charming animal companion, Haru?
5-female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:5,targetSayingMarker:mommyharu,id:1,direction:down=smirk,(<i>There's great honor in poise.</i>)
5-female_removed_major,target:ini,targetStage:3,direction:down=denial,Surely, you aren't... this foolish, are you, Ini?
5-female_removed_major,target:ini,targetStage:4,direction:down=chuckle,I wonder if Ini is just <i>pretending</i> to be this stupid.
5-female_removed_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:2,direction:down=denial,I thought mine worked better, Princess Jasmine.
5-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,Bring it on, then.
5-female_removed_major,target:larachel,targetStage:5,direction:down=peace,Like a statue. Have you considered letting the sculptors of your kingdom take example from you, L'Arachel?
5-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:akko,direction:down=dishonor,Is that true, Akko? That's quite indecent of you.
5-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:akko,direction:down=yikes,Atsuko, is this true? You have to be more polite about seeing people naked. I'm sure if you just <i>asked</i> her...
5-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:5,direction:down=challenge,I suppose it depends on the nature of the spell, but you seem trustworthy, so why not?
5-female_removed_major,target:mae,targetStage:3,direction:down=joy,There's nothing wrong with prioritizing comfort. It's important to be accepted as you are. You're among friends, Mae. At least one!
5-female_removed_major,target:mae,targetStage:4,direction:down=smirk,I just appreciate a person who makes the rules work for them, Mae.
5-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=surprise,Huh? Where did Ladybug go? I didn’t expect to need to deal with sorcery tonight…
5-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,direction:down=smirk,Fortunately, I don't mind a bit of forwardness. I would hope you're the same.
5-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei,direction:down=smirk,Like how they dress, what they like, and so on.
5-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:5,direction:down=surprise,Wait a minute. You aren't a Crown Prince at all! I can't believe I didn't see it Sooner!
5-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6,direction:down=challenge,Well, it seems only fair, given that you've been saving your energy. Of course, you'd need to lose twice more, Crown Prince.
5-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4,direction:down=joy,You bring honor to your friends for your sacrifices, Nagisa.
5-female_removed_major,target:navi,targetStage:1,direction:down=yikes,Phew. I suppose in a game like this, you'd need clothes. Obviously.
5-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess,direction:down=challenge,...But I didn’t come here to debate philosophy with ghosts… whatever you’re going to do, try to be gentle with Nayru.
5-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:null_possess,direction:down=chuckle,But never one with pointed ears or long blue hair. Sorry this is a late question, I’ve just been thinking how best to ask it.
5-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3,direction:down=surprise,<i>Ai-yah.</i> You're beautiful! Why try and hide away?
5-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=smirk,Reaching for the bottle? The mark of faltering courage, when not offered by friends.
5-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:4,direction:down=smirk,A truly noble soul is never at a loss for words. Your <i>real</i> class is showing, <i>Miss</i> Remilia.
5-female_removed_major,target:rinkah,targetStage:4,direction:down=smirk,Or so I would assume.
5-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:4,direction:down=denial,I suppose your ribbon is quite pretty...
5-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:5,direction:down=joy,I know it's difficult... but as long as you do your best, even in defeat, there's honor!
5-female_removed_major,target:sheena,targetStage:4,direction:down=dishonor,...an assassin? That's disappointing...
5-female_removed_major,target:syrenne,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,That's only fair. People're seeing quite a lot of you, Syrenne.
5-female_removed_major,target:syrenne,targetStage:5,direction:down=chuckle,You say that like it's a mark of honor. It's an... interesting thing to take pride in.

7-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:akko,direction:down=dishonor,Is that true, Akko? That's quite indecent of you.
7-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:akko,direction:down=yikes,Atsuko, is this true? You have to be more polite about seeing people naked. I'm sure if you just <i>asked</i> her...
7-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:5,direction:down=challenge,I suppose it depends on the nature of the spell, but you seem trustworthy, so why not?
7-female_removed_major,target:mae,targetStage:3,direction:down=joy,There's nothing wrong with prioritizing comfort. It's important to be accepted as you are. You're among friends, Mae. At least one!
7-female_removed_major,target:mae,targetStage:4,direction:down=smirk,I just appreciate a person who makes the rules work for them, Mae.
7-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=surprise,Huh? Where did Ladybug go? I didn’t expect to need to deal with sorcery tonight…
7-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,direction:down=smirk,Fortunately, I don't mind a bit of forwardness. I would hope you're the same.
7-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei,direction:down=smirk,Like how they dress, what they like, and so on.
7-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:5,direction:down=surprise,Wait a minute. You aren't a Crown Prince at all! I can't believe I didn't see it Sooner!
7-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6,direction:down=challenge,Well, it seems only fair, given that you've been saving your energy. Of course, you'd need to lose twice more, Crown Prince.
7-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4,direction:down=joy,You bring honor to your friends for your sacrifices, Nagisa.
7-female_removed_major,target:navi,targetStage:1,direction:down=yikes,Phew. I suppose in a game like this, you'd need clothes. Obviously.

#masturbating
-2-male_removing_major,direction:down=challenge,A-ah, exactly w-what I was hoping for!
-2-male_removing_major,direction:down=challenge,One might expect that I’d have grown tired of this after exposure… one may expect, but be wrong…
-2-male_removing_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:4,direction:down=peace,Though, I’ll admit <i>I’m</i> usually the one asked for advice on underwear… by men like you.
-2-male_removing_major,target:jin,targetStage:5,direction:down=chuckle,You say that like you haven't been waiting for it.
-2-male_removing_major,target:jotaro,targetStage:5,direction:down=challenge,Glad to see you aren't a pushover, Jotaro.
-2-male_removed_major,direction:down=joy,I’m… really liking what you’re showing off, ~name~.
-2-male_removed_major,target:corrin_m,targetStage:5,direction:down=smirk,It’s nice to be able to ask a man about lacy, feminine things without having a grunt or overt response.
-2-male_removed_major,target:jin,targetStage:6,direction:down=smirk,I'll be honest, I was expecting a bit more decorum, Jin.
-2-male_removed_major,target:jotaro,targetStage:6,direction:down=surprise,20,000 of anything sounds really expensive. You're quite the sharp dresser.
-2-male_removed_major,target:kamina,targetStage:7,direction:down=challenge,Though I'm not sure who'd find it more <i>arousing</i> than just inspiring.
-2-female_removing_major,direction:down=challenge,I-I’m much more used to undressing-- men undressing. You’re giving me… ah, an amount of inspiration, though, ~name~.
-2-female_removing_major,direction:down=challenge,A-ah, exactly w-what I was hoping for!
-2-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0,direction:down=surprise,Get to shelter! Quickly!
-2-female_removing_major,target:catria,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,That underwear is quite fascinating. From behind, it looks like you're wearing nothing at all...
-2-female_removing_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,This is <i>far</i> more fun if I consider you a princess with a castle in the sky, Elizabeth.
-2-female_removing_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,You know, you did show us your panties when you lifted your skirt the first round, Elizabeth...
-2-female_removing_major,target:haru,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,(<i>She's some sort of princess. I know it!</i>)
-2-female_removing_major,target:haru,targetStage:4,direction:down=challenge,(<i>Just like that.</i>)
-2-female_removing_major,target:ini,targetStage:2,direction:down=yikes,There's something off about Ini... besides the obvious...
-2-female_removing_major,target:ini,targetStage:3,direction:down=dishonor,Hmm...
-2-female_removing_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:1,direction:down=peace,And, with appropriate decorum, I present…
-2-female_removing_major,target:juri,targetStage:0,direction:down=yikes,I admire a woman who can be so... direct. But there's really no hurry...
-2-female_removing_major,target:larachel,targetStage:4,direction:down=yikes,I... would hate to ignore your requests, but... it's hard to look away from such a magnificent beauty.
-2-female_removing_major,target:lotte,targetStage:3,direction:down=smirk,It's the wicked ones that tend to uh, go commando.
-2-female_removing_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Fanfic? Is that type of spell, Lotte?
-2-female_removing_major,target:mae,targetStage:3,direction:down=chuckle,You're <i>quite</i> the charmer.

-2-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,direction:down=chuckle,Now, <i>I</i> don't mind a woman that's so forward.
-2-female_removing_major,target:meia,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:sei,direction:down=chuckle,I think Sei and I could teach you a lot about men.
-2-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,So, you and your consort... I suppose you're used to this. I can't say I'm used to being undressed by someone else.
-2-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5,direction:down=interested,I just realized your consort is undressing at the same rate you are. Does this imply that for the forfeit, you two will be...?
-2-female_removing_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:3,direction:down=peace,Having composure and resolve is extremely important.
-2-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:0,direction:down=surprise,Come to think of it, I don't think I've seen Mushu wear clothes...
-2-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess,direction:down=yikes,Most of the spirits I know are ancestors, or guides…
-2-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:null_possess,direction:down=joy,You’re certainly a princess, but I’ve met many princesses with different hair, skin, accents…
-2-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:0,direction:down=smirk,Ariel's always trying to strip down to her swimwear... but she <i>is</i> a mermaid... what does that make you?
-2-female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,Hm. I guess we'll see what you really look like...
-2-female_removing_major,target:remilia,targetStage:2,direction:down=denial,Without dignity, there's no true nobility. I think you should remember that, Remilia.
-2-female_removing_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3,direction:down=peace,Sakuya, was it? Perhaps you should take Remilia home before she embarasses herself further.
-2-female_removing_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,direction:down=yikes,You'd notice if you could feel the wind against your heavenly gates, couldn't you?
-2-female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:3,direction:down=yikes,Couldn't you consider either of your ribbons?
-2-female_removing_major,target:sayori,targetStage:4,direction:down=chuckle,If it makes you feel any better, <i>I</i> never was able to muster up the confidence you have.
-2-female_removing_major,target:sheena,targetStage:3,direction:down=denial,Your brassiere is right there, Sheena. I thought... you wanted it to be visible?
-2-female_removing_major,target:syrenne,targetStage:0,direction:down=surprise,Ai-yah? Someone's in a hurry tonight!
-2-female_removing_major,target:syrenne,targetStage:4,direction:down=dishonor,It's less fun when your competition is trying to lose...
-2-female_removing_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0,direction:down=chuckle,Oh, you have an alias too. I see.
-2-female_removing_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,Though your pants also look <i>quite</i> comfortable.
-2-female_removing_major,target:zone-tan,targetStage:1,direction:down=interested,And you sing too, I’d wager? That's the truth, isn't it?
-2-female_removed_major,direction:down=joy,Like poetry in the flesh... !
-2-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4,count-akko:0,direction:down=yikes,This Akko person seems... rather intrusive.
-2-female_removed_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1,count-twilight:0,direction:down=joy,Twilight... Hm... that name seems familiar... Is she a princess? Pink stripe in her hair? All worlds can use more smart princesses, if you ask me.
-2-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1,direction:down=dishonor,Is it really reasonable for you to fire that indoors?
-2-female_removed_major,target:catria,targetStage:5,direction:down=surprise,O-oh. I see. You didn't know. Suffice to say, you have a wonderful... butt.
-2-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3,direction:down=denial,I'd say you're far more than <i>half</i> decent, Elizabeth! Modesty is quite the virtue for you, isn't it?
-2-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3,totalFemales:5,direction:down=surprise,W-what? Where'd Elizabeth go?
-2-female_removed_major,target:elizabeth,targetStage:5,direction:down=smirk,And white underwear seems very pure. Are you <i>sure</i> you're not a princess?
-2-female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:4,direction:down=smirk,One <i>final</i> question... do you have some sort of charming animal companion, Haru?
-2-female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:5,targetSayingMarker:mommyharu,id:1,direction:down=smirk,(<i>There's great honor in poise.</i>)
-2-female_removed_major,target:ini,targetStage:3,direction:down=denial,Surely, you aren't... this foolish, are you, Ini?
-2-female_removed_major,target:ini,targetStage:4,direction:down=chuckle,I wonder if Ini is just <i>pretending</i> to be this stupid.
-2-female_removed_major,target:jasmine,targetStage:2,direction:down=denial,I thought mine worked better, Princess Jasmine.
-2-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1,direction:down=challenge,Bring it on, then.
-2-female_removed_major,target:larachel,targetStage:5,direction:down=peace,Like a statue. Have you considered letting the sculptors of your kingdom take example from you, L'Arachel?
-2-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:akko,direction:down=dishonor,Is that true, Akko? That's quite indecent of you.
-2-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:akko,direction:down=yikes,Atsuko, is this true? You have to be more polite about seeing people naked. I'm sure if you just <i>asked</i> her...
-2-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:5,direction:down=challenge,I suppose it depends on the nature of the spell, but you seem trustworthy, so why not?
-2-female_removed_major,target:mae,targetStage:3,direction:down=joy,There's nothing wrong with prioritizing comfort. It's important to be accepted as you are. You're among friends, Mae. At least one!
-2-female_removed_major,target:mae,targetStage:4,direction:down=smirk,I just appreciate a person who makes the rules work for them, Mae.
-2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,direction:down=surprise,Huh? Where did Ladybug go? I didn’t expect to need to deal with sorcery tonight…
-2-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,direction:down=smirk,Fortunately, I don't mind a bit of forwardness. I would hope you're the same.
-2-female_removed_major,target:meia,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei,direction:down=smirk,Like how they dress, what they like, and so on.
-2-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:5,direction:down=surprise,Wait a minute. You aren't a Crown Prince at all! I can't believe I didn't see it Sooner!
-2-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6,direction:down=challenge,Well, it seems only fair, given that you've been saving your energy. Of course, you'd need to lose twice more, Crown Prince.
-2-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4,direction:down=joy,You bring honor to your friends for your sacrifices, Nagisa.
-2-female_removed_major,target:navi,targetStage:1,direction:down=yikes,Phew. I suppose in a game like this, you'd need clothes. Obviously.
-2-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess,direction:down=challenge,...But I didn’t come here to debate philosophy with ghosts… whatever you’re going to do, try to be gentle with Nayru.
-2-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:null_possess,direction:down=chuckle,But never one with pointed ears or long blue hair. Sorry this is a late question, I’ve just been thinking how best to ask it.

0-female_large_chest_is_visible,direction:down=surprise,I bet your partner’s very pleased with your size, ~name~. I know I certainly would be. Hard to imagine a lady like you wouldn’t have her pick of the boys! Or girls. Girls are fine too, right?

1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:jin,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Well, at least you have a body to back up that confidence.
1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:jotaro,targetStage:4,direction:down=chuckle,I enjoy a man with some fight in him!
1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,This may sound like an excuse to look at your... rear...

1-male_chest_is_visible,direction:down=joy,Whoaaa… I’m impressed, ~name~. Man to man, you have to let me touch all that hard work.
1-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s,direction:down=surprise,...For a game that isn’t for children, it seems odd to censor a man’s nipples.
1-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m,direction:down=smirk,It’s impressive, in some ways. Refreshing to see such honesty, especially among nobles.
1-male_chest_is_visible,target:jin,targetStage:5,direction:down=surprise,I wasn't checking you out. It doesn't make up for your play so far. No way.
1-male_chest_is_visible,target:jotaro,targetStage:5,direction:down=smirk,Impressive, Jotaro. I'd like to see how you wrestle.
1-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit,targetStage:4,direction:down=surprise,But since your shirt's off, can I see how your wings attach?

1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:thong,marker:thong_mulan,direction:down=surprise,Oh my, how exotic. That… thong, is something a courtesan would wear… but a high class one.
1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:thong,marker:thong_mulan,direction:down=chuckle,Huh! I haven’t seen underwear like that before. It just shows off everything so <i>well</i>! I might have to invest in a pair of those before I head home.

1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:jin,targetStage:7,direction:down=interested,I suppose getting to see Fujin <i>and</i> this sword was far from the worst outcome.
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:jotaro,targetStage:7,direction:down=chuckle,Ai-yah! Here I was, worried you were overcompensating! I suppose you'd be right at home in the <i>Wang</i> dynasty.
1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:kamina,targetStage:6,direction:down=chuckle,Manly enough to appreciate the speech and passion, at least.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,direction:down=interested,Handle yourself with grace, ~name~, no matter what.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,direction:down=joy,I have to say, I wasn’t really expecting to see something so exciting so soon in the game. Don’t mind me if I’m a bit speechless…
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:catria,direction:down=smirk,Catria, you don't need to be embarrassed by your body. Not when you have a sizable <i>arse</i>nal...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ini,targetStage:4,direction:down=denial,It was an act!? I can't believe that fooled me!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:juri,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,So... vulgar...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mae,direction:down=interested,There's no shame in an honest lost, Mae. Besides, you're exceptionally beautiful.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:miko,direction:down=smirk,Of course <i>I</i> agree with you, Crown Prince.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:navi,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,Normally, I'm all about modesty. In this game, I suppose I should appreciate the unusual view?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,You couldn't get to your bra first, I suppose...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:remilia,targetStage:4,direction:down=challenge,I'll make my own destiny, thanks. And that means watching you lose!

1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:celsius,direction:down=surprise,No need to give us the cold shoulder...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:luna,direction:down=chuckle,Not quite the moon I wanted to see, Sheena, but your spirit guide is gorgeous!
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:shadow,direction:down=denial,...Imprisoning Sheena? All that I see?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:sylph,direction:down=joy,So many spirit guides! You must be on a quest of great importance... so great you forgot to wear underwear...?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:undine,direction:down=smirk,A more base person might accuse that fishy smell of coming from somewhere else...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Who is this great spirit you've invoked, Sheena?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:syrenne,direction:down=interested,And to think, if you hadn't have spilled your drink, this would've been completely different.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:4,direction:down=smirk,...you think I could support your chest with my hands? It might be a great workout for my hands...
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zizou,targetStage:5,direction:down=yikes,Revenge... magic?
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,direction:down=yikes,Though, I suppose that could change! The rules, like me, can be flexible, honestly!
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,direction:down=peace,I have to say, small breasts are underrated. Speaking from <i>intensive</i> experience, if they’re enough to fill your hand, they should be enough to fill your heart.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:catria,direction:down=chuckle,What I mean to say is that your <i>ass</i>ets lie elsewhere.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:lotte,targetStage:6,direction:down=interested,Oh, my apologies, Lotte. They're just quite pink! Bigger than mine, if that's consolation...
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:mae,targetSaying:fat,direction:down=interested,Oh... is that... a problem where you're from? A woman with curves is very desirable...  the cat ears... maybe less so.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:mae,targetSaying:weight,direction:down=interested,Oh... is that... a problem where you're from? A woman with curves is very desirable... the cat ears... maybe less so.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:miko,direction:down=interested,It... would allow one to pretend to being male, after all. Uh... yes. One's wife.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:navi,targetStage:2,direction:down=dishonor,(<i>Why do I always get the spirits that are a little... unusual...</i>)
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:remilia,targetStage:5,direction:down=joy,I'd wager destiny's working out for me.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:sayori,targetStage:6,direction:down=smirk,If you hold your nerve... I bet ~player~ would hold your hand... <i>(Or something else, if you'd prefer?</i>)
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:zizou,targetStage:6,direction:down=challenge,I would've liked you to have shown your best from the start... but let's see what you can do, Zizou!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,direction:down=joy,Now, I may be a soldier, but I <i>am</i> a gentle and honorable warrior too. I’ll say your chest is incredible, but I’d never solicit you for something untoward.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,direction:down=interested,Like twin moons in the sky, ~name~, yet somehow more dazzling.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:elizabeth,direction:down=chuckle,You have beautiful breasts, Elizabeth! I suppose they'd look even better in candlelight... alone... with just us...
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:ini,targetStage:5,direction:down=chuckle,After all, I, Ping, have no need of such deceptions.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:juri,targetStage:3,direction:down=yikes,If you're trying to seduce me to evil, it won't work! ...Right?

1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:4,direction:down=joy,And you're all about training, right?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan,direction:down=chuckle,<i>Hm.</i> You certainly are animated... Even down to, um, the tits.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,direction:down=surprise,I bet your partner’s very pleased with your size, ~name~. I know I certainly would be. Hard to imagine a lady like you wouldn’t have her pick of the boys! Or girls. Girls are fine too, right?
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,filter:huge_breasts,direction:down=surprise,Goodness! I was hoping those’d be real, but wow, ~name~, does the Emperor know you’re walking around with that kind of ordinance outside his concubine chambers?
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:sheena,targetStage:5,direction:down=challenge,There's clearly more to you than meets the eye. And there was already so much to enjoy!
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:syrenne,direction:down=challenge,Impressive, but... combat equipped? Perhaps not.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:syrenne,totalNaked:1,notSaidMarker:duel_lost,marker:syrenne_duel,direction:down=smirk,About our little duel, Syrenne, what's been your greatest feat of drinking? Or... really, any night at the tavern?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,direction:down=denial,I-I’m always curious to see how styles differ. Uh. Between the many women I’ve seen naked. Obviously.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,direction:down=interested,Well, ~name~, I wouldn’t worry too much. Everyone here looks like they’re going to appreciate whatever you’re about to show off. I know I will.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:thong,marker:thong_mulan,direction:down=surprise,Oh my, how exotic. That… thong, is something a courtesan would wear… but a high class one.

1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:catria,direction:down=joy,Oh, come now, Catria. Well, don't <i>come</i> yet...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elizabeth,direction:down=interested,In truth, the rumors you hear of the other Princesses aren't wholly accurate...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:haru,direction:down=yikes,...As long as you're truly comfortable, Haru.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ini,targetStage:5,direction:down=chuckle,Well, I guess now we'll see your true face!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,Ah, you must be from a world near the Land of Dragons... I see that women there are... afforded more freedom, perhaps.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:miko,direction:down=joy,I respect your conviction, Crown Prince. If I weren't loyal to my emperor, I would surely find myself in the host of your elite warriors.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:navi,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,Hm. I've heard of some women covering themselves in flowers...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:palutena,direction:down=surprise,Well, Mushu is always nude. And Elsa has a bad habit about getting naked around Anna, and I don’t always think she’s quite human…
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,I guess we'll see...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:remilia,targetStage:5,direction:down=peace,Though, let's see how you look when you're alone and naked.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayori,targetStage:6,direction:down=interested,I was actually quite impressed with your underwear! It looks so comfortable... but...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetStage:5,direction:down=interested,...Go on...?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:syrenne,direction:down=dishonor,At least it didn't break... are you okay, Syrenne?

1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:2,direction:down=surprise,Oh. Nevermind then. I guess I should've trained more for this...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zizou,targetStage:6,direction:down=surprise,Surely, you're wearing underwear? Of some divine type?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zizou,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:5-8,direction:down=dishonor,Surely, unlike Futaba, you wore <i>some</i> kind of underwear?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,direction:down=smirk,I think you'd keep things very, very interesting, as a member of our society.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,direction:down=interested,O-oh. Very sexy. It’s kind of like my-- <i>many</i> of the ones I’ve seen before. You uh, are in kind of a hurry to get naked though, given I’m still… still in my armor.

1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee,saidMarker:challenge_answer,direction:down=denial,I have a vague worry that you’re going to hit someone by the end of this… and that’s not really in good taste…
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee,saidMarker:challenge_answer,direction:down=surprise,I’ve blown up a cannon on myself before, but nothing like this…
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee,saidMarker:challenge_answer,direction:down=yikes,This can’t actually be that dangerous, can it?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:catria,direction:down=surprise,Huh? Do all women in your division look like that?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:catria,alsoPlaying:meia,notSaidMarker:blue_hair_bare,marker:blue_hair_bare,direction:down=peace,Oh, I see. Women with blue hair don't have hair there, I suppose.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:catria,alsoPlaying:sei,notSaidMarker:blue_hair_bare,marker:blue_hair_bare,direction:down=peace,Oh, I see. Women with blue hair don't have hair there, I suppose.

1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri,targetStage:4,direction:down=challenge,You seem quite interested in ~Player~. But I might be as worthy of a challenge, eh, Juri?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:larachel,direction:down=smirk,I'm surprised that it matches, or that there's anything there at all. Curious.

1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,targetStage:4,direction:down=yikes,Y-you don't wear underwear. What a strange... choice.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:remilia,targetStage:6,direction:down=interested,I've won battles less attired... well, I do have hair... what an odd appearance.

-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,direction:down=interested,I’m more than happy to enjoy a woman’s company too, ~name~... what about you?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:thong,marker:thong_mulan,direction:down=surprise,Oh my, how exotic. That… thong, is something a courtesan would wear… but a high class one.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:thong,marker:thong_mulan,direction:down=chuckle,Huh! I haven’t seen underwear like that before. It just shows off everything so <i>well</i>! I might have to invest in a pair of those before I head home.

-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:jin,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Well, at least you have a body to back up that confidence.
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:jotaro,targetStage:4,direction:down=chuckle,I enjoy a man with some fight in him!
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,This may sound like an excuse to look at your... rear...
-2-male_chest_is_visible,direction:down=surprise,Ai-yah~! I don’t see any battlescars… maybe you could do with some scratches, if you were on the bottom?
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s,direction:down=surprise,...For a game that isn’t for children, it seems odd to censor a man’s nipples.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m,direction:down=smirk,It’s impressive, in some ways. Refreshing to see such honesty, especially among nobles.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:jin,targetStage:5,direction:down=surprise,I wasn't checking you out. It doesn't make up for your play so far. No way.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:jotaro,targetStage:5,direction:down=smirk,Impressive, Jotaro. I'd like to see how you wrestle.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit,targetStage:4,direction:down=surprise,But since your shirt's off, can I see how your wings attach?

-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,direction:down=interested,Enough foreplay, let’s see it!
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kamina,targetStage:5,count-coco:0,direction:down=smirk,It would be... a new challenge for me to appreciate. I think.

-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kamina,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:coco,alsoPlayingStage:7-10,direction:down=challenge,It would be... a new challenge for me to appreciate. I enjoyed Coco's version, but I think I'd like yours even more, Kamina.

-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,direction:down=challenge,It’s-- it’s big, but… I’ve always wanted to try…
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:jin,targetStage:7,direction:down=interested,I suppose getting to see Fujin <i>and</i> this sword was far from the worst outcome.
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:jotaro,targetStage:7,direction:down=chuckle,Ai-yah! Here I was, worried you were overcompensating! I suppose you'd be right at home in the <i>Wang</i> dynasty.
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:kamina,targetStage:6,direction:down=smirk,Impressive. I don't suppose I could give it a swing or two? I've never handled a <i>drill</i> like that.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,direction:down=interested,If I ask nicely, will you be quick about it?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5,direction:down=yikes,In war, deception can win many battles… but this seems a bit like overt disregard of the rules…
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:catria,direction:down=smirk,Catria, you don't need to be embarrassed by your body. Not when you have a sizable <i>arse</i>nal...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ini,targetStage:4,direction:down=denial,It was an act!? I can't believe that fooled me!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:juri,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,So... vulgar...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mae,direction:down=interested,There's no shame in an honest lost, Mae. Besides, you're exceptionally beautiful.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:miko,direction:down=smirk,Of course <i>I</i> agree with you, Crown Prince.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:navi,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,Normally, I'm all about modesty. In this game, I suppose I should appreciate the unusual view?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,You couldn't get to your bra first, I suppose...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:remilia,targetStage:4,direction:down=challenge,I'll make my own destiny, thanks. And that means watching you lose!

-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:shadow,direction:down=denial,...Imprisoning Sheena? All that I see?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:sylph,direction:down=joy,So many spirit guides! You must be on a quest of great importance... so great you forgot to wear underwear...?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:undine,direction:down=smirk,A more base person might accuse that fishy smell of coming from somewhere else...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Who is this great spirit you've invoked, Sheena?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:syrenne,direction:down=interested,And to think, if you hadn't have spilled your drink, this would've been completely different.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:4,direction:down=smirk,...you think I could support your chest with my hands? It might be a great workout for my hands...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zizou,targetStage:5,direction:down=yikes,Revenge... magic?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,direction:down=yikes,Though, I suppose that could change! The rules, like me, can be flexible, honestly!
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,direction:down=joy,I’m quite good with my hands, I’ve been told, and those seem to fit perfectly…
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:catria,direction:down=chuckle,What I mean to say is that your <i>ass</i>ets lie elsewhere.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:lotte,targetStage:6,direction:down=interested,Oh, my apologies, Lotte. They're just quite pink! Bigger than mine, if that's consolation...

-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:mae,targetSaying:weight,direction:down=interested,Oh... is that... a problem where you're from? A woman with curves is very desirable... the cat ears... maybe less so.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:miko,direction:down=interested,It... would allow one to pretend to being male, after all. Uh... yes. One's wife.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:navi,targetStage:2,direction:down=dishonor,(<i>Why do I always get the spirits that are a little... unusual...</i>)
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:remilia,direction:down=smirk,I guess a <i>commoner</i> like me was destined to see your chest, Remilia.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:sayori,targetStage:6,direction:down=smirk,If you hold your nerve... I bet ~player~ would hold your hand... <i>(Or something else, if you'd prefer?</i>)
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:zizou,targetStage:6,direction:down=challenge,I would've liked you to have shown your best from the start... but let's see what you can do, Zizou!
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,direction:down=surprise,Now those are some moons I wouldn’t be on the dark side of.

-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6,direction:down=interested,I can’t say I’m in a position to dispute this, though.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:elizabeth,direction:down=chuckle,You have beautiful breasts, Elizabeth! I suppose they'd look even better in candlelight... alone... with just us...
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:ini,targetStage:5,direction:down=yikes,I... suppose her disguise worked, though...
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:juri,targetStage:3,direction:down=yikes,If you're trying to seduce me to evil, it won't work! ...Right?
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:revy,direction:down=dishonor,"Quickly find their own fields aflame.”

-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:miko,direction:down=joy,I respect your conviction, Crown Prince. If I weren't loyal to my emperor, I would surely find myself in the host of your elite warriors.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:navi,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,Hm. I've heard of some women covering themselves in flowers...

#finished
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,direction:down=joy,Well, I could always go another round...
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:corrin_m,direction:down=interested,Oh, I see. You and your wife have a rather interesting relationship, Corrin.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:jin,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Well, at least you have a body to back up that confidence.
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:jotaro,targetStage:4,direction:down=chuckle,I enjoy a man with some fight in him!
-1-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:pit,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,This may sound like an excuse to look at your... rear...
-1-male_chest_is_visible,direction:down=challenge,...But only after you take off the rest.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:9s,direction:down=surprise,...For a game that isn’t for children, it seems odd to censor a man’s nipples.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:corrin_m,direction:down=smirk,It’s impressive, in some ways. Refreshing to see such honesty, especially among nobles.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:jin,targetStage:5,direction:down=surprise,I wasn't checking you out. It doesn't make up for your play so far. No way.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:jotaro,targetStage:5,direction:down=smirk,Impressive, Jotaro. I'd like to see how you wrestle.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:pit,targetStage:4,direction:down=surprise,But since your shirt's off, can I see how your wings attach?
-1-male_chest_is_visible,target:ryuji,targetStage:5,direction:down=chuckle,Impressive. How many of those can you do?
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,direction:down=interested,Usually I’m… much quieter, alone in my bunk…
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kamina,targetStage:5,count-coco:0,direction:down=smirk,It would be... a new challenge for me to appreciate. I think.
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:thong,marker:thong_mulan,direction:down=surprise,Oh my, how exotic. That… thong, is something a courtesan would wear… but a high class one.
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:thong,marker:thong_mulan,direction:down=chuckle,Huh! I haven’t seen underwear like that before. It just shows off everything so <i>well</i>! I might have to invest in a pair of those before I head home.
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jin,targetStage:6,direction:down=denial,I can think of several people, myself included who'd be disappointed with that.
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jotaro,targetStage:6,direction:down=interested,No using your sorcery, this time?
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kamina,targetStage:5,direction:down=surprise,Well, I guess I'm still plenty manly, at least.
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kamina,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:coco,alsoPlayingStage:7-10,direction:down=challenge,It would be... a new challenge for me to appreciate. I enjoyed Coco's version, but I think I'd like yours even more, Kamina.
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ryuji,direction:down=interested,It'll be fine. You can do this.
-1-male_small_crotch_is_visible,direction:down=joy,But I can be very discreet with that, ~name~...
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,direction:down=challenge,I think I might have to be a little loud, in just a moment...
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:ryuji,direction:down=surprise,Oh! Your hair's dyed! I've thought about that... rarely. Impressive!
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,direction:down=challenge,I don’t know if I could keep quiet, with something like that…
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:jin,targetStage:7,direction:down=interested,I suppose getting to see Fujin <i>and</i> this sword was far from the worst outcome.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:jotaro,targetStage:7,direction:down=chuckle,Ai-yah! Here I was, worried you were overcompensating! I suppose you'd be right at home in the <i>Wang</i> dynasty.
-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:kamina,targetStage:6,direction:down=smirk,Impressive. I don't suppose I could give it a swing or two? I've never handled a <i>drill</i> like that.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,direction:down=joy,You’ve held out very well, ~name~!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5,direction:down=yikes,In war, deception can win many battles… but this seems a bit like overt disregard of the rules…
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:catria,direction:down=smirk,Catria, you don't need to be embarrassed by your body. Not when you have a sizable <i>arse</i>nal...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ini,targetStage:4,direction:down=denial,It was an act!? I can't believe that fooled me!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:juri,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,So... vulgar...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mae,direction:down=interested,There's no shame in an honest lost, Mae. Besides, you're exceptionally beautiful.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:miko,direction:down=smirk,Of course <i>I</i> agree with you, Crown Prince.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:navi,targetStage:1,direction:down=chuckle,Normally, I'm all about modesty. In this game, I suppose I should appreciate the unusual view?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:raven,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,You couldn't get to your bra first, I suppose...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:remilia,targetStage:4,direction:down=challenge,I'll make my own destiny, thanks. And that means watching you lose!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:revy,direction:down=yikes,“Those who set fires against their neighbors…”
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sayaka,targetStage:3,direction:down=smirk,I don't think there's any shame in wanting to see your--
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sayori,targetStage:5,direction:down=interested,There's no need to fear now, Sayori! Hold your nerve!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:celsius,direction:down=surprise,No need to give us the cold shoulder...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:luna,direction:down=chuckle,Not quite the moon I wanted to see, Sheena, but your spirit guide is gorgeous!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:shadow,direction:down=denial,...Imprisoning Sheena? All that I see?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:sylph,direction:down=joy,So many spirit guides! You must be on a quest of great importance... so great you forgot to wear underwear...?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetSaidMarker:undine,direction:down=smirk,A more base person might accuse that fishy smell of coming from somewhere else...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetStage:4,direction:down=interested,Who is this great spirit you've invoked, Sheena?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:syrenne,direction:down=interested,And to think, if you hadn't have spilled your drink, this would've been completely different.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:4,direction:down=smirk,...you think I could support your chest with my hands? It might be a great workout for my hands...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zizou,targetStage:5,direction:down=yikes,Revenge... magic?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,direction:down=yikes,Though, I suppose that could change! The rules, like me, can be flexible, honestly!
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,direction:down=interested,Don’t be so shy, ~name~. You have the right build to be a great wrestler. Want me to prove it?
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:catria,direction:down=chuckle,What I mean to say is that your <i>ass</i>ets lie elsewhere.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:lotte,targetStage:6,direction:down=interested,Oh, my apologies, Lotte. They're just quite pink! Bigger than mine, if that's consolation...
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:mae,targetSaying:fat,direction:down=interested,Oh... is that... a problem where you're from? A woman with curves is very desirable...  the cat ears... maybe less so.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:mae,targetSaying:weight,direction:down=interested,Oh... is that... a problem where you're from? A woman with curves is very desirable... the cat ears... maybe less so.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:miko,direction:down=interested,It... would allow one to pretend to being male, after all. Uh... yes. One's wife.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:navi,targetStage:2,direction:down=dishonor,(<i>Why do I always get the spirits that are a little... unusual...</i>)
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:remilia,direction:down=smirk,I guess a <i>commoner</i> like me was destined to see your chest, Remilia.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:sayori,targetStage:6,direction:down=smirk,If you hold your nerve... I bet ~player~ would hold your hand... <i>(Or something else, if you'd prefer?</i>)
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:zizou,targetStage:6,direction:down=challenge,I would've liked you to have shown your best from the start... but let's see what you can do, Zizou!
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,direction:down=interested,Not too small, not too big… I should give them a feel. Just to make sure they’re as perfect as they seem to be.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6,direction:down=interested,I can’t say I’m in a position to dispute this, though.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:elizabeth,direction:down=chuckle,You have beautiful breasts, Elizabeth! I suppose they'd look even better in candlelight... alone... with just us...
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:ini,targetStage:5,direction:down=yikes,I... suppose her disguise worked, though...
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:juri,targetStage:3,direction:down=yikes,If you're trying to seduce me to evil, it won't work! ...Right?
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:revy,direction:down=dishonor,"Quickly find their own fields aflame.”
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,direction:down=surprise,--bra!? What a surprise!
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:4,direction:down=joy,And you're all about training, right?
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan,direction:down=chuckle,<i>Hm.</i> You certainly are animated... Even down to, um, the tits.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,direction:down=challenge,I guess the big stuff does tend to come last…
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:sheena,targetStage:5,direction:down=challenge,There's clearly more to you than meets the eye. And there was already so much to enjoy!
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:syrenne,direction:down=challenge,Impressive, but... combat equipped? Perhaps not.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:syrenne,totalNaked:1,notSaidMarker:duel_lost,marker:syrenne_duel,direction:down=smirk,About our little duel, Syrenne, what's been your greatest feat of drinking? Or... really, any night at the tavern?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,direction:down=interested,Like all gifts, I think unwrapping you last is worth the wait.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:thong,marker:thong_mulan,direction:down=surprise,Oh my, how exotic. That… thong, is something a courtesan would wear… but a high class one.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:thong,marker:thong_mulan,direction:down=chuckle,Huh! I haven’t seen underwear like that before. It just shows off everything so <i>well</i>! I might have to invest in a pair of those before I head home.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aella,direction:down=challenge,But as someone once said, a journey of a thousand miles…
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:catria,direction:down=joy,Oh, come now, Catria. Well, don't <i>come</i> yet...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elizabeth,direction:down=interested,In truth, the rumors you hear of the other Princesses aren't wholly accurate...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:haru,direction:down=yikes,...As long as you're truly comfortable, Haru.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ini,targetStage:5,direction:down=chuckle,Well, I guess now we'll see your true face!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,Ah, you must be from a world near the Land of Dragons... I see that women there are... afforded more freedom, perhaps.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:miko,direction:down=joy,I respect your conviction, Crown Prince. If I weren't loyal to my emperor, I would surely find myself in the host of your elite warriors.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:navi,targetStage:2,direction:down=interested,Hm. I've heard of some women covering themselves in flowers...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:palutena,direction:down=surprise,Well, Mushu is always nude. And Elsa has a bad habit about getting naked around Anna, and I don’t always think she’s quite human…
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven,targetStage:3,direction:down=interested,I guess we'll see...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:remilia,targetStage:5,direction:down=peace,Though, let's see how you look when you're alone and naked.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayori,targetStage:6,direction:down=interested,I was actually quite impressed with your underwear! It looks so comfortable... but...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sheena,targetStage:5,direction:down=interested,...Go on...?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:syrenne,direction:down=dishonor,At least it didn't break... are you okay, Syrenne?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:0,direction:down=surprise,Whoa, hold on, Twilight, there’s no need to be so vulgar so soon--
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:2,direction:down=surprise,Oh. Nevermind then. I guess I should've trained more for this...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zizou,targetStage:6,direction:down=surprise,Surely, you're wearing underwear? Of some divine type?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zizou,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:5-8,direction:down=dishonor,Surely, unlike Futaba, you wore <i>some</i> kind of underwear?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,direction:down=smirk,I think you'd keep things very, very interesting, as a member of our society.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,direction:down=challenge,And after I’m already finished. For shame, ~name~! Did you think this was a sleepover?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:blonde,priority:0,direction:down=chuckle,I know a blonde girl who can do crazy stuff with her hair. And that does mean all of it.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:brunette,priority:0,direction:down=interested,Hm... It's such a lighter shade than my own. Fascinating...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:ginger,priority:0,direction:down=smirk,Oh, I see. Like Ariel's, or Merida's.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy,direction:down=dishonor,Far be it for me to tell another woman how to groom, but should you maybe consider trimming that? Just a little?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved,direction:down=peace,I’m still not sure about that look, but I can see it growing on me. Uh, not literally, but you get what I mean.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed,direction:down=challenge,Is that a lot of work to do? I mean, the trim and all that.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aella,saidMarker:challenge_answer,direction:down=joy,...begins with a single strip. Step. Eheh. Just worry less and fight harder, I suppose.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee,saidMarker:challenge_answer,direction:down=denial,I have a vague worry that you’re going to hit someone by the end of this… and that’s not really in good taste…
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee,saidMarker:challenge_answer,direction:down=surprise,I’ve blown up a cannon on myself before, but nothing like this…

#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written
male_must_masturbate,direction:down=interested,I’ve only seen this a few times… but I can tell a lot based on sound and rustling sheets…
male_start_masturbating,direction:down=joy,That’s… quite alluring. Your face captures your enjoyment well.
male_masturbating,direction:down=peace,Hm… I don’t suppose you’d mind doing this somewhere a little more private later? I have questions.
male_masturbating,direction:down=interested,Clearly <i>I’ve</i> never had to handle myself like that… but…
male_finished_masturbating,direction:down=challenge,Don’t worry ~name~, you’ll have time to catch your breath.
female_must_masturbate,direction:down=challenge,If you were going to think of me, looking so put together in my armor…
female_start_masturbating,direction:down=peace,Hope you don’t mind thinking of me, even though I’m not a man.
female_masturbating,direction:down=interested,Women need their time, right? Time to put on makeup… to finish… to learn martial arts and defend the family honor… you know, sexy, uh, womanly things.
female_masturbating,direction:down=interested,Is this how you say goodbye to those you’ve known, ~name~? Thinking of a romance shared under some falling petals? Um, don’t mind me. Just… thinking.
female_finished_masturbating,direction:down=peace,They say a measure of elegance is timeliness. Thanks for not taking <i>terribly</i> too long.

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.

-2-masturbating,direction:down=challenge,Not <i>quite</i> the thrill of combat…
-2-masturbating,direction:down=joy,T-there’s honestly something appealing about having to hide this…
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:9s,saidMarker:duel_lost,notSaidMarker:duel_9s_lost,marker:duel_9s_lost,direction:down=denial,W-well, I usually need to get a ride from one of the other Princesses or this boy with a magic key. I don't really understand it, there's a mouse... it's all very strange. Best left a mystery, really.
-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:akko,saidMarker:duel_lost,notSaidMarker:duel_akko_lost,marker:duel_akko_lost,direction:down=challenge,Well, Akko, most magic in my world tends to be pretty small stuff. Nothing like what you use. Mostly spirits and monsters, rather than fireballs and transofrming.

A concubine of a magistrate gifted me a <i>very</i> satisfying implement of pure jade after I rescued her from bandits. It's... quite decadent to masturbate with something so valuable.
