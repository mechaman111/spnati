        <text>
            &lt;div class="text-center small"&gt;&lt;i&gt;
            With pen in hand I look to the sky &lt;br/&gt;
            And stand at the edge of a vast web&lt;br/&gt;
            Holding infinite choices&lt;br/&gt;
            &lt;br/&gt;
            A wave of color and noise&lt;br/&gt;
            Spills and splatters before me&lt;br/&gt;
            Red, white, green, blue, black&lt;br/&gt;
            Sights and sounds waiting just below&lt;br/&gt;
            &lt;br/&gt;
            Try as I might, I can't see the bottom.&lt;br/&gt;
            What lies beneath? &lt;br/&gt;
            Danger? Knowledge? Love? &lt;br/&gt;
            &lt;br/&gt;
            Swallowing my fears, I plunge into the depths... &lt;br/&gt;
            &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
