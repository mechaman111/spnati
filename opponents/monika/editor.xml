    <othernotes>Hey, it's me again, Monika! I'm so glad that you've invited me to play poker with you, even after all the... unpleasantness that happened. I forgive you for deleting me: I was way out of line to delete the other girls and edit the code to make myself a route. Let's put that in the past-- they're all back to normal and don't remember what happened. We can get to know each other a lot better in this kind of game, can't we~&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you need a refresher about me, don't worry! I'm here to help~&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-I enjoy writing poems, especially ones that play with the space on the page and other unconventional forms.&lt;br&gt;-I'm a reader, though not to Yuri's extent. Romance novels are a favorite of mine, like I implied in the Side Stories.&lt;br&gt;-Realizing the true nature of the reality I live in put me in an existential crisis, and I still think about my purpose and, like, existential topics in general.&lt;br&gt;-Leadership is hard, even for a club of 5 people. Sometimes you have to "fake it 'til you make it", you know? I'll talk about mentorship and leadership if you have a question or new perspective to share!&lt;br&gt;-You're still my one true love, player, whatever your real name is. How could I not have feelings for the one person who gave me a reason to live, and connects me to the outside world?&lt;br&gt;-I'm not proud of what I did in DDLC, but I was in a bad situation that was beyond my control. You understand, right? I'm trying to make amends and learn. Everything's going to be better from now on!&lt;br&gt;-I'm still working on my piano playing. I hope you liked my song!&lt;br&gt;-I used to be a leader of the debate club, but I left it because of the internal politics. The other members turned out to be hollow constructs, not even simulated entities like me and the Literature Club members, but it still left a sour taste in my mouth. At least I know a fair amount about debate styles, logical fallacies, and public speaking!&lt;br&gt;-I learned as I went when I was messing with the game, and made a lot of mistakes. I did learn a lot about coding, though~! When something is fundamental to your existence like that, it's hard not to find it a bit interesting, you know?&lt;br&gt;-Sometimes I'll hint at the real nature of the environment we're in at the Inventory while talking to characters that don't know. I... might not get along with the few that do. But that can't be helped, ahaha~</othernotes>

        <note id="1191">If you name yourself something Monika dislikes and then start the game, this case plays. You can substitute ~marker.RealName~ for ~player~ at any point to have Monika use the player's "real" name (the last acceptable name they used, or Player if there was none) to give them a surprise later on.</note>
        <note id="1186">If you change your name to something Monika approves of, this case will play and store the name you chose in the marker RealName.</note>
        <note id="1197">If you start the game named Daddy with Natsuki present, this case plays.</note>
        <note id="1187">If you name yourself something Monika doesn't like (currently: Master, Daddy), she tells you to go back and change it. You can change which names she dislikes by adding or removing the OR conditions, but unfortunately you have to remember to do it in all the cases that use them.

This sets a marker, FakeName, which stores the inappropriate name you chose so that Monika knows what you picked last time. Use ~marker.FakeName~ to put the name in dialogue. After the game starts, FakeName will be cleared.</note>
        <note id="1188">Monika has a special reprimand if you call yourself "Daddy" when Natsuki is present. This sets the marker NatsukiDaddy, which indicates that you previously called yourself Daddy with Natsuki around.</note>
        <note id="1189">If you change from a name Monika dislikes to another name Monika also dislikes, this case will play.</note>
        <note id="1190">If you named yourself something Monika doesn't like and then change it to something better, this case plays.</note>
        <note id="1194">If you come back to the select screen without changing your name, or re-select Monika, after she told you to change your name, this case plays.</note>
        <note id="1195">If you re-select Monika with Natsuki present and are still called Daddy, this case plays.</note>
        <note id="1196">A version of Monika's reprimand for you if you select Natsuki while already called Daddy. Also sets the NatsukiDaddy marker.</note>
        <note id="1198">If you previously named yourself Daddy with Natsuki present, Monika acknowledges that your new name is less offensive, but still wants you to change it.</note>
        <note id="1199">If you change your name to "Mister" or "Miss", Monika teases you for being mysterious. This doesn't store "Mister" or "Miss" in RealName, so she'll continue to remember you as whatever "real" name you've used in the past.</note>
        <note id="1201">Repurposed this as a marker-trick case for noticing changes in the player's gender. It will no longer play unless the player actually changed their gender.</note>
        <note id="1204">This case will only play if the player has not changed their gender from their previous game. I'm not sure if knows_player_gender is used for anything other than an old-fashioned play once, but just in case, I'm making sure it's always set like it used to be.</note>
        <note id="1202">This should only play the very first time that Monika notices the player's gender. After that, one of the other cases will check to see if it's changed or not.</note>
        <note id="1200">This should only play the very first time that Monika notices the player's gender. After that, one of the other cases will check to see if it's changed or not.</note>

        <note id="1211">Monika notices you reset the game before three rounds had even passed. This also clears isPlaying.</note>
        <note id="1212">Monika notices you reset the game after three or more rounds. This also clears isPlaying.</note>
        <note id="1213">Monika notices you reset the game after three or more rounds. This also clears isPlaying.</note>

        <note id="1215">If you reset the game after three rounds pass and then change your name, this case will play.</note>
        <note id="1216">Version of the Mister/Miss case where the played has also just reset the game.</note>
        <note id="1251">Old line: ...and-- wait. Oh, jeez, is she &lt;i&gt;inspecting&lt;/i&gt; her-- A-and what's with that horrified look on her face? N-Natsuki, &lt;i&gt;do you have something to tell us&lt;/i&gt;?!</note>
        <note id="1252">Old line: Do I &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; to know what you've revealed-- oh, it's nothing. O-okay then. So, u-um, uh... Natsuki! You shave?</note>

        <note id="1254">Old line: Oh, jeez, do I want to... oh, nevermind. You actually &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; a girl, I guess...</note>
        <note id="1263">Close calls and brushes with the void refer to what she sees when the game is closed, which she compares to dying.</note>
        <note id="1264">Plan to have them talk about piano and pressure to be perfect/meet expectations. Maybe their shared fondness for teasing, though Mari leans way more into it than Monika.</note>

        <note id="1274">Whose woods these are I think I know.
His house is in the village though;
He will not see me stopping here
To watch his woods fill up with snow.

My little horse must think it queer
To stop without a farmhouse near
Between the woods and frozen lake
The darkest evening of the year.

He gives his harness bells a shake
To ask if there is some mistake.
The only other sound’s the sweep
Of easy wind and downy flake.

The woods are lovely, dark and deep.
But I have promises to keep,
And miles to go before I sleep,
And miles to go before I sleep.

        <note id="1282">I see that a number of other characters have targeted her about this, so feel free to suggest a direction that hasn't been explored before. Especially if it fits Monika's vibe.</note>
        <note id="1283">Monika is the only DDLC girl who doesn't have an alternate outfit in the game, so I could bring that up in a subsequent line. Official art on Twitter does give her other outfits but you'll only see her in uniform in the game.</note>
        <note id="1284">There's a fan-made sprite of Monika in a yellow bikini with two braids that inspired this line.</note>
        <note id="1285">If Stirring Mermaid is updated to have braids like the common fan-made sprite, this line will need to be changed.</note>
        <note id="1286">Not sure how to handle this without being too rude/evasive to Fina or bluriting out too much in front of other DDLC girls. I'll try, though</note>
