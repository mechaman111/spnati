If Nagisa to left and Barbara to right:

NAGISA MUST STRIP SHOES:
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_attention]: Oh, it's me? I'm not too good at being the center of attention, but I'll do my best to improve.
Barbara [NagisaShoes1A]: I understand, Nagisa. It's stage fright, isn't it? I felt the same way when I first got up on the stage.

NAGISA STRIPPING SHOES (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_performing]: I want to re-start the drama club, but I don't know how I'm ever going to perform if I keep feeling like this. Do you go on stage often, Barbara? How do you do it?
Barbara [NagisaShoes2A]: I go up on the stage all the time, Nagisa. It's difficult at first, but you just need to keep at it. More than anything, I can assure you that the crowd wants you to succeed. Don't let their gaze scare you.

NAGISA STRIPPED SHOES (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_professional]: I'm glad I have a professional to help me! But what do you do at times where people don't want you to succeed? Like, do you get the feeling that not everyone wants us to succeed to~background.time~?
Barbara [NagisaShoes3A]: Do others truly not want you to succeed, Nagisa, or does your own doubt make you feel that way? In either case, I think you should simply try you best, even if you might not succeed at first. Failure is the first step to success.


NAGISA MUST STRIP SOCKS:
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_second_step]: I didn't fail twice. This is just the second step to success. That's what I learned to~background.time~!
Barbara [NagisaSocks1A]: That's right, Nagisa. You might stumble, but you just need to get up and try again... a-and, well, failure isn't the worst thing in a game like this.

NAGISA STRIPPING SOCKS (minor):
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_make_others_happy]: Yeah. I have to remember that even if it makes it a little bit hard for me, it's worth it to see someone else be happy. Not that taking my socks off is hard at all, hehe.
Barbara [NagisaSocks2A]: I'm glad we're of the same mind. Making others happy, even when it's difficult... That's what I strive for. Oh, but it's important not to forget about your own happiness along the way.

NAGISA STRIPPED SOCKS (minor): (not strictly conditional on previous case)
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_supported]: Thanks for being so supportive, everybody!
Barbara [NagisaSocks3A]: And I'll keep on supporting you, Nagisa! I hope you'll do the same for me in turn.


NAGISA MUST STRIP JACKET:
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_no_siblings]: I'm not used to other people watching me take my uniform off. But maybe that's because I don't have any brothers and sisters, so I have my own bedroom to get changed in.
Barbara [NagisaJacket1A]: Ah... You're an only child, Nagisa? I was raised like one myself, though I do actually have an older sister.

NAGISA STRIPPING JACKET (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_big_family]: Oh, you have an older sister, Barbara? What's her name? I'd love to have a sister. Wouldn't it be so much fun to have a big family?
Barbara [NagisaJacket2A]: Her name is Jean. I... wish I could agree with you, Nagisa, but the truth is that I don't know her very well. Our parents separated when we were very young, you see...

NAGISA STRIPPED JACKET (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_jean]: Oh, that's so tragic. Instead of getting bigger, having a sister made your family get smaller. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you feel sad.
Barbara [NagisaJacket3A]: Oh no, it's okay! It happened a long time ago. It's just... I wish I knew how to get closer to her. I want us to feel like sisters again, but right now, we're more like strangers...


NAGISA MUST STRIP SHIRT:
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_mess_up]: Why is everyone looking at me? Oh. Sometimes I wish people would notice me this much when I did something good, not just when I mess up...
Barbara [NagisaShirt1A]: W-Well, it is the point of the game, Nagisa... And besides that, I know <i>I'm</i> not looking at you because you messed up. I simply want to support you. This is just another step to success, remember?

NAGISA STRIPPING SHIRT (major):
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_new_goal]: That's right. Trying to win isn't a very realistic goal for me. Maybe I should make my goal to lose in a way that everyone can respect.
Barbara [NagisaShirt2A]: It's not about winning or losing, Nagisa. That's what I've been trying to tell you. It's about having fun and making the most of what you're given, whether you succeed or you fail. In that regard, I think you're doing a wonderful job.

NAGISA STRIPPED SHIRT (major):
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_pretty_bra]: I'll do my best... If I want to make the most of this... I've never gotten to show this bra to anyone, but I think it's pretty. So now everyone can see it. I hope you like it.
Barbara [NagisaShirt3A]: I think it's beautiful, Nagisa! And I'm happy you can get something positive out of this experience. I know showing off your body to everybody is nerve-wracking, but if it helps, I think you're very cute.


NAGISA MUST STRIP SKIRT:
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_not_shown_normally]: W-Would anyone like to see something else I'm wearing? I... I don't show people normally...
Barbara [NagisaSkirt1A]: I'm more than happy to see whatever you have to share with us, Nagisa. I'll support you till the very end!

NAGISA STRIPPING SKIRT (major):
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_underwear_set]: I bought these as a set. I don't wear them all the time... just, um, just when I want to feel a little bit cute without anyone else knowing...
Barbara [NagisaSkirt2A]: That's adorable, Nagisa! It's important to do things for yourself, too, not just for other people. If wearing those makes you feel cute, I think that's incredible. Thank you for sharing with us.

NAGISA STRIPPED SKIRT (major):
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_cute_underwear]: I think lots of girls would be happy to show off all of the cute underwear they buy... If it wasn't so embarrassing, that is.
Barbara [NagisaSkirt3A1]* [0-3]: This is a free and open space, Nagisa. You're free to share whatever you like with us. Oh, and your underwear <i>is</i> awfully cute!
Barbara [NagisaSkirt3A2]* [4-8]: I-I understand what you mean, Nagisa, but it feels a little ironic to agree with you...


NAGISA MUST STRIP BRA:
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_out_of_energy]: I got a bit too excited earlier, but I think I'm all out of energy now...
Barbara [NagisaBra1A]: I understand, Nagisa. When I get up on the stage, I feel like I have all the energy in the world... but afterwards, all I want to do is take a nap.

NAGISA STRIPPING BRA (revealing chest):
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_wide_awake]: I'm sure I'll be able to sleep when I go home. But for now, I'm wide awake...
Barbara [NagisaBra2A]: A-Ah, of course. This situation is far too exciting for me to even think about dozing off... I wouldn't want to miss everything you have to show me.

NAGISA STRIPPED BRA (revealed chest):
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_breast_debut]: H-Here they are. It's... it's kind of like their debut performance, so please let me know if there's anything I could do to make it better.
Barbara [NagisaBra3A]: A debut performance... Ehehe, you're talking like they're idols in and of themselves. You don't have to hide them, Nagisa. They're shining even brighter than myself.


NAGISA MUST STRIP PANTIES:
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_excitement_levels]: Sorry that I'm not better at this. Um, it's... it's time. Do you really think people want to see me with all my clothes off? I mean, I would like it if someone was at little excited maybe. But not <i>too</i> excited... Sorry if I'm not making sense!
Barbara [NagisaPanties1A]: Oh, I'm excited! But, um, not <i>too</i> excited! I think you're very cute, Nagisa, but it feels strange to think about you in a lewd light. You're just so sweet and innocent...

NAGISA STRIPPING PANTIES (revealing crotch):
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_do_this_now]: I'm sorry! If I don't do this now, I'll never do it!
Barbara [NagisaPanties2A]: T-Take your time, Nagisa! Or... don't, if that's what you prefer! I'm rooting for you either way!

NAGISA STRIPPED PANTIES (revealed crotch):
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_innocent]: I'm sure you don't think I'm innocent anymore, but I had to start doing adult stuff sometime. I'm still the same person on the inside, though.
Barbara [NagisaPanties3A]: We all have to become adults sometime, but that doesn't mean we have to change who we are. I'll always love singing and dancing and helping people, and I hope you can keep doing what you love too, Nagisa.

---

BARBARA MUST STRIP HAT:
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_nurse]: Every nurse I meet is so nice, and your outfits are so pretty. Is that what you wear to work, Barbara? I like how unique it is.
Barbara [NagisaHat1AReply]: I wear this to all three of my jobs, Nagisa. Not only as a nurse, but as a Deaconess and an idol too. I needed an outfit befitting all three!

BARBARA STRIPPING HAT (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_so_busy]: You must be so busy! I hope your bosses are nice. They must be if they gave you time off to play to~background.time~.
Barbara [NagisaHat2AReply]: It's not so bad, Nagisa. My only "boss" is Cardinal Calvin in the Church -- but he's so busy that I've hardly seen him in months. Though it's true that all of my work keeps me awfully busy...

BARBARA STRIPPED HAT (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_manager]: I thought all idols had managers too. Do you have a manager? You didn't sneak out and not tell your manager you were coming, did you?!
Barbara [NagisaHat3AReply]: N-Nothing like that, Nagisa. A woman named Alice taught me what it means to be an idol, but she's more a mentor than a manager. Learning songs, memorizing routines, putting on shows -- I do that all on my own.


BARBARA MUST STRIP SHOES:
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_naughty_idol]: Um, sorry to ask this, but are you sure you won't get in trouble for this, Barbara? I don't know what the rules are for Deaconesses, but I know idols aren't meant to do anything naughty.
Barbara [NagisaShoes1AReply]: It's alright, Nagisa. The Church of Favonius preaches freedom above all else. I'm free to do whatever I wish here... and, well, none of my fans have to know that I'm here.

BARBARA STRIPPING SHOES (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_fan_secret]: Oh, so it's a secret. Now I understand. Even if I become your fan, I definitely won't tell any of your other fans.
Barbara [NagisaShoes2AReply]: Ehehe, thank you. It's only my fans in Teyvat that I'm worried about, but if you became a fan of mine, I would be truly blessed.

BARBARA STRIPPED SHOES (accessory):
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_new_fan]: I'd like to become your fan if you'd let me. I have a little bit of money put aside, so I could buy your CD next time I go to the shopping district.
Barbara [NagisaShoes3AReply]: A "See-Dee?" I'm sorry, Nagisa, but I'm not sure what that is. If you would truly like to become a fan of mine, I only ask for your support. Of course, if you came to my shows, that would make me happy too, hehe.


BARBARA MUST STRIP COLLAR:
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_nurse_query]: Barbara, if you're not too busy, I'd love to hear about how you decided to become a nurse. Is it something you always wanted to do?
Barbara [NagisaCollar1AReply]: My father is the leader of our Church, and I've always wanted to follow in his footsteps. It wasn't until I began working at the Church that I decided to become a healer, though.

BARBARA STRIPPING COLLAR (minor):
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_church_help]: Oh, I see. That makes sense. If you worked at the church, I'm sure people would come to you for help.
Barbara [NagisaCollar2AReply]: That's right. The sick and needy come to us all the time for help. Once, I was tasked with healing an ailing boy. I wasn't a singer or a healer at the time, but I did the only thing I could think of and sang to him until he fell asleep.

BARBARA STRIPPED COLLAR (minor):
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_boy_story]: Aw, that's so sweet. Did the boy start feeling better after you sang to him?
Barbara [NagisaCollar3AReply]: Yes, his fever had come down by the time he awoke. When <i>I</i> awoke, I discovered this -- my Vision, an artifact granted to me by my Archon that gifts me my healing magic. It was then I knew it was my duty to help everybody I possibly can.


BARBARA MUST STRIP DRESS:
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_transform]: Oh, Barbara, is it time for your transformation sequence?
Barbara [NagisaDress1AReply]: A... "transformation sequence?" Um, I'm not sure I have anything like that, Nagisa. I-I have to strip the same way as everybody else...

BARBARA STRIPPING DRESS (major):
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_use_magic]: I just thought... I just thought if you could use magic, maybe you might be able undress ~player.ifMale(in a way that might not get boys too excited...|without needing help with your zipper. If you have a zipper. I'm not really sure now.)~
Barbara [NagisaDress2AReply]: That's a nice idea, Nagisa, but I'm afraid my magic isn't capable of anything like that. Besides... I <i>want</i> everybody to look at me while I do this. Simply removing it with magic would remove part of the fun...

BARBARA STRIPPED DRESS (major):
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_doing_it_right]: Oh, I see. Well, since you insist, I'm sure we'd be happy to watch. Are... are we doing it right?
Barbara [NagisaDress3AReply]: Ehehe, there's no right or wrong way, Nagisa. I only hope I can make this as enjoyable as possible for you... So long as my performance makes the both of us happy, I think we're playing this game correctly.


BARBARA MUST STRIP BRA:
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_hair_down]: Barbara, sorry for interrupting. Um, you don't have to doing anything too serious right away. Have you ever thought about letting your hair down? Your fans might really like it if you did that instead...
Barbara [NagisaBra1AReply]: Well, Nagisa, I actually like having my hair up like this. It makes me feel cute... and a little closer to my big sister. She always wears her hair up in a ponytail...

BARBARA STRIPPING BRA (revealing chest):
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_wwjd]: O-Okay. As long as you think this is something your sister would do, I'm sure you'd have her support.
Barbara [NagisaBra2AReply]: Th-That's not what I meant, Nagisa. I based my hairstyle on hers, and... Erm, it's not important. I simply like having my hair up like this -- a-and I think I've taken off enough already, don't you?

BARBARA STRIPPED BRA (revealed chest):
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_more_than_enough]: Y-Yes, I think that's more than enough. You're very pretty, Barbara, so even one booby would have been enough...
Barbara [NagisaBra3AReply]: Ehehe, thank you. I think you're pretty too.


BARBARA MUST STRIP PANTYHOSE:
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_medical_professional]: I hope this is okay, Barbara. I know you're a medical professional, and I heard they don't get shy about the human body...
Barbara [NagisaPantyhose1AReply]: A "medical professional"... You're not wrong, but I usually don't think about it that way. M-Most of my healing doesn't involve getting this... up close and personal...

BARBARA STRIPPING PANTYHOSE (revealing crotch):
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_human_body]: If it helps, I'll try to think of you as one of those diagrams of the human body except much more beautiful.
Barbara [NagisaPantyhose2AReply]: Oh? U-Um, that's really not necessary... Rather, I would prefer you to see me as I am, Nagisa. Barbara, the idol of Mondstadt, bearing it all for you... D-Do you like it?

BARBARA STRIPPED PANTYHOSE (revealed crotch):
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_nice_to_meet_you]: You're the perfect idol, Barbara. You're pretty from head to toe, and you're so fun to chat to. I feel kind of guilty that we got to play with you instead of your fans back home, but it's been great getting to know you. I don't usually get to know people <i>this</i> well on the first day...
Barbara [NagisaPantyhose3AReply]: You're too sweet. I'm happy that I got to know you too. T-These circumstances are a little unusual, but I'm almost happy we were able to get so... intimate. It makes me feel close to you. So... thank you, Nagisa.

DUE TO POSITION DETECTION, CONVERSATIONS ABOVE AND BELOW THIS LINE WON'T PLAY IN THE SAME GAME.

If Barbara to left and Nagisa to right:

NAGISA MUST STRIP SHOES:
Barbara [NagisaShoes1B]: You're a student, aren't you, Nagisa? Do you enjoy any extracurricular activities? I'd love to hear about what they offer where you're from.
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_clubs]: Yeah, I'm in my last year of high school. My school has a lot of clubs. We have clubs for caligraphy and choir and judo and soccer. I haven't been able to restart the drama club yet, but maybe I can when I get enough members.

NAGISA STRIPPING SHOES (accessory):
Barbara [NagisaShoes2B]: A choir club? My, I would love to participate in that. What draws you to the drama club? Are you perhaps interested in becoming an actress?
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_actress]: I don't think I'd be a good actress. I've never even seen a play! But there's this story I just feel like I have to share with everyone. I can't really explain it.

NAGISA STRIPPED SHOES (accessory):
Barbara [NagisaShoes3B]: That sounds lovely... A story so powerful that you just have to share it with everybody, no matter what. Do you think you could tell me anything about it?
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_fantasia_story]: It's about a girl who lives alone in a world that has ended. Not even passing time exists. It's a touching story.


NAGISA MUST STRIP SOCKS: (conditional on previous case)
Barbara [NagisaSocks1B]: That story you told me about, Nagisa... It sounds touching, but so sad at the same time. I can see why you would want to share it with others. Are you planning on being in the starring role?
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_starring_role]: Yes. I don't really think I'm suited for the part, but nobody else knows the story, and there's no script or book we can find about it.

NAGISA STRIPPING SOCKS (minor):
Barbara [NagisaSocks2B]: Is that so...? Then how did you hear about it in the first place? It must be quite rare if you can't find a script...
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_always_known]: I don't know. Maybe I read about it when I was just little. I just feel like I've always known how it goes.

NAGISA STRIPPED SOCKS (minor):
Barbara [NagisaSocks3B]: So it's like it's written into your mind? My, it's almost like you've had a mission set out for you since you were young. Almost like the mission my Archon has bestowed upon me.
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_mission]: I don't know if it's as important as a mission, but it just feels like something I should do everything I can to achieve, you know?


NAGISA MUST STRIP JACKET:
Barbara [NagisaJacket1B]: Oh, Nagisa, I should mention -- I have this thing called a Vision. It gives me the power to heal others with magic. If you ever need any healing, just let me know, okay?
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_healing]: Really? Wow, that sounds really useful. If you met someone who was hurt, could you fix them right up? If I find anyone like that, I'll let you know right away.

NAGISA STRIPPING JACKET (accessory):
Barbara [NagisaJacket2B]: Thank you, Nagisa. But make sure to think of yourself, too. I-I don't mean to offend you, but you do look a little frail. If you ever get hurt, I'll patch you up right away.
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_sick_sometimes]: That's so nice of you, but I think it's okay if you save your healing for someone who needs it more. I get sick sometimes, but it's nothing anyone can find a solution to, so it's okay.

NAGISA STRIPPED JACKET (accessory):
Barbara [NagisaJacket3B]: My healing isn't finite, Nagisa. And besides that, if there's a way for me to soothe you, I would be more than happy to provide it. It's my duty to lend my power to anybody who could use it -- especially if that person is a friend.
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_friendship]: Being your friend would be more than enough for me, Barbara.


NAGISA MUST STRIP SHIRT:
Barbara [NagisaShirt1B]: Oh, we're coming closer to the wire... I-Is this embarrassing for you, Nagisa? I could look away if you'd like.
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_undressing_eyes]: Um, yes, I'm getting really nervous now... But you don't have to look away, Barbara. I just don't like it when people are undressing me with their eyes, you know? I've never had that feeling before to~background.time~...

NAGISA STRIPPING SHIRT (major):
Barbara [NagisaShirt2B]: W-Well, this <i>is</i> strip poker, Nagisa... Though I promise that I haven't been looking at you in that way. When you're the one who's stripping, I simply can't help but look at you...
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_bra]: Um, as I'm sure you've guessed, I'm just wearing a bra under here. I'm sure you have lots of bras at home, and there's nothing special about mine....

NAGISA STRIPPED SHIRT (major):
Barbara [NagisaShirt3B]: It might be plain, Nagisa, but I still think it's very cute. T-Though I can't speak much about bras... I usually don't wear one under my dress. 
Nagisa (if Barbara dress on) [nagisa_barbara_bra_shocked]: You don't?!
Nagisa (if Barbara dressless) [nagisa_barbara_bra_still_counts]: It's not like one I've ever seen, but I think it still counts. You just have to be careful not to move around too much...
Nagisa (if Barbara topless) [nagisa_barbara_bra_strapless]: I'm not really sure what the word was for it, but what you had was strapless and it looks really cute. I don't think I've ever seen anything like that in a store though. Maybe in the swimsuit section.


NAGISA MUST STRIP SKIRT:
Barbara [NagisaSkirt1B]: One of the core tenets Barbatos preaches is freedom. I hope everything we're doing today is helping you feel more free to express yourself, Nagisa.
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_rude_words]: Barbara, you don't mean that I should say rude words, do you?

NAGISA STRIPPING SKIRT (major):
Barbara [NagisaSkirt2B]: W-What? Y-You can say whatever you want to, but I only mean that I hope this game is making you a little more comfortable in your own body...
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_f_word]: If I can say whatever I want to... Um, <i>F-</i><br><i>Frick!</i><br>I'm so sorry, everyone! It just seemed like the only time I'll ever get to say that.

NAGISA STRIPPED SKIRT (major):
Barbara [NagisaSkirt3B]: My, Nagisa, such language... Ehehe, I'm only joking. Still, if that's what you choose to do with your freedom, I'll support you wholeheartedly. 
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_dirty_talk]: I probably shouldn't say it again. After all, that kind of dirty talk is only for ~player.ifMale(a husband and wife to say to each other|two people who love each other very much)~.


NAGISA MUST STRIP BRA: (conditional on previous case)
Barbara [NagisaBra1B]: U-Um, Nagisa... You said earlier that coarse language should only be used between lovers... b-but don't you think something like this is far more intimate?
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_bath_bond]: I know what you mean, Barbara. In one way, there's almost like a unique bond that forms between people who go through something difficult together. But in another way, this is kind of what I imagine it'd be like to go to a public bath.

NAGISA STRIPPING BRA (revealing chest):
Barbara [NagisaBra2B]: Hmm, you might be right about that... A-At least, the nudity part. Public baths usually don't involve so much... self-pleasuring...
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_bath_pleasure]: M-Maybe I should've just pushed myself by going bathing instead... I don't want anyone to have to think about me undressing while they're pl--- while they're doing private things like that...

NAGISA STRIPPED BRA (revealed chest):
Barbara [NagisaBra3B]: Oh, but why not, Nagisa? You're so pretty... So skinny, and your chest is... U-Um, I'm sorry. I simply think that if any man or woman were to think about you, that's not a bad thing. It just goes to show how much they appreciate you.
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_soulmate]: Really? If there's someone out there for everyone, maybe there's at least one ~player.ifMale(boy|person)~ out there that might be okay with me...


NAGISA MUST STRIP PANTIES:
Barbara [NagisaPanties1B]: It looks like you're out of options, Nagisa... Would you like me to cheer for you? Or maybe dance, or sing? I-I'm sorry, I'm not sure what people prefer in these situations...
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_distraction]: Ah! Um, I wouldn't mind if you sang a song, Barbara. You have a lovely voice, and it might distract people, at least a little...

NAGISA STRIPPING PANTIES (revealing crotch):
Barbara [NagisaPanties2B]: Ah, hmm... ♫ <i>Resist, allow your heart to take you / Never let this merciless world erase you / The light of the torch shall guide you / And you will be bathed in the light!</i> ♫
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_song_strip]: ...

NAGISA STRIPPED PANTIES (revealed crotch):
Barbara [NagisaPanties3B]: <i>Hah...</i> There you go, Nagisa. I know it's embarrassing, and you might not like all the attention, but... Well, you're very beautiful, so it's difficult to look away.
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_thank_you]: Thanks for making this a bit easier for me, everyone. And I especially appreciate how positive you've been to~background.time~, Barbara. It helped me more than you might know.

---

BARBARA MUST STRIP HAT:
Barbara [NagisaHat1BReply]: I'm going to start my prayer now. Are you ready, Nagisa? <i>Ahem...</i> To the wind that guides me: When I'm exhausted, bless me with the strength to keep going forward.
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_prayer_amen]: Amen.

BARBARA STRIPPING HAT (accessory):
Barbara [NagisaHat2BReply]: When I'm uncertain, bless me with the wisdom to distinguish good from evil.
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_prayer_keep_going]: Oh, I wasn't supposed to talk yet! Sorry! Please, keep going.

BARBARA STRIPPED HAT (accessory):
Barbara [NagisaHat3BReply]: When I suffer from injustice, bless me with the courage to fight back... So, Nagisa? What do you think of our prayers?
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_prayer_end]: It was beautiful, Barbara. Sometimes I need the strength to keep going forward too. But I normally just promise myself a yummy lunch instead!


BARBARA MUST STRIP SHOES:
Barbara [NagisaShoes1BReply]: Do you have any interest in the Church of Favonius, Nagisa? I'm not sure what religion you follow, but I'd be happy to tell you more about mine if you like.
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_not_religious]: Is that the church you go to, Barbara? Some of my classmates go to a shrine for each new year, but it's usually too cold for me. And I've never been to a church before.

BARBARA STRIPPING SHOES (accessory):
Barbara [NagisaShoes2BReply]: The Church of Favonius is where I work, Nagisa. I lead the other nuns in prayer to the Anemo Archon Barbatos, much in the same way as the prayer you heard earlier.
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_prayer_inspired]: That prayer was really pretty! It made me feel like I could do anything to~background.time~.

BARBARA STRIPPED SHOES (accessory):
Barbara [NagisaShoes3BReply]: I'm happy to hear it. We in the Church espouse freedom more than anything -- the freedom to do whatever you like, no matter what. If I can inspire you, then I think I'm fulfilling my duty.
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_no_scold]: Does that mean they won't scold you for playing a game like this? That's very open-minded of them.


BARBARA MUST STRIP COLLAR:
Barbara [NagisaCollar1BReply]: I've told you of my religion, Nagisa, but what of yours? Are there any Gods you follow? Perhaps acts of divine intervention you've witnessed?
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_town_story]: My family isn't very religious, but I like hearing stories about the town. They say if you bring someone true happiness, an orb of light appears. And if enough orbs of light appear, a wish can be granted.

BARBARA STRIPPING COLLAR (minor):
Barbara [NagisaCollar2BReply]: Oh, that sounds so lovely! The town itself reacting to the happiness of its inhabitants... Everybody where you live must be so kind.
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_nobody_to_ask]: That must be it. I've always wondered why. I have so many questions about that sort of thing, but there's nobody to ask.

BARBARA STRIPPED COLLAR (minor):
Barbara [NagisaCollar3BReply]: Is there some kind of deity your worship, Nagisa? Whenever I'm unsure about something, I always pray to Barbatos above for guidance.
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_no_one_to_pray_to]: No, I don't have anyone I can pray too at all. Sometimes I wish I did, though.


BARBARA MUST STRIP DRESS:
Barbara [NagisaDress1BReply]: O-Oh, it's come down to this... Truthfully, I didn't just come here to spread joy. I-Idols have their desires too, you see...
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_desires]: Oh, I see. Um, you should know that's totally normal for a young woman. Even I.. when I'm talking to someone handsome... even I have thoughts like that. Sometimes.

BARBARA STRIPPING DRESS (major):
Barbara [NagisaDress2BReply]: That's right, Nagisa. I think these desires are completely normal when you're our age. But... idols are treated a little differently when it comes to matters like this.
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_busybodies]: Oh. Yeah, there are a lot of magazines that are just busybodies into the lives of famous girls. Not that I read magazines like that.

BARBARA STRIPPED DRESS (major):
Barbara [NagisaDress3BReply]: Ah, yes... "Tabloids," I believe Alice called them. Still, don't you think this is just wonderful? A place where everybody can be themselves, free from judgement or ridicule...
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_side_of_yourself]: I never thought of it like that. This is somewhere where you can show a side of yourself that not even you've seen.


BARBARA MUST STRIP BRA:
Barbara [NagisaBra1BReply]: T-This is a little embarrassing... I want to explore myself, but I've never done anything like this in front of strangers. If you don't mind, Nagisa... could you cheer for me?
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_early_forfeit]: Um, I can cheer for you... But you should really wait to explore yourself until it's time for the forfeit! You don't need to do it early in front of everyone...

BARBARA STRIPPING BRA (revealing chest):
Barbara [NagisaBra2BReply]: T-That's not what I meant... Mondstadt is the city of freedom, but I've never shown myself off to others like this. I-It's nerve-wracking, but also very exciting...
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_explorers]: Oh! We're the explorers, and you're the... hills? That's a pretty metaphor, I think. It's kind of a bit rude too... but that makes sense for this kind of game.

BARBARA STRIPPED BRA (revealed chest):
Barbara [NagisaBra3BReply]: I-I don't think you could say that I have <i>hills</i>, but I hope you enjoy the view all the same...
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_path_metaphor]: The path to my school might seem insignificant to some people, but it's still one of the most beautiful places I know.


BARBARA MUST STRIP PANTYHOSE:
Barbara [NagisaPantyhose1BReply]: W-Well, this is it... Barbara baring it all for all of you. I-I hope this excites you as much as it excites me...
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_prayer_success]: Your prayers came true, Barbara. I'm so happy for you. If your fans were here, I'm sure they'd be cheering you all the way too.

BARBARA STRIPPING PANTYHOSE (revealing crotch):
Barbara [NagisaPantyhose2BReply]: T-Thank you, Nagisa... I'm glad I can count on your support. A-And, um, when it comes down to it, I hope you'll be cheering for me then, too.
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_then_that]: "Then"? Oh! Um, I can if you want me to. I've never cheered on a girl while she did <i>that</i> before...

BARBARA STRIPPED PANTYHOSE (revealed crotch):
Barbara [NagisaPantyhose3BReply]: T-That's okay, um... Just put your heart into it. If I could put on a performance that makes you happy, that would make me happy too.
Nagisa [nagisa_barbara_something_special]: If you're willing to share something so special with us, then we'll just have to be the most appreciative audience you've ever had.
