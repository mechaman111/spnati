                <state img="#-happy.png">If ya haven't heard of me, that's alright! I never heard of La Dragonesa 'til she kicked my butt! But don't worry, I'm not gonna kick &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; butts!</state>
                <state img="#-disappointed.png">If ya haven't heard of me... well, I don't blame ya. It's hard to get famous, man!</state>

                <state img="#-laugh.png">Heh heh! This plan is brilliant! None of y'all will be able to forget me or my band once ya see me naked, and y'all won't be able to resist tellin' your friends! It's the best marketing campaign in the &lt;i&gt;world&lt;/i&gt;!</state>

                <state img="#-laugh.png">Good thing y'all got &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; and not Elevator Girl! She's all stoic and stuff. &lt;i&gt;Totally&lt;/i&gt; not fun to hang around. Plus, she doesn't even have elevator powers. Lame!</state>
                <state img="#-laugh.png">Good thing y'all got &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; and not, like, Dr. Worm or something! He's not a real doctor but he &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a real worm -- like, an &lt;i&gt;actual&lt;/i&gt; worm! I've seen him in person! He's crazy!</state>
                <state img="#-disappointed.png">Good thing y'all got &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; and not, like... John Flansburgh!... Nah, that's not true. Even &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; wish I were John Flansburgh instead...</state>
                <state img="#-laugh.png">I got a real good feelin' about this match! Even if there's no prize, I got a feelin' that we won't be crashin' in my uncle's RV tonight!</state>
                <state img="#-disgust.png">It's me, Critical Darling. &lt;i&gt;Yes, the one that got beat by La Dragonesa...&lt;/i&gt; But hey, I beat a buncha dudes &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; losin' to her!</state>
                <state img="#-wink.png">Me: Critical Darling. My band: Melting Dreamscape. You: Probably gonna see me naked, but probably also gonna see my band play after this.</state>
                <state img="#-laugh.png">On a scale from Gilgamesh to Hammurabi, I'm feelin' pretty Hammurabi right now! Let's get this show on the road!</state>
                <state img="#-confused.png">Hey, real quick, in case you're wonderin', these things hangin' off my skirt here? They're suspenders. A lotta people don't get that for some reason.</state>
                <state img="#-wink.png">Y'all are gonna get to see just how good with my fingers I am! Cuz I suck at poker... But I do got guitar skills!</state>
                <state img="#-disappointed.png">Any chance the winner of this will get a golden fiddle?... No?... Well, at least I'm not bettin' my soul either...</state>
                <state img="#-excited.png">I'll take your bet, and you're gonna regret, cuz I'm the best there's ever been!</state>
