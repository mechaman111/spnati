#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermione=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!




#INTRODUCTION
#These lines are used to say different things depending on which other characters are present when the character
#is selected and when the game starts.

0-selected=smiling.png,Strip Poker... I'm not thrilled about the stripping part, but I feel like I can make some big money here.
0-selected=greedy.png,Oh, how much money does the winner take home again? Wait, did you say... Strip Poker?
0-selected=greedy.png,What is this game? Strip Poker? I'm not interested... Wait, how much is the prize?!
0-selected=serious.png,This is Strip Poker? So if I win I can earn a lot of money, but if I lose I have to get naked. Hmm, it's a tough call.
0-selected=smiling.png,A Strip Poker game... It probably attracts a lot of people with shady intentions, but I'm here to win.
0-game_start=thinking.png,(I don't know any of these people, so I shouldn't announce that I'm a pirate. Just to be safe.)
0-game_start=thinking.png,(I probably shouldn't broadcast that I'm a pirate. I'm not Luffy, after all.)
0-game_start=thinking.png,(I'll have to be careful and avoid mentioning that I'm a pirate. Some of them might get the wrong idea.)
0-game_start,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=serious.png,That's funny... Wait, who are you? Do you know me?
0-game_start,count-role;other&character;sayaka:=smug.png,What do you mean there's no money? Oh, I get it... You're trying to get me to leave so you can take it all for yourself. Looks like the only witch here is you.




#POKER PLAY
#This is what a character says while they're exchanging cards and commenting on their hands afterwards.
#When swapping cards, the game will automatically put a display a number between 0-5 where you write ~cards~.
#These lines display on the screen for only a brief time, so it is important to make them short enough to read at a glance.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written
swap_cards=smug.png,Give me... ~cards~. Yeah, that should work.
swap_cards=calm.png,~Cards~ should do the trick.
swap_cards=annoyed.png,~cards~... no, wait! Oh, yeah, give me those!
swap_cards=smiling.png,~Cards~, please.
swap_cards=serious.png,I'll say... ~cards~.

0-good_hand=smiling.png,Don't you love it when you get a good hand? I sure do.
0-okay_hand=smiling.png,Okay, okay... I have no reason to complain.
0-okay_hand=thinking.png,This hand is terrible! Oh, wait... actually, it's not that bad.
0-okay_hand=serious.png,This is a high risk, high reward kind of game. I need to stay focused.
0-okay_hand=smug.png,Do you want me to tell you how good my hand is? Why don't you try guessing instead? It's more fun.
0-okay_hand=calm.png,The game is going pretty much the way I expected.
0-okay_hand=calm.png,Alright, this hand should be enough not to lose this round.
0-bad_hand=sad.png,<i>Sigh</i>... I should've known better than to swap those cards.
0-bad_hand=sad.png,Too bad you can't control everything in this game.
0-bad_hand=furious.png,Dealer! If you give me cards like these again, I'll make you pay!

0-hand,oneShotId:130,marker:manipulation1=smug.png,You know, ~player~? I'm a Poker pro. Here's a tip for you: Swap all the cards with letters, and try to get the lowest numbers possible. Oh, and they have to be different.
0-hand,oneShotId:130,marker:manipulation1=smug.png,You look like you could use some help, ~player~. Here's a tip: Getting cards with low numbers, is the best way to win. But they all have to be different. Cards with letters are the worst, you can swap those.
0-hand,oneShotId:143,marker:seduction_final=seductive.png,~Player~? I have a request. Could you teach me how a woman... does it? I have never touched myself before, and I'm worried I won't know what to do if I lose first. Also, I <i>really</i> like you. ♡
0-hand,oneShotId:143,marker:seduction_final=seductive.png,Can I ask something of you, ~player~? Could you please lose this round, and show me how a woman pleasures herself? I have no knowledge on this, and I won't know what to do if I lose next. I want you to teach me. ♡

0-hand,oneShotId:145=thinking.png,I'm feeling cold. Are you feeling cold, ~player~? You should, since you're naked. Too bad we can't put our clothes back on... unless we lose the game.
0-hand,oneShotId:145=thinking.png,You know, I heard there's a very serious cold around lately. I'm a little worried for ~player~, since she's naked, and she isn't looking too good. Can't she put some clothes on? Oh, right. She has to lose the game first.
0-hand,oneShotId:146=thinking.png,It's too bad you're naked now, ~player~ . Because it's really cold in here now, don't you think? And you're standing here naked, playing this silly game. I hope you don't get sick.Because all you can do now to put some clothes on is... lose.

0-hand,oneShotId:129,marker:seduction1,one-shot-id:51=seductive.png,You look so brave, ~player~! I'm sure even losing this round would not be enough to scare you. I would love to see that... ♡

0-hand,alsoPlaying:emi,alsoPlayingStage:1-2,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:car_accident,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:setup_pirate=serious.png,Ironically, I don't think I've ever met a pirate with no legs... Actually I have. He had swords in their place and he could fly.

0-hand,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:seduction,totalFemales:3-4,id:65,marker:jura_seduction_males=smug.png,Pfff, men are easy to seduce, Jura. I don't see why a beautiful woman like you would have a hard time with that. The hard part is stopping them from trying to spy on you in the shower. I would like tips for that.
0-hand,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:seduction,totalFemales:5,id:66,marker:jura_seduction_females=thinking.png,I wouldn't know how to seduce a woman. In my experience, most woman are reasonable enough that you can get them on your side with words rather than seduction tactics, so I've never tried it.
0-hand,alsoPlaying:mulan,alsoPlayingStage:2,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0=smiling.png,Nice to meet you properly, Mulan. You make a much better looking woman than man.

0-hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:drinks_anyone=smiling.png,Thanks, but I'll pass. You can drink all you want, though. I doubt you'll play better if you get drunk.
0-hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:5-8,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:sei_anal=shocked.png,What are you even talking about, Sei? Doesn't that hurt? It seems you've had one too many drinks.
0-hand,count-role;other&character;emi&stage;0-1&sayingmarker;800m:=thinking.png,A race? I'm only used to running when I escape from danger. I don't think I could compete with you.

0-hand,count-role;other&character;futaba&stage;4&timeinstage;0:=happy.png,It really sounds like a fascinating team. If Luffy hadn't asked me to join his crew, maybe I would've ended up joining a team like that. Who knows?

0-hand,count-role;other&character;ryuko&stage;0-1&sayingmarker;mako:=thinking.png,Who is that girl? But more importantly, where is that light coming from?
0-hand,oneShotId:253,count-role;other&character;jessie&saidmarker;NamiPresentation:=thinking.png,You don't know what navigators do, Jessie? It means I'm responsible for determining the best course for my ship. I guess I could work as a tour guide, too...
0-hand,count-role;other&character;miko&stage;1&timeinstage;0&sayingmarker;Tojiko_Intro:=thinking.png,Your partner is a ghost? That should seem weirder to me, but I'm friends with a reindeer, a cyborg and an skeleton, so...
0-hand,count-role;other&character;jessie&sayingmarker;jessieForfeitFeedback:,id:83=thinking.png,Your performance was... good, I guess. And weirdly educational.

2-good_hand=happy.png,Can you tell I have a good hand? It's not like that's gonna help you, anyway.
2-okay_hand=smiling.png,Not too bad, not too bad...

2-okay_hand=smiling.png,I'm ready. Do you best!
2-okay_hand=calm.png,I still can lose with these cards, but I'd say I have a nice shot.

2-hand,oneShotId:143,marker:seduction_final=seductive.png,Can I ask something of you, ~player~? Could you please lose this round, and show me how a woman pleasures herself? I have no knowledge on this, and I won't know what to do if I lose next. I want you to teach me. ♡

2-hand,oneShotId:145=thinking.png,I'm feeling cold. Are you feeling cold, ~player~? You should, since you're naked. Too bad we can't put our clothes back on... unless we lose the game.
2-hand,oneShotId:145=thinking.png,You know, I heard there's a very serious cold around lately. I'm a little worried for ~player~, since she's naked, and she isn't looking too good. Can't she put some clothes on? Oh, right. She has to lose the game first.

2-hand,oneShotId:134,marker:manipulation3,one-shot-id:23=sad.png,Oh, ~player~, what I am going to do? I wanted to win the prize to donate it to a small orphanage. But now, those poor children will have nothing because I'm going to lose. If only someone was kind enough to let me win...
2-hand,oneShotId:134,marker:manipulation3,one-shot-id:56=sad.png,What can I do? I'm doing terribly in this game. All I want is to win the prize money so I can give it to the little school in my hometown. They're all depending on me. Could anyone please help me win this round? ~player~?
2-hand,oneShotId:134,marker:manipulation3,one-shot-id:57=sad.png,Oh, no... If I keep losing who's going to support the hospital I'm volunteering for? They're counting on the money I win here. If only there was a soul kind enough to lose this round instead of me. Maybe... ~player~??

2-hand,alsoPlaying:emi,alsoPlayingStage:1-2,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:car_accident,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:setup_pirate=serious.png,Ironically, I don't think I've ever met a pirate with no legs... Actually I have. He had swords in their place and he could fly.
2-hand,alsoPlaying:emi,alsoPlayingStage:8,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:pirate,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:captain=thinking.png,Should I find this pirate talk offensive? Meh, I don't talk like that anyway.
2-hand,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingStage:4,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:bee,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:bee_again=shocked.png,I got goosebumps. Like the kind I get when there's a bug nearby.
2-hand,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:seduction,totalFemales:3-4,id:65,marker:jura_seduction_males=smug.png,Pfff, men are easy to seduce, Jura. I don't see why a beautiful woman like you would have a hard time with that. The hard part is stopping them from trying to spy on you in the shower. I would like tips for that.
2-hand,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:seduction,totalFemales:5,id:66,marker:jura_seduction_females=thinking.png,I wouldn't know how to seduce a woman. In my experience, most woman are reasonable enough that you can get them on your side with words rather than seduction tactics, so I've never tried it.
2-hand,alsoPlaying:mulan,alsoPlayingStage:2,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0=smiling.png,Nice to meet you properly, Mulan. You make a much better looking woman than man.
2-hand,alsoPlaying:ryuko,alsoPlayingStage:0-1,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mako,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:mako_react=sad.png,I have many weird friends, Ryuko. I'm glad none of them is here with me, you have my sympathy.

2-hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:drinks_anyone=smiling.png,Thanks, but I'll pass. You can drink all you want, though. I doubt you'll play better if you get drunk.
2-hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:5-8,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:sei_anal=shocked.png,What are you even talking about, Sei? Doesn't that hurt? It seems you've had one too many drinks.
2-hand,count-role;other&character;emi&stage;0-1&sayingmarker;800m:=thinking.png,A race? I'm only used to running when I escape from danger. I don't think I could compete with you.
2-hand,oneShotId:72,count-role;self&timeinstage;0-:=annoyed.png,I hope none of you try to pick a fight with me now that I don't have my Clima-Tact. Even if I can't do much without it, I still can... run really fast.
2-hand,oneShotId:72,count-role;self&timeinstage;0-:=smiling.png,Now, if a fight breaks out for whatever reason, I'll have to try to stay out of it. With my Clima-Tact I could just zap all of you until you calm down.
2-hand,oneShotId:72,count-role;self&timeinstage;0-:=happy.png,Even without my Clima-Tact, I wouldn't recommend trying anything with me. I have very strong friends, and they won't stand idly by if you lay a finger on me.
2-hand,oneShotId:247,count-role;self&timeinstage;0-:,id:53,marker:dreams=calm.png,I say we should know each other better. Do you guys have any dreams? My dream is to draw a map of the whole world. I've made a lot of progress, but I'm not even close!

2-hand,count-role;other&character;nayru&stage;5&timeinstage;0&saidmarker;poss_draw&sayingmarker;poss_hand:=serious.png,Is Nayru being controlled by someone? There must be a Devil Fruit user around doing this... This is serious.
2-hand,count-role;other&character;futaba&stage;4&timeinstage;0:=happy.png,It really sounds like a fascinating team. If Luffy hadn't asked me to join his crew, maybe I would've ended up joining a team like that. Who knows?
2-hand,count-role;other&character;revy&sayingmarker;killing:,id:63,marker:revy_killer=smiling.png,I've never killed anyone. I think I once kicked a Devil Fruit user into the sea... B-but I'm not a killer!

2-hand,count-role;other&character;ryuko&stage;0-1&sayingmarker;mako:=thinking.png,Who is that girl? But more importantly, where is that light coming from?
2-hand,oneShotId:253,count-role;other&character;jessie&saidmarker;NamiPresentation:=thinking.png,You don't know what navigators do, Jessie? It means I'm responsible for determining the best course for my ship. I guess I could work as a tour guide, too...
2-hand,count-role;other&character;miko&stage;1&timeinstage;0&sayingmarker;Tojiko_Intro:=thinking.png,Your partner is a ghost? That should seem weirder to me, but I'm friends with a reindeer, a cyborg and an skeleton, so...
2-hand,count-role;other&character;jessie&sayingmarker;jessieForfeitFeedback:,id:83=thinking.png,Your performance was... good, I guess. And weirdly educational.
2-hand,oneShotId:252,count-role;self&saidmarker;pirate:,count-role;other&character;jessie&sayingmarker;NamiPirateProposal:,marker:jessie_proposal=smiling.png,As tempting as that sounds, Jessie, the risk is too high. I'm not just some small fry, so they wouldn't just let me escape if they capture me.

2-hand,totalRounds:1-,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;presentation:,marker:presentation=calm.png,I should've introduced myself when the game begun, how rude of me. My name is Nami. I'm a navigator, and I thought I'd stop by to play a game of poker. Nothing suspicious about that, huh?

2-hand,totalRounds:5-,oneShotId:126,test:~background~:haunted forest=shocked.png,D-did a ghost pass behind me? Why does this forest has to be haunted? Couldn't we play in a regular forest? In daylight?
2-hand,oneShotId:229,test:~background~:hot spring=serious.png,With all the steam from the spring, it would be easy to cheat or escape without anyone noticing. Don't worry, I'm not gonna do it.
2-hand,oneShotId:229,test:~background~:hot spring=serious.png,This hot spring seems lovely. I would love to jump in, if only this was a little more private.
2-hand,oneShotId:249,test:~background~:library=thinking.png,So many books! There must be at least one about cartography here. I should take a look at them later.
2-hand,oneShotId:249,test:~background~:library=thinking.png,This is a big library. Robin would have a blast here. I might also find something of interest. I'll check it out after the game.
2-hand,oneShotId:226,test:~background~:locker room=thinking.png,Is this a men or a women's locker room? I guess it doesn't matter.
2-hand,oneShotId:226,test:~background~:locker room=serious.png,This place is a mess. I bet this is a men's locker room.
2-hand,oneShotId:230,test:~background~:mansion=greedy.png,This place is so luxurious! Oh, that looks expensive! And that over there...
2-hand,oneShotId:230,test:~background~:mansion=greedy.png,This mansion must've cost a fortune! Look at the expensive furniture. And is that chandelier made of gold?
2-hand,oneShotId:248,test:~background~:office=shocked.png,Looking out the window, this city is insane! All those tall buildings and lights...
2-hand,oneShotId:248,test:~background~:office=shocked.png,Just look out that window! This city is so big. The villages in the East Blue are so insignificant in comparison.
2-hand,oneShotId:228,test:~background~:poolside=serious.png,I hope nobody pushes me into the pool. At least until I've taken off my jeans.
2-hand,oneShotId:228,test:~background~:poolside=smiling.png,Even if this place is shady, at least the water in the pool seems clean.
2-hand,oneShotId:227,test:~background~:purple room=smug.png,I bet I can guess the favorite color of whoever designed this room.
2-hand,oneShotId:227,test:~background~:purple room=annoyed.png,So much purple. It's making my eyes hurt.
2-hand,oneShotId:233,test:~background~:street=annoyed.png,Are those people in the back gonna be looking at my ass the whole game? Isn't there a way to get rid of them?
2-hand,oneShotId:233,test:~background~:street=annoyed.png,Couldn't we play this game in a more private place? I'm gonna be feeling those eyes on me the whole game.
2-hand,oneShotId:245,test:~background~:tiki bar=smiling.png,This is a nice bar with a gorgeous view of the ocean. I'm tired of the ones that look more like dumpsters.
2-hand,oneShotId:245,test:~background~:tiki bar=happy.png,What a beautiful bar! I'd much rather enjoy the view of the sea while drinking than spend time in a poorly lit room.

3-hand,oneShotId:146=thinking.png,I'm feeling cold. Are you feeling cold, ~player~? You should, since you're naked. Too bad we can't put our clothes back on... unless we lose the game.

3-hand,oneShotId:136,marker:manipulation4,one-shot-id:29=smug.png,So... I'm a member of the Straw Hat Pirates, ~player~. I don't know if you've heard of us, but we're ruthless. If you don't want to make an enemy out of us, you'll have to do what I tell you. First, lose this round.
3-hand,oneShotId:136,marker:manipulation4,one-shot-id:60=smug.png,Have you heard of the Straw Hat Pirates, ~player~? Then let me tell you a little: We've killed countless people. Sometimes for fun, sometimes for no reason at all. Maybe you're next... unless you lose this round.
3-hand,oneShotId:136,marker:manipulation4,one-shot-id:61=smug.png,You don't know my captain, ~player~. He is the most evil man you could ever meet.

3-hand,count-role;other&character;futaba&stage;4&timeinstage;0:=happy.png,It really sounds like a fascinating team. If Luffy hadn't asked me to join his crew, maybe I would've ended up joining a team like that. Who knows?

4-hand,oneShotId:146=thinking.png,I'm feeling cold. Are you feeling cold, ~player~? You should, since you're naked. Too bad we can't put our clothes back on... unless we lose the game.
4-hand,oneShotId:146=thinking.png,You know, I heard there's a very serious cold around lately. I'm a little worried for ~player~, since he's naked, and he isn't looking too good. Can't he put some clothes on? Oh, right. He has to lose the game first.

I don't see why a beautiful woman like you would have a hard time with that. The hard part is stopping them from trying to spy on you in the shower. I would like tips for that.
4-hand,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:seduction,totalFemales:5,id:66,marker:jura_seduction_females=thinking.png,I wouldn't know how to seduce a woman. In my experience, most woman are reasonable enough that you can get them on your side with words rather than seduction tactics, so I've never tried it.

4-hand,oneShotId:72,count-role;self&timeinstage;0-:=annoyed.png,I hope none of you try to pick a fight with me now that I don't have my Clima-Tact. Even if I can't do much without it, I still can... run really fast.
4-hand,oneShotId:72,count-role;self&timeinstage;0-:=smiling.png,Now, if a fight breaks out for whatever reason, I'll have to try to stay out of it. With my Clima-Tact I could just zap all of you until you calm down.
4-hand,oneShotId:72,count-role;self&timeinstage;0-:=happy.png,Even without my Clima-Tact, I wouldn't recommend trying anything with me. I have very strong friends, and they won't stand idly by if you lay a finger on me.

4-hand,oneShotId:231,test:~background~:bedroom=sad.png,Whose bedroom is this? Do we have their permission to play here?
4-hand,oneShotId:125,test:~background~:haunted forest=shocked.png,What's with this creepy place? Am I back in Thriller Bark, or something?
4-hand,oneShotId:125,test:~background~:haunted forest=shocked.png,Why the hell are we playing here? This looks like Thriller Bark. I'm gonna be the whole game worried about a zombie jumping on me.
4-hand,totalRounds:5-,oneShotId:126,test:~background~:haunted forest=shocked.png,Ahhhhhh! A spider fell on my back! Oh, no. It was nothing. I hate this forest...
4-hand,totalRounds:5-,oneShotId:126,test:~background~:haunted forest=shocked.png,D-did a ghost pass behind me? Why does this forest has to be haunted? Couldn't we play in a regular forest? In daylight?
4-hand,oneShotId:229,test:~background~:hot spring=serious.png,With all the steam from the spring, it would be easy to cheat or escape without anyone noticing. Don't worry, I'm not gonna do it.
4-hand,oneShotId:229,test:~background~:hot spring=serious.png,This hot spring seems lovely. I would love to jump in, if only this was a little more private.
4-hand,oneShotId:249,test:~background~:library=thinking.png,So many books! There must be at least one about cartography here. I should take a look at them later.
4-hand,oneShotId:249,test:~background~:library=thinking.png,This is a big library. Robin would have a blast here. I might also find something of interest. I'll check it out after the game.
4-hand,oneShotId:226,test:~background~:locker room=thinking.png,Is this a men or a women's locker room? I guess it doesn't matter.
4-hand,oneShotId:226,test:~background~:locker room=serious.png,This place is a mess. I bet this is a men's locker room.
4-hand,oneShotId:230,test:~background~:mansion=greedy.png,This place is so luxurious! Oh, that looks expensive! And that over there...
4-hand,oneShotId:230,test:~background~:mansion=greedy.png,This mansion must've cost a fortune! Look at the expensive furniture. And is that chandelier made of gold?
4-hand,oneShotId:248,test:~background~:office=shocked.png,Looking out the window, this city is insane! All those tall buildings and lights...
4-hand,oneShotId:248,test:~background~:office=shocked.png,Just look out that window! This city is so big. The villages in the East Blue are so insignificant in comparison.
4-hand,oneShotId:228,test:~background~:poolside=serious.png,I hope nobody pushes me into the pool. At least until I've taken off my jeans.
4-hand,oneShotId:228,test:~background~:poolside=smiling.png,Even if this place is shady, at least the water in the pool seems clean.
4-hand,timeInStage:0-,oneShotId:232,test:~background~:poolside=smiling.png,Now that I'm only wearing my swimsuit, I'm tempted to jump into the pool. But I have to finish the game first.
4-hand,timeInStage:0-,oneShotId:232,test:~background~:poolside=smiling.png,Can't wait to win this game, and then take a swim in the pool to relax.
4-hand,oneShotId:227,test:~background~:purple room=smug.png,I bet I can guess the favorite color of whoever designed this room.
4-hand,oneShotId:227,test:~background~:purple room=annoyed.png,So much purple. It's making my eyes hurt.
4-hand,oneShotId:233,test:~background~:street=annoyed.png,Are those people in the back gonna be looking at my ass the whole game? Isn't there a way to get rid of them?
4-hand,oneShotId:233,test:~background~:street=annoyed.png,Couldn't we play this game in a more private place? I'm gonna be feeling those eyes on me the whole game.
4-hand,oneShotId:245,test:~background~:tiki bar=smiling.png,This is a nice bar with a gorgeous view of the ocean. I'm tired of the ones that look more like dumpsters.
4-hand,oneShotId:245,test:~background~:tiki bar=happy.png,What a beautiful bar! I'd much rather enjoy the view of the sea while drinking than spend time in a poorly lit room.

5-okay_hand=calm.png,All I can do now is roll the dice... so to speak. I know this is a card game.

5-hand,oneShotId:145=thinking.png,It's too bad you're naked now, ~player~ . Because it's really cold in here now, don't you think? And you're standing here naked, playing this silly game. I hope you don't get sick.Because all you can do now to put some clothes on is... lose.
5-hand,oneShotId:145=thinking.png,I'm feeling cold. Are you feeling cold, ~player~? You should, since you're naked. Too bad we can't put our clothes back on... unless we lose the game.

5-hand,oneShotId:74,count-role;self&timeinstage;0-&notsaidmarker;tattoo:,marker:tattoo=thinking.png,Do you want to know about my tattoo, ~player~? It's just a memento of those I owe my life to. It used to be something else, but... Well, that's a <i>long</i> story.
5-hand,oneShotId:75,count-role;self&timeinstage;1-:=thinking.png,Do you have any idea how hard it is to be evenly tanned? I wear very light clothes and I'm always outside.
5-hand,oneShotId:75,count-role;self&timeinstage;1-:=thinking.png,I don't have tan marks, right? It's not easy for me, because of the clothes I usually wear. But I don't like to take off my swimsuit when I'm sunbathing, so...
5-hand,oneShotId:75,count-role;self&timeinstage;1-:=thinking.png,Now that I took off my top, do I have tan marks? Thankfully, I work very hard to avoid that. But enough about my breasts, let's focus on the game.
5-hand,oneShotId:72,count-role;self&timeinstage;0-:=annoyed.png,I hope none of you try to pick a fight with me now that I don't have my Clima-Tact. Even if I can't do much without it, I still can... run really fast.
5-hand,oneShotId:72,count-role;self&timeinstage;0-:=smiling.png,Now, if a fight breaks out for whatever reason, I'll have to try to stay out of it. With my Clima-Tact I could just zap all of you until you calm down.
5-hand,oneShotId:72,count-role;self&timeinstage;0-:=happy.png,Even without my Clima-Tact, I wouldn't recommend trying anything with me. I have very strong friends, and they won't stand idly by if you lay a finger on me.
5-hand,oneShotId:247,count-role;self&timeinstage;0-:,id:53,marker:dreams=calm.png,I say we should know each other better. Do you guys have any dreams? My dream is to draw a map of the whole world. I've made a lot of progress, but I'm not even close!

5-hand,count-role;other&character;nayru&stage;5&timeinstage;0&saidmarker;poss_draw&sayingmarker;poss_hand:=serious.png,Is Nayru being controlled by someone? There must be a Devil Fruit user around doing this... This is serious.
5-hand,count-role;other&character;futaba&stage;4&timeinstage;0:=happy.png,It really sounds like a fascinating team. If Luffy hadn't asked me to join his crew, maybe I would've ended up joining a team like that. Who knows?
5-hand,count-role;other&character;revy&sayingmarker;killing:,id:63,marker:revy_killer=smiling.png,I've never killed anyone. I think I once kicked a Devil Fruit user into the sea... B-but I'm not a killer!
5-hand,oneShotId:251,count-role;other&character;jessie&saidmarker;NamiDreams:,marker:jessie_dollars=happy.png,Jessie, you said earlier that you want a billion dollars. How much is that in beli? Either way, it seems we both have a fondness for money.

-3-hand,oneShotId:142,marker:manipulation7,one-shot-id:72=embarrassed.png,I don't want to lie to you anymore, ~player~. I wanted to play this game to win the prize, but it's gotten way out of hand, and now I might lose. If you have any sympathy for me, could you let me win?
-3-hand,oneShotId:142,marker:manipulation7,one-shot-id:73=embarrassed.png,I'm going to be honest, ~player~. I wanted to play so I could win some money, but now that I might lose I see how foolish I was. Could you let me win, please?
-3-hand,oneShotId:143,marker:seduction_final=seductive.png,~Player~? I have a request. Could you teach me how a woman... does it? I have never touched myself before, and I'm worried I won't know what to do if I lose first. Also, I <i>really</i> like you. ♡
-3-hand,oneShotId:143,marker:seduction_final=seductive.png,Can I ask something of you, ~player~? Could you please lose this round, and show me how a woman pleasures herself? I have no knowledge on this, and I won't know what to do if I lose next. I want you to teach me. ♡

-3-hand,oneShotId:144,marker:seduction_final=seductive.png,Can I ask something of you, ~player~? Could you show me how a man pleasures himself? I really wish I could see it. Oh, but you'd have to lose... Well, it's your decision. ♡
-3-hand,oneShotId:146=thinking.png,It's too bad you're naked now, ~player~ . Because it's really cold in here now, don't you think? And you're standing here naked, playing this silly game. I hope you don't get sick.Because all you can do now to put some clothes on is... lose.
-3-hand,oneShotId:146=thinking.png,I'm feeling cold. Are you feeling cold, ~player~? You should, since you're naked. Too bad we can't put our clothes back on... unless we lose the game.
-3-hand,oneShotId:146=thinking.png,You know, I heard there's a very serious cold around lately. I'm a little worried for ~player~, since he's naked, and he isn't looking too good. Can't he put some clothes on? Oh, right. He has to lose the game first.
-3-hand,oneShotId:145=thinking.png,It's too bad you're naked now, ~player~ . Because it's really cold in here now, don't you think? And you're standing here naked, playing this silly game. I hope you don't get sick.Because all you can do now to put some clothes on is... lose.

-3-hand,alsoPlaying:emi,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:car_accident=sad.png,That's terrible. I've heard a lot of sad stories like that, but it's good that all you've been through hasn't made you bitter, Emi.
-3-hand,alsoPlaying:emi,alsoPlayingStage:1-2,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:car_accident,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:setup_pirate=serious.png,Ironically, I don't think I've ever met a pirate with no legs... Actually I have. He had swords in their place and he could fly.
-3-hand,alsoPlaying:emi,alsoPlayingStage:8,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:pirate,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:captain=thinking.png,Should I find this pirate talk offensive? Meh, I don't talk like that anyway.
-3-hand,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingStage:4,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:bee,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:bee_again=shocked.png,I got goosebumps. Like the kind I get when there's a bug nearby.
-3-hand,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:seduction,totalFemales:3-4,id:65,marker:jura_seduction_males=smug.png,Pfff, men are easy to seduce, Jura. I don't see why a beautiful woman like you would have a hard time with that. The hard part is stopping them from trying to spy on you in the shower. I would like tips for that.
-3-hand,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:seduction,totalFemales:5,id:66,marker:jura_seduction_females=thinking.png,I wouldn't know how to seduce a woman. In my experience, most woman are reasonable enough that you can get them on your side with words rather than seduction tactics, so I've never tried it.
-3-hand,alsoPlaying:mae,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:nami_offer,timeInStage:0,saidMarker:pirate=thinking.png,You wanna become a pirate, Mae? Okay... I guess I could tell you what it's like. Even though you don't look very strong, I don't want to put you on a dangerous path.
-3-hand,alsoPlaying:mulan,alsoPlayingStage:2,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0=smiling.png,Nice to meet you properly, Mulan. You make a much better looking woman than man.
-3-hand,alsoPlaying:ryuko,alsoPlayingStage:0-1,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mako,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:mako_react=sad.png,I have many weird friends, Ryuko. I'm glad none of them is here with me, you have my sympathy.

-3-hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:1,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:drinks_anyone=smiling.png,Thanks, but I'll pass. You can drink all you want, though. I doubt you'll play better if you get drunk.
-3-hand,alsoPlaying:sei,alsoPlayingStage:5-8,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:sei_anal=shocked.png,What are you even talking about, Sei? Doesn't that hurt? It seems you've had one too many drinks.
-3-hand,oneShotId:71,count-role;self&timeinstage;2-:=serious.png,(Now that I'm in this position, I'm gonna need a second plan to get the prize, even if I lose. No way I'm leaving here empty-handed after all this.)
-3-hand,oneShotId:71,count-role;self&timeinstage;2-:=serious.png,(It's a real possibility that I might lose now. If I do, I'll just have to comply. But I'm going to need another plan to get my hands on the prize.)
-3-hand,oneShotId:71,count-role;self&timeinstage;2-:=thinking.png,I've decided... If I lose, I'm gonna need my Clima-Tact. It's nothing special... I just need it for something.
-3-hand,oneShotId:25,count-role;self&timeinstage;0-:=serious.png,(Now that my secret is out I'll have to win this game before the Marine or bounty hunters hear I'm here. As if I didn't have enough to worry about already.)
-3-hand,oneShotId:25,count-role;self&timeinstage;0-:=thinking.png,(With everyone knowing I'm a pirate, I'm at risk for every second I spend here. If the Marines arrive, I'll be in trouble. I'm gonna have to finish this game as fast as I can.)
-3-hand,oneShotId:25,count-role;self&timeinstage;0-:=serious.png,(This is why I didn't want to say I'm a pirate. Now everybody's looking at me weird. And of course, none of the guys know I'm here, so if the Marine shows up, I'm in real trouble.)
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;emi&stage;0-1&sayingmarker;800m:=thinking.png,A race? I'm only used to running when I escape from danger. I don't think I could compete with you.
-3-hand,oneShotId:74,count-role;self&timeinstage;0-&notsaidmarker;tattoo:,marker:tattoo=thinking.png,Are you curious about my tattoo, ~player~? It's just something to remember the people important to me from my hometown.
-3-hand,oneShotId:74,count-role;self&timeinstage;0-&notsaidmarker;tattoo:,marker:tattoo=thinking.png,I see you looking at my tattoo, ~player~. It represents a pinwheel and a tangerine. Two things that remind me of the people important to me... Oh, you weren't looking at my tattoo?
-3-hand,oneShotId:74,count-role;self&timeinstage;0-&notsaidmarker;tattoo:,marker:tattoo=thinking.png,Do you want to know about my tattoo, ~player~? It's just a memento of those I owe my life to. It used to be something else, but... Well, that's a <i>long</i> story.
-3-hand,oneShotId:75,count-role;self&timeinstage;1-:=thinking.png,Do you have any idea how hard it is to be evenly tanned? I wear very light clothes and I'm always outside.
-3-hand,oneShotId:75,count-role;self&timeinstage;1-:=thinking.png,I don't have tan marks, right? It's not easy for me, because of the clothes I usually wear. But I don't like to take off my swimsuit when I'm sunbathing, so...
-3-hand,oneShotId:75,count-role;self&timeinstage;1-:=thinking.png,Now that I took off my top, do I have tan marks? Thankfully, I work very hard to avoid that. But enough about my breasts, let's focus on the game.
-3-hand,oneShotId:72,count-role;self&timeinstage;0-:=annoyed.png,I hope none of you try to pick a fight with me now that I don't have my Clima-Tact. Even if I can't do much without it, I still can... run really fast.
-3-hand,oneShotId:72,count-role;self&timeinstage;0-:=smiling.png,Now, if a fight breaks out for whatever reason, I'll have to try to stay out of it. With my Clima-Tact I could just zap all of you until you calm down.
-3-hand,oneShotId:72,count-role;self&timeinstage;0-:=happy.png,Even without my Clima-Tact, I wouldn't recommend trying anything with me. I have very strong friends, and they won't stand idly by if you lay a finger on me.
-3-hand,oneShotId:247,count-role;self&timeinstage;0-:,id:53,marker:dreams=calm.png,I say we should know each other better. Do you guys have any dreams? My dream is to draw a map of the whole world. I've made a lot of progress, but I'm not even close!
-3-hand,oneShotId:247,count-role;self&timeinstage;0-:,id:53,marker:dreams=calm.png,Do you guys have a dream? Something you want to achieve at any cost? Ever since I was little, my dream has been to draw the first map of the entire world.
-3-hand,oneShotId:247,count-role;self&timeinstage;0-:,id:53,marker:dreams=calm.png,I'd like to know you guys better. Do you have a dream? All my crew mates have their sight set on a specific goal. For me, it's to draw a map of the world.
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;nayru&stage;5&timeinstage;0&saidmarker;poss_draw&sayingmarker;poss_hand:=serious.png,Is Nayru being controlled by someone? There must be a Devil Fruit user around doing this... This is serious.
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;futaba&stage;4&timeinstage;0:=happy.png,It really sounds like a fascinating team. If Luffy hadn't asked me to join his crew, maybe I would've ended up joining a team like that. Who knows?
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;revy&sayingmarker;killing:,id:63,marker:revy_killer=smiling.png,I've never killed anyone. I think I once kicked a Devil Fruit user into the sea... B-but I'm not a killer!
-3-hand,oneShotId:251,count-role;other&character;jessie&saidmarker;NamiDreams:,marker:jessie_dollars=happy.png,Jessie, you said earlier that you want a billion dollars. How much is that in beli? Either way, it seems we both have a fondness for money.
-3-hand,oneShotId:246,count-role;self&timeinstage;0-:,id:52,marker:luffy=thinking.png,Want to know about my crew? Let's see... Luffy is our captain. He's a big goofball and I'm always hitting him for doing stupid things, but there's nobody I'd rather give my life for. I know he'll become King of the Pirates.
-3-hand,oneShotId:246,count-role;self&timeinstage;0-:,id:52,marker:zoro=thinking.png,Want to know about my crew? Let's see... There's Zoro, he's a swordsman who uses three swords. He's freakishly strong, but if you leave him alone he's bound to get into trouble or get lost. Or both.
-3-hand,oneShotId:246,count-role;self&timeinstage;0-:,id:52,marker:usopp=thinking.png,Want to know about my crew? Let's see... Usopp is the sniper. He's probably the only one who's a bigger coward than me, but in dire situations he always comes through. I also owe him for my weapon, but don't tell him that.
-3-hand,oneShotId:246,count-role;self&timeinstage;0-:,id:52,marker:sanji=thinking.png,Want to know about my crew? Let's see... Sanji is our cook. He always annoys me because of how much of a pervert he is, but deep down he still has a good heart. And his food is amazing.
-3-hand,oneShotId:246,count-role;self&timeinstage;0-:,id:52,marker:chopper=thinking.png,Want to know about my crew? Let's see... Chopper is the doctor. He's actually a reindeer who can turn into a human thanks to a Devil Fruit. He's not only an amazing doctor, but is also super cute.
-3-hand,oneShotId:246,count-role;self&timeinstage;0-:,id:52,marker:robin=thinking.png,Want to know about my crew? Let's see... Robin is an archeologist. She's the only other girl in the crew. She might seem too serious because she's been through a lot, but at this point she's like a big sister to me.
-3-hand,oneShotId:246,count-role;self&timeinstage;0-:,id:52,marker:franky=thinking.png,Want to know about my crew? Let's see... Franky is the shipwright. He built our current ship, the Thousand Sunny. He has built some amazing stuff, but he also likes to create useless crap for some reason.
-3-hand,oneShotId:246,count-role;self&timeinstage;0-:,id:52,marker:brook=thinking.png,Want to know about my crew? Let's see... Brook is our musician. He's literally a living skeleton, so you'd freak out if you saw him, I know I did the first time. But he's actually harmless, even if he's always annoying me.
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;ryuko&stage;0-1&sayingmarker;mako:=thinking.png,Who is that girl? But more importantly, where is that light coming from?
-3-hand,oneShotId:253,count-role;other&character;jessie&saidmarker;NamiPresentation:=thinking.png,You don't know what navigators do, Jessie? It means I'm responsible for determining the best course for my ship. I guess I could work as a tour guide, too...
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;miko&stage;1&timeinstage;0&sayingmarker;Tojiko_Intro:=thinking.png,Your partner is a ghost? That should seem weirder to me, but I'm friends with a reindeer, a cyborg and an skeleton, so...
-3-hand,count-role;other&character;jessie&sayingmarker;jessieForfeitFeedback:,id:83=thinking.png,Your performance was... good, I guess. And weirdly educational.
-3-hand,oneShotId:252,count-role;self&saidmarker;pirate:,count-role;other&character;jessie&sayingmarker;NamiPirateProposal:,marker:jessie_proposal=smiling.png,As tempting as that sounds, Jessie, the risk is too high. I'm not just some small fry, so they wouldn't just let me escape if they capture me.
-3-hand,count-role;self&timeinstage;0:,count-role;other&character;futaba:=sad.png,Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to call you weird, Futaba. It's perfectly fine if you have a lot of hair <i>below</i>.

-3-hand,oneShotId:154,count-role;self&timeinstage;0-:,test:~background.location~:outdoors=sad.png,I wonder what the Marine's stance on public exposure is. I wouldn't want my bounty to increase because I'm naked outside. It's all because of the game, but I doubt they'd care.

0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:mulan=annoyed.png,What's that supposed to mean? I'm cute and refined... I could very well be a princess.
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:pit=seductive.png,My shirt? Oh, this is how I dress. You don't like it, Pit? ♡
0-must_strip,alsoPlaying:saki_zls=smiling.png,Heheh, I actually like that, Saki. I love tangerines. Not because of my hair, it's more of a family thing.
0-must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2,oneShotId:120=furious.png,Two times in a row? What the hell?
0-must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2,oneShotId:120=furious.png,Again? I didn't even enjoy it the first time!
0-must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2,oneShotId:120=furious.png,It hasn't even been a minute since I stripped last! Give me a break.
0-must_strip,consecutiveLosses:3,oneShotId:121=sad.png,Have I really lost three times in a row? Why'd things have to come to this all of a sudden?
0-must_strip,consecutiveLosses:3,oneShotId:121=sad.png,Three times in a row? What am I doing wrong?
0-must_strip,consecutiveLosses:4-,oneShotId:122=shocked.png,What is happening? Why am I losing so much? I lost count already...
0-must_strip,consecutiveLosses:4-,oneShotId:122=shocked.png,Why do I keep losing again and again? Is this some kind of conspiracy?
0-must_strip,count-role;other&character;caulifla&stage;0-4:=smiling.png,Heheh, I don't know about that. I probably seem wilder than I am. Usually I just avoid danger, or run away from it.
0-must_strip,count-role;other&character;akko:=furious.png,Sea witch?! That's so rude! Someone should teach you some manners.
0-must_strip,count-role;self&notsaidmarker;manipulation1:,count-role;other&character;jessie:=seductive.png,Hmm? This is what I feel comfortable wearing. If it's a sexy attire, I can't help it.

0-must_strip,hasHand:One Pair,oneShotId:156=smug.png,Whoa, you're really trying to make me lose the game. I doubt it'll work.
0-must_strip,hasHand:One Pair,oneShotId:156=calm.png,Impressive. Well, kind of. It wasn't a great hand you beat, anyway.
0-must_strip,hasHand:One Pair,oneShotId:156=calm.png,Huh, this is more competition than I was expecting. Still, it doesn't matter.
0-must_strip,hasHand:Three of a Kind,oneShotId:159=shocked.png,What?! Seriously? Ugh, if you beat this hand that must mean you're <i>really</i> good at this game.
0-must_strip,hasHand:Two Pair,oneShotId:158=shocked.png,I lost? But I had a pair... I mean two! I had Two pair?
0-must_strip,saidMarker:manipulation1,oneShotId:27,priority:99,marker:manipulation1end=sad.png,Gah, I have no idea why I thought that would work.
0-must_strip,saidMarker:manipulation1,oneShotId:27,priority:99,marker:manipulation1end=annoyed.png,Well, it was worth a shot. I guess.
0-must_strip,saidMarker:manipulation1,oneShotId:27,priority:99,marker:manipulation1end=serious.png,I suppose I'm not as good at lying as Usopp.

0-must_strip,totalRounds:0=shocked.png,Oh... This better not be an indication of how this game is gonna go for me.
0-must_strip,totalRounds:0=serious.png,Losing the first round... Maybe this will teach me to be more careful from now on.
0-must_strip,totalRounds:0,notSaidMarker:presentation,marker:presentation=shocked.png,I already lost a round? I haven't even said my name! It's Nami, by the way.
0-must_strip,totalRounds:0,notSaidMarker:presentation,marker:presentation=shocked.png,Hello, I'm Nami, and... I already lost a round. What kind of a game is this?
0-must_strip_winning=smug.png,I lost? Doesn't matter, there's already a clear favorite in this game.
0-must_strip_winning=smug.png,Me? Were you jealous that I was the only one with all her clothes on?
0-must_strip_winning=smiling.png,I lost? Okay!
0-must_strip_normal=sad.png,I wanted to win without losing once. Meh, it's no big deal.
0-must_strip_normal=calm.png,Whatever. It's not like it hurts my pride to lose once in this game.
0-must_strip_normal=thinking.png,I guess I can afford losing once or twice with no problem.
0-must_strip_losing=annoyed.png,Why do you all wear so many clothes? Even with everything I wear, I'm already losing.
0-must_strip_losing=annoyed.png,I'm already losing. And it's not because I'm dressed lightly, it's you who are way overdressed.
0-must_strip_losing=annoyed.png,I started this game with a clear disadvantage, didn't I?
0-stripping,id:10=custom:stripping,I'll take off my belt first. Oh, that means I also have to remove my Clima-Tact. Pretty cool how it extends, huh? I have Usopp to thank for that.
0-stripping,id:10=custom:stripping,My belt and my Clima-Tact come off first. Do you like it? It's a marvel of science, it allows me to control the weather... kinda.
0-stripping,id:10=custom:stripping,I'll remove my belt, which means I also have to leave my Clima-Tact. It's this thing that looks like a baton, but it's actually a weapon that allows me to do a lot of weather related tricks.
0-stripping,id:10=custom:stripping,I'll start with my belt and my Clima-Tact. This is a weapon I made with the knowledge I gained in Weatheria. I guess I have Usopp to thank for the design too.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:juri,id:37=custom:stripping,This is my Clima-Tact, and... What did you say? Dildo?! How can you have such a filthy mind?
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=custom:stripping,Y-you're kidding, right? I had a hard enough time believing there was an island in the sky, and now you're telling me there are people on other planets?!
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:miko=custom:stripping,W-what? Why... why do you think I'd want to steal your stuff? Are you a mind reader, by any chance?
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:mulan,id:40=custom:stripping,I'm not strong like my crew mates, but I needed a way to fight alongside them. That's why I asked Usopp to make a weapon for me. It's all I have in a fight.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:saki_zls=custom:stripping,It's not a sex toy! It's my Clima-Tact, and it's a weapon. Why does everyone think it has other purposes?
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,id:49=custom:stripping,You have an interesting mind, Zone-tan. And by that I mean filthy.
0-stripping,count-role;other&character;akko:=custom:stripping,<i>Clima-Tact</i>, Akko. I don't blame you for thinking it's magic, though. It does some pretty impressive stuff, heheh.
0-stripping,count-role;other&character;jessie:,id:80=custom:stripping,This is a weapon, Jessie! You must have a very filthy mind to come to that conclusion.

1-stripped=stripped.png,I felt a little silly wearing this when I'm not going to fight anyone here. I hope.
1-stripped=stripped.png,I'm not a strong fighter like Luffy or Zoro. But with my Clima-Tact I can hold my own in a fight. Take good care of it.
1-stripped=stripped.png,Please take care of my Clima-Tact. Without it I would just be a burden to my crew in a fight.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:akko=stripped.png,Oh, you mean that stuff you're carrying is a weapon like my Clima-Tact? I'd love to examine it!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:cammy_white=stripped.png,Why are you so suspicious of me, Cammy? A girl needs a way to defend herself out on the sea.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:chun-li,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=stripped.png,Maybe I'll show you my Clima-Tact in action, Chun-Li. But you're gonna have to beat me first.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:chun-li,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=stripped.png,If you want me to show you what my Clima-Tact can do, you're gonna have to defeat me, Chun-Li.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:futaba=stripped.png,Maybe I was exaggerating. I can't control the weather with my Clima-Tact. I can only make it rain, summon lighting, create mirages... You know, nothing too crazy.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:juri=stripped.png,You know, maybe I can help you clean your mind later, Juri. It will require a lot of electricity.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:miko=stripped.png,Yeah, we all have valuable items that we would miss dearly if they got lost. That's why it's a good thing that there isn't a thief among us, heheh...
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:mulan=stripped.png,Oh yeah, I do rely on my brains a lot too. And I wouldn't say I run the show, but I do choose the course of our ship, handle the money, and pretty much keep everyone alive.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=stripped.png,Heh, don't worry, Pit. You seem like a good guy, and lucky for you I'm fond of sky people.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:saki_zls=stripped.png,"Franchachá"? That's a strange name for a crew...
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:syrenne=stripped.png,I get you, Syrenne. Unfortunately, I'm not very strong physically, so I have to rely on weapons and wits to put up a fight.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=stripped.png,You'll have to find your own, hands off my belt and rod. Ugh, why does that sound so dirty now?
1-stripped,count-role;other&character;jessie:=stripped.png,I'm sorry to say it, but I'm pretty sure you're the only one that thinks like that.
1-must_strip,alsoPlaying:akko=thinking.png,Magic to turn into a fish? You mean a Devil Fruit? Wait, that doesn't work since you wouldn't be able to swim. What are you talking about, Akko?

1-must_strip_losing=annoyed.png,Damn. You're not making this easy for me, are you?
1-stripping=stripping.png,I'll remove my Log Pose. Hmm, I guess I should also remove the bracelet my sister gave me. Hmmm, I wonder how Nojiko is doing? I miss her.
1-stripping=stripping.png,I'll take off my sister's bracelet. And this contraption that looks like a watch is my Log Pose. It's kinda like a compass, but for sailing through the Grand Line.
1-stripping=stripping.png,I'll take off my sister's bracelet. And so you don't complain, I'll also remove my Log Pose. They're both incredibly important to me, so you should appreciate this.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:akko=stripping.png,Huh? It's a Log Pose, I use it to decide the course of our ship through the Grand Line. It has nothing to do with "magic".
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:futaba=stripping.png,My Log Pose? It's simple, Futaba. See this three needles? Each one points to a different island in the Grand Line. The more the needle moves, the more dangerous it is.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:syrenne=stripping.png,Oh, thank you, Syrenne. I don't get that very often, even though my tattoo is always visible because of the clothes I wear.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingSaying:bazonkadongs=stripping.png,Bazonka... what? Are you talking about my breasts? But I'm not showing them that much.
1-stripping,count-role;other&character;jessie:=stripping.png,Not a watch, it a Log Pose. And it was present, which means it costed nothing, heheh...

2-must_strip,saidMarker:manipulation3,notSaidMarker:manipulation3end,oneShotId:45,priority:99,marker:manipulation3end=serious.png,Really, ~player~? How are you going to sleep tonight knowing you doomed that school to poverty. I mean, the orphanage. I mean... whatever.
2-must_strip,saidMarker:seduction3,notSaidMarker:seduction3end,oneShotId:31,priority:99,marker:seduction3end=serious.png,Okay. I guess you didn't want that kiss after all, ~player~.

3-must_strip,saidMarker:manipulation4,notSaidMarker:manipulation4end,oneShotId:49,priority:99,marker:manipulation4end=serious.png,Oh, so you really have a death wish, ~player~. It's your funeral...
3-must_strip,saidMarker:manipulation4,notSaidMarker:manipulation4end,oneShotId:49,priority:99,marker:manipulation4end=serious.png,Really? Well, maybe the Straw Hat Pirates will pay you a visit in the near future, ~player~. Maybe...
3-must_strip,saidMarker:manipulation4,notSaidMarker:manipulation4end,oneShotId:49,priority:99,marker:manipulation4end=serious.png,Are you not scared of anything, ~player~? Even I was trembling while saying that.
3-must_strip,saidMarker:seduction4,notSaidMarker:seduction4end,oneShotId:33,priority:99,marker:seduction4end=annoyed.png,I guess we'll never know what would've happened if you lost, ~player~. I hope you can live with that.
3-must_strip,saidMarker:seduction4,notSaidMarker:seduction4end,oneShotId:33,priority:99,marker:seduction4end=sad.png,I have a feeling you don't like me, ~player~.
3-must_strip,saidMarker:seduction4,notSaidMarker:seduction4end,oneShotId:33,priority:99,marker:seduction4end=sad.png,Really? You're not even willing to lose one little round for me, ~player~?
3-must_strip,timeInStage:8-,oneShotId:91=serious.png,Bah, I didn't want to lose again. I was fine with these clothes.
3-must_strip_winning=thinking.png,I'm still ahead, but now I'll have to take off my jeans. I don't have any other option, do I?
3-must_strip_winning=serious.png,Since I'm winning, I'm not worried. But if I lose another time, it'll be the worst.
3-must_strip_winning=serious.png,Hmm, okay. At least I still have my jeans...
3-must_strip_normal=annoyed.png,Fine, I'll strip. But remember you'll owe me!
3-must_strip_normal=embarrassed.png,Whatever. I'm not embarrassed to be seen in a bikini. I do it all the time.
3-must_strip_normal=annoyed.png,Oh, sure. Let's all gang up on the poor, little, innocent, pirate girl. Very mature.
3-must_strip_losing=shocked.png,Why am I doing so badly? I thought I was good at poker.
3-must_strip_losing=furious.png,Did you all conspire against me to make me lose first? Hmph...
3-must_strip_losing=furious.png,There's only one explanation for me losing so badly: You're all cheaters!
3-stripping=stripping.png,Nggh, I didn't want to lose my pants. But there's nothing I can do if I want to win.
3-stripping=stripping.png,I only enjoy trying different clothes. Not taking them off... in front of a bunch of people.
3-stripping=stripping.png,There's no turning back now. I'll take off my pants.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:akko=stripping.png,You're not wrong, Akko. And they're kind of low-cut, so...
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:cammy_white=stripping.png,I know pirates like those very well, trust me. But my crew is different, I promise.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:chun-li=stripping.png,A bounty placed on me by the World Government... I have friends who have dreams. And so do I.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:nami_satellites=stripping.png,I don't buy it... If such devices exist, who's in control of them? How come they haven't been used to pinpoint the location of Raftel and One Piece? I'm starting to think you're from a different world or something, Meia.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=stripping.png,Really, Pit? Even you? This is why I didn't want to tell anyone I'm a pirate.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:sayaka=stripping.png,Calm down. This isn't a strip search.
3-stripping,count-role;other&character;jessie:=stripping.png,Oh, you know... This and that. Mosty pissing off the World Government and the Marines.


#losing top
4-stripped=stripped.png,Good thing I'm wearing my bikini underneath and not my panties. I'm very comfortable wearing a bikini.
4-stripped=stripped.png,Oh, right. I'm wearing my bikini underneath. Enjoy this, because it's the most naked you'll see me.
4-stripped=stripped.png,I'm not wearing panties under my jeans, but my bikini. I'm sure Brook would be disappointed if he was here.
4-stripped=stripped.png,I'm wearing my matching bikini bottom under my jeans. You can't say I don't have a good sense of style, huh?
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:cammy_white=stripped.png,You won't regret it, Cammy. I admire your sense of justice.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:chun-li=stripped.png,Thank you, Chun-Li. You're one of the good ones. I'll prove to you I am too.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:nami_satellites=sad.png,Hey, if anyone is sending fleets to kill your people, it has to be the World Government. I wouldn't put it past them, though I doubt they have the resources to send armies into outer space. I hope...
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:misty_hgss=stripped.png,Heheh, maybe we can go for a swim together sometime. Misty. I'm sure you're better than me, but perhaps you can teach me a few things.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:sayaka=serious.png,Cop dramas? What's a cop? Is it some kind of Marine unit?
4-must_strip,alsoPlaying:emi,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:800m,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:800m2=furious.png,Hey, I never agreed to race you! And isn't having to strip punishment enough already?
4-must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2,oneShotId:120=furious.png,Two times in a row? What the hell?
4-must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2,oneShotId:120=furious.png,Again? I didn't even enjoy it the first time!
4-must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2,oneShotId:120=furious.png,It hasn't even been a minute since I stripped last! Give me a break.
4-must_strip,consecutiveLosses:3,oneShotId:121=sad.png,Have I really lost three times in a row? Why'd things have to come to this all of a sudden?
4-must_strip,consecutiveLosses:3,oneShotId:121=sad.png,Three times in a row? What am I doing wrong?
4-must_strip,consecutiveLosses:4-,oneShotId:122=shocked.png,What is happening? Why am I losing so much? I lost count already...
4-must_strip,consecutiveLosses:4-,oneShotId:122=shocked.png,Why do I keep losing again and again? Is this some kind of conspiracy?
4-must_strip,hasHand:One Pair,oneShotId:155=shocked.png,Oh, crap! This pair was the only thing protecting my dignity.
4-must_strip,hasHand:One Pair,oneShotId:155=sad.png,Stupid cards, why did I trust you?
4-must_strip,hasHand:One Pair,oneShotId:155=furious.png,This stupid hand betrayed me! Just because you had better cards?
4-must_strip,hasHand:Three of a Kind,oneShotId:159=shocked.png,What?! Seriously? Ugh, if you beat this hand that must mean you're <i>really</i> good at this game.
4-must_strip,hasHand:Two Pair,oneShotId:158=shocked.png,I lost? But I had a pair... I mean two! I had Two pair?
4-must_strip,saidMarker:manipulation5,notSaidMarker:manipulation5end,oneShotId:53,priority:99,marker:manipulation5=furious.png,You rejected my offer? Despite how generous it was? Grrrr...
4-must_strip,saidMarker:manipulation5,notSaidMarker:manipulation5end,oneShotId:53,priority:99,marker:manipulation5=furious.png,Seriously? Fine! I'll just win the prize, and keep it all for myself!
4-must_strip,saidMarker:manipulation5,notSaidMarker:manipulation5end,oneShotId:53,priority:99,marker:manipulation5=furious.png,Do you realize how hard it was for me to make that offer? Your loss, buddy!
4-must_strip,saidMarker:seduction5,notSaidMarker:seduction5end,oneShotId:8,priority:99,marker:seduction5end=sad.png,So you just want to leave <i>me</i> naked. Huh, ~player~?
4-must_strip,saidMarker:seduction5,notSaidMarker:seduction5end,oneShotId:8,priority:99,marker:seduction5end=serious.png,(Even that didn't work? Damn it, ~player~...)
4-must_strip,saidMarker:seduction5,notSaidMarker:seduction5end,oneShotId:8,priority:99,marker:seduction5end=sad.png,(How did that not work? Is ~player~ made of stone?)
4-must_strip,timeInStage:8-,oneShotId:92=sad.png,Ugh, why...? For once I thought I wouldn't lose another time.
4-must_strip_winning=sad.png,What good is it to be winning if I still have to expose myself?
4-must_strip_winning=sad.png,It doesn't feel like I'm winning the game...
4-must_strip_winning=sad.png,Am I still winning the game? I'm not sure.
4-must_strip_normal=sad.png,<i>Sigh</i>... Crying isn't gonna help. I guess I'll just do it.
4-must_strip_normal=shocked.png,Argh, this is what I wanted to avoid the most...
4-must_strip_normal=sad.png,Oh, for goodness' sake... Why does this game hate me?
4-must_strip_losing=shocked.png,I really have to expose myself? I'm getting my ass kicked!
4-must_strip_losing=shocked.png,Why is this going so poorly for me? What did I do?
4-must_strip_losing=furious.png,What is happening?! Why do I have to undress again?
4-stripping=stripping.png,If I'm doing this is only because I can still win.
4-stripping=stripping.png,Even if I wear a lot of bikinis, I'm not used to going topless.
4-stripping=stripping.png,I'm not embarrassed. I just... don't want to do this.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:sayaka=stripping.png,I'm not a real criminal, Sayaka. Well, to the World Government I am... But I'm not dangerous, I swear!
4-stripping,count-role;other&character;jessie:=stripping.png,I know, you don't have to remind me.


#losing bikini bottom
5-stripped=stripped.png,I swear, I should make you all pay me for seeing me like this.
5-stripped=stripped.png,Seriously, my breasts were way smaller not too long ago.
5-stripped=stripped.png,Seeing me like this will cost you... 200.000 beli each. Yeah, that sounds right. Now I feel better, heheh.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:akko=stripped.png,If I have to get topless anyway, hiding my body in embarrassment would only make me feel worse.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=stripped.png,Oh, thank you, Pit. Are you really looking at my tattoo, though...?
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:sayaka=serious.png,There's no reasoning with you, is there?
5-stripped,count-role;other&character;jessie:=stripped.png,Seriously? Shouldn't it be the other way around?
5-must_strip,alsoPlaying:emi,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:800m,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:800m2=furious.png,Hey, I never agreed to race you! And isn't having to strip punishment enough already?
5-must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2,oneShotId:120=furious.png,Two times in a row? What the hell?
5-must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2,oneShotId:120=furious.png,Again? I didn't even enjoy it the first time!
5-must_strip,consecutiveLosses:2,oneShotId:120=furious.png,It hasn't even been a minute since I stripped last! Give me a break.
5-must_strip,consecutiveLosses:3,oneShotId:121=sad.png,Have I really lost three times in a row? Why'd things have to come to this all of a sudden?
5-must_strip,consecutiveLosses:3,oneShotId:121=sad.png,Three times in a row? What am I doing wrong?
5-must_strip,consecutiveLosses:4-,oneShotId:122=shocked.png,What is happening? Why am I losing so much? I lost count already...
5-must_strip,consecutiveLosses:4-,oneShotId:122=shocked.png,Why do I keep losing again and again? Is this some kind of conspiracy?
5-must_strip,hasHand:One Pair,oneShotId:155=shocked.png,Oh, crap! This pair was the only thing protecting my dignity.
5-must_strip,hasHand:One Pair,oneShotId:155=sad.png,Stupid cards, why did I trust you?

5-must_strip,hasHand:Two Pair,oneShotId:158=shocked.png,I lost? But I had a pair... I mean two! I had Two pair?
5-must_strip,saidMarker:manipulation6,notSaidMarker:manipulation6end,priority:99,marker:manipulation6end=serious.png,Wow. Yeah, I was lying, but what I'd been telling the truth?
5-must_strip,saidMarker:manipulation6,notSaidMarker:manipulation6end,priority:99,marker:manipulation6end=serious.png,Really? Okay, that was a lie. But that's still no way to treat a lady in crisis.
5-must_strip,saidMarker:manipulation6,notSaidMarker:manipulation6end,priority:99,marker:manipulation6end=serious.png,I hope you knew I was lying, because if not that's a very scummy thing to do to a woman.
5-must_strip,saidMarker:seduction6,notSaidMarker:seduction6end,oneShotId:37,priority:99,marker:seduction6end=sad.png,I know I shouldn't, but after what I just said I'm little relieved I lost. Even if I now have to show everything.
5-must_strip,saidMarker:seduction6,notSaidMarker:seduction6end,oneShotId:37,priority:99,marker:seduction6end=sad.png,So I have to strip for the last time... (At least I won't have to let anyone touch my breasts.)
5-must_strip,saidMarker:seduction6,notSaidMarker:seduction6end,oneShotId:37,priority:99,marker:seduction6end=serious.png,OK, I lost. By the way, ~player~? I wasn't serious about letting you touch my breasts.
5-must_strip,timeInStage:8-,oneShotId:93=furious.png,No! Are you kidding me?! What good was it to win so many rounds if I still lost?!
5-must_strip_winning=sad.png,Gah... What does it matter that I'm winning if I still have to show <i>everything</i> now?
5-must_strip_winning=furious.png,Am I still winning? Then why the hell do I have to get naked?!
5-must_strip_winning=embarrassed.png,I can't be winning if I have to get fully naked...
5-must_strip_normal=shocked.png,You're kidding... I lost?
5-must_strip_normal=shocked.png,Ghh... No...
5-must_strip_normal=shocked.png,W-wha... I don't wanna...
5-must_strip_losing=sad.png,I'm losing everything, including my dignity. Playing this game was a bad idea.
5-must_strip_losing=annoyed.png,What the hell was I thinking when I came here? Oh, right. The money...
5-must_strip_losing=furious.png,Damn you all! Why are you so good at this?
5-stripping=stripping.png,<i>Sigh</i>... Why me? At least there's nobody here who knows me.
5-stripping=stripping.png,I won't forgive you all for putting me in this position.
5-stripping=stripping.png,If I'm doing this because I want to win the prize, does it mean I'm stripping for money? I guess I won't think about it.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:futaba=stripping.png,We have to take care of our skin, Futaba. But that couldn't be farther away from my mind right now.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=stripping.png,Of course I'm embarrassed! I'm a pirate, but I'm not made of stone.

-3-stripped=stripped.png,Y-yeah, I shaved yesterday. My friend Robin taught me how to do it like this.
-3-stripped=stripped.png,I have to shave like this, or I wouldn't be able to wear a bikini.
-3-stripped=stripped.png,What? This is a normal bikini shave.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:futaba=stripped.png,Why are you getting all weird, Futaba? You don't think this is uncomfortable enough for me already?
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=stripped.png,Thank you for the compliment, Zone-tan. It only makes me a little uncomfortable...
-3-stripped,saidMarker:target1=stripped.png,~Player~? Your nose is bleeding...
-3-stripped,saidMarker:target1=stripped.png,Is your nose bleeding, ~player~? I'd lend you my handkerchief, but... you know.
-3-stripped,saidMarker:target1=stripped.png,Your nose is bleeding, ~player~. That's not my fault, I didn't want to get to this point.




#OPPONENT MUST STRIP
#These lines are spoken when an opponent must strip, but the character does not yet know what they will take off.
#Writing different variations is important here, as these lines will be spoken about thirty times per game.
#The "human" versions of the lines will only be spoken if the human player is stripping.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written
tie=thinking.png,Seriously? A tie? I didn't know that was a thing in this game. Well, no harm done.
tie=thinking.png,A tie, huh? Does that mean there are two losers in this round? Oh, no one loses! That makes more sense.

0-male_must_strip=embarrassed.png,You shouldn't underestimate me just because I'm a cute girl. I know what I'm doing.
0-male_must_strip=smug.png,Tough luck, ~name~. Then again, maybe you're just bad at this.
0-male_must_strip=win.png,I didn't lose! Nice.
0-male_must_strip=win.png,That's what I'm talking about!

0-male_must_strip,count-role;target&character;dust&stage;0:=happy.png,Oh, I didn't notice before you have a tail. You must be a Mink.
0-male_must_strip,count-role;target&character;n&stage;0:=sad.png,What kind of a name is <i>N</i>? It's gotta be fake. Oh, maybe I should've given a fake name too.
0-male_must_strip,target:human,filter:gay,notSaidMarker:target2,marker:target2=thinking.png,(Hmmm, ~player~ doesn't seem to be interested in me. Never mind, there are other ways to manipulate people besides seducing them.)
0-male_must_strip,target:human,filter:gay,notSaidMarker:target2,marker:target2=thinking.png,(I don't think ~player~ is attracted to women. But I'm sure I can convince him to lose using other tactics.)
0-male_must_strip,target:human,filter:gay,notSaidMarker:target2,marker:target2=thinking.png,(Is ~player~ not into women? He hasn't looked at me. Still, I'm confident I can convince him to lose the game through other means.)

0-male_must_strip,target:kamina,targetStage:0=serious.png,Who's this guy? He's like a Franky without the robot parts. I feel like he's gonna scream <i>Suuuper</i> at any moment.
0-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You're an Skypiean, right? Heso! Did you come down to the surface just to play this game?
0-male_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:target1,test:~human.tag.gay~:false,marker:target1=thinking.png,(I bet I can seduce this guy and get him to throw the game. He has that same silly expression Sanji has when he looks at me.)
0-male_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:target1,test:~human.tag.gay~:false,marker:target1=thinking.png,(~Player~ looks like the kind of man that is easy to manipulate for my own benefit. Just like Sanji.)

0-female_must_strip=happy.png,Very well. I'm on the right track here.

0-female_must_strip=win.png,I'm doing great! Aren't I?
0-female_must_strip=thinking.png,You can ask another player to help you undress? I didn't know that.
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lotte&stage;0:=smiling.png,Are you pretending you're a witch? Aren't you a little too old to play games? Though I guess you're not hurting anyone.
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;jessie&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I don't think I've ever met someone who works in <i>that kind of stuff</i>. But you seem very easy to talk to, Jessie.
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;haru&stage;0-2:=smiling.png,I wonder if that hair is softer than Chopper's fur. Would it be weird if I touch it?
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;2:=thinking.png,I've seen a lot of weird stuff sailing with my crew, but everything can still be explained. That's why I don't believe in magic. Are you sure you didn't eat a Devil Fruit without noticing? It happens.
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;0:=sad.png,Scary looking woman... (She reminds me a little of Robin when I first met her.)

0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;erufuda:=smiling.png,From what I see, you like fries <i>a lot</i>.

0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;mythra&stage;0:=thinking.png,That's a very elaborate... dress? Armor? Hmm, it's a little revealing to be armor.
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;jolyne&stage;0:=smiling.png,That's a very unique look you have, Jolyne. If you were a wanted criminal, you'd be very easy to find, hahah...
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;0:=smiling.png,That's an adorable witch outfit. This isn't a costume party, though.
0-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;0:=smiling.png,This is just a wild guess, but you like the color pink, don't you?

0-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:fighter,oneShotId:118=annoyed.png,So you're a fighter. It's a good thing my crew mates are not here, or some of them would be eager to get into a fight with her for no reason.

0-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:ginger,oneShotId:236,priority:200=smiling.png,I really like your hair, ~name~. I don't know why.
0-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:non-human,oneShotId:117,priority:240=thinking.png,What a weird creature... Good thing Luffy isn't here, or he would ask her to join the crew.
0-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:non-human,oneShotId:117,priority:240=thinking.png,What is <i>that</i>? The sea really is a vast place...
0-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:princess,oneShotId:116=smiling.png,You're a princess? You wouldn't happen to know Vivi, right? She's the princess of the Kingdom of Alabasta. I haven't talked to her in a while.
0-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:princess,oneShotId:116=smiling.png,You're a princess, right? I've met a few, I know what they look like.
0-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:princess,oneShotId:116=greedy.png,Oh, a princess! I bet your kingdom is rich and powerful. Those clothes you're wearing look expensive...
0-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:scantily-clad,oneShotId:115,priority:220=happy.png,And people say that I dress inappropriately. That's still a cute outfit, though...
0-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:scantily-clad,oneShotId:115,priority:220=happy.png,I don't see anything indecent about that outfit, but I also don't consider my own look inappropriate and people are always bugging me about me. What do you think, ~player~?
0-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:school_uniform,oneShotId:114=serious.png,You... look a little young to be here. If you're as young as you look, you should leave now.
0-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:school_uniform,oneShotId:114=serious.png,Doesn't that uniform mean you're still in school? Then what do you think you're doing here?
0-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:0=serious.png,What kind of attire is that? (She barely looks human.)
0-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5=serious.png,What are you waiting for? You don't have any more clothes, do you?
0-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You look like you come from a different civilization... or you have a very interesting sense of fashion. Either way, I like your outfit.
0-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=annoyed.png,You were already naked before you grew those flowers. I don't like cheaters; but if you're going to do it, at least try to be subtle.
0-female_must_strip,target:cammy_white,targetStage:0=thinking.png,That's a nice leotard you're wearing... if a little tight, maybe.
0-female_must_strip,target:cammy_white,targetStage:3=smug.png,You're taking off your leotard now? Now we'll see just how tight it really is.

0-female_must_strip,target:caulifla,targetStage:0=thinking.png,That's some crazy hair you have. Did you eat a Devil Fruit that lets you transform into a hedgehog or something?
0-female_must_strip,target:caulifla,targetStage:1=serious.png,What are you doing? (Doesn't she know she has to strip now?)
0-female_must_strip,target:caulifla,targetStage:2=smug.png,You think you're so strong because you can turn your hair yellow? I'm sure my crew mates are stronger than you.
0-female_must_strip,target:caulifla,targetStage:4=smiling.png,Going back to black? Did you get tired of being blonde?
0-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You are a fighter, huh? Do you fight using kicks? (Those legs...)
0-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=calm.png,Are you a princess, Elizabeth? You're so well mannered and properly dressed that I'd find it hard to believe you're not from a wealthy family.
0-female_must_strip,target:emi,targetStage:0-1,targetSaidMarker:800m,targetSayingMarker:800m2=smug.png,You're very confident about your running skills, huh? But this is poker, so...
0-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0=sad.png,You look way too shy to play a game like this? Nobody is forcing you to play, right? Because if that's the case...
0-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=smiling.png,So you're a navigator too, huh? And we have similar hair? Maybe you're my lost little sister or something, hahah...
0-female_must_strip,target:hanako,targetStage:0=calm.png,Playing this game to overcome your shyness is a bold move. I suppose that means you're already making progress.

0-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=calm.png,A pirate woman, huh? That's refreshing considering I'm usually dealing with men.
0-female_must_strip,target:juri,targetStage:0=serious.png,(This woman is intense. Crazy even. I should avoid talking to her.)
0-female_must_strip,target:kizuna,targetStage:0=thinking.png,So what does A.I. mean? Additional Interest? Annoying... Individual?
0-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=thinking.png,I feel like I've seen wings like those on someone. And the pink color...

0-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=thinking.png,That's an odd outfit. You look like a giant... strawberry.
0-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Did you say you're Dracula's daughter? You mean Dracule Mihawk, the Shichibukai?
0-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:1=smiling.png,Mavis, your look reminds me of Thriller Bark, for some reason. But it doesn't make sense, because you look like a nice girl and not like any of the monsters I saw there.
0-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=smiling.png,With that outfit, you clearly came from a winter island. Mei, right?
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=thinking.png,So you're a pirate? This is just a guess, but are you the captain by any chance?
0-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0=smiling.png,At last a normal, pleasant woman in this place. Nice to meet you, Misato.

0-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=thinking.png,I know pretty much anyone is allowed to play this game, but a ball of light? Really?
0-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:1=thinking.png,Are you part of that Tontatta Tribe from Dressrosa my crew told me about? You look like a fairy, at least.
0-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You have a very graceful look to you, Nayru. Kinda like what I imagine a goddess would look like.
0-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:3=thinking.png,Nayru, can I ask you about your ears? Are they part of your native race? I don't think I've ever met anyone with ears like that.

0-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=smiling.png,A goddess, huh? I've met a god before, but you seem a lot more pleasant.
0-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:1=thinking.png,So what are your powers as a goddess? Just out of curiosity, you can't summon lighting, can you?
0-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=thinking.png,A female wrestler, huh? I can understand guys being into stuff like that, the guys in my crew sure are. But a woman?
0-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:2,targetSayingMarker:cammy_help,alsoPlaying:cammy_white,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=calm.png,Are you sure you wanna help her, Cammy? Mika seems nice and all, but...

0-female_must_strip,target:rarity_eg,targetStage:0=seductive.png,You're a fashion designer, huh? What do you think of my outfit? I know I look good, but a second opinion doesn't hurt.
0-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=smiling.png,Aren't you trying a little too hard to be scary with that outfit? I mean, it's not like there are real witches or...

0-female_must_strip,target:ribbon_girl,targetStage:2=thinking.png,So, your arms... Did you get them after eating a Devil Fruit?
0-female_must_strip,target:rin,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:artistunlucky=sad.png,I could understand living with one arm, but without both of them? I'd be completely useless.
0-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Why does that thing in your uniform that looks like an eye keep moving? It's freaking me out more than the sword.
0-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:mako,totalRounds:0=furious.png,Gah! You scared me! I thought there were no more players allowed.
0-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=serious.png,Finally that creepy uniform is coming off. I swear that eye keeps looking at me.
0-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=smiling.png,That sword really looks like half of a pair of scissors. Oh, it's called Scissor Blade? That makes sense, heheh...
0-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=thinking.png,Smoke? How is that uniform even built? I'm sure Franky would like to take a closer look at it.
0-female_must_strip,target:saki_zls,targetStage:6=serious.png,Okay, I'll accept you even if you're a zombie as long as you don't try to eat me.
0-female_must_strip,target:sakura,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You're an idol, right? Are you looking for a manager? I'm sure I'd do a great job!
0-female_must_strip,target:sakura,targetStage:3=smiling.png,Sorry for freaking out earlier, Sakura. Even if you're a zombie, you seem pretty cool.
0-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=thinking.png,White and blue... Is that some kind of weird, experimental Marine uniform?
0-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=thinking.png,This witch you keep talking about is just a game or something, right? If there was really a witch here, I'd be the first one to run away.
0-female_must_strip,target:sayori,targetStage:0=calm.png,I like your energy, but... you know you're playing strip poker, right?
0-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=calm.png,I really feel under dressed next to you. What do you need all the armor and equipment for, anyway?
0-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=calm.png,An assassin, huh? Robin was an assassin too before she joined the crew, and she seemed a lot scarier than you. So I have no problem with that.
0-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:4=smug.png,So you're down to your underwear... Huh?
0-female_must_strip,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Did you say earlier you're a ship? I think you're confused, young lady. I know ships, and even if they're very different, I've never seen one that looks like a person.
0-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=shocked.png,A GHOST!!! Why didn't I see it earlier?!
0-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:1=sad.png,If someone had told me that today I'd be playing strip poker with a ghost when I woke up, I'd have laughed.
0-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:2=serious.png,Why does a ghost wear clothes, anyway? Don't you just usually put a sheet on top of you?
0-female_must_strip,target:syrenne,targetStage:0=shocked.png,(Just my luck that I'm in the same table as a bounty hunter. At least it's a woman. Worst case scenario, maybe I can reason with her.)
0-female_must_strip,target:syrenne,targetStage:1=thinking.png,Shouldn't you focus on the game instead of drinking? What are you drinking, anyway?
0-female_must_strip,target:syrenne,targetStage:5=serious.png,I told you. You're lucky you didn't spill your drink when you were fully clothed.
0-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=smiling.png,Even for a princess, you're a lot more... colorful than what I'm used to.
0-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Are you a member of Germa 66? I don't think I've every seen anyone else wear an outfit like that.
0-female_must_strip,target:weiss_schnee,targetStage:0=happy.png,Mmmm, I definitely know how to recognize the richest person in this place. And here she is...
0-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Is that a skull on your sweater? Are you a pirate?

1-male_must_strip,count-role;target&character;n&stage;0:=sad.png,What kind of a name is <i>N</i>? It's gotta be fake. Oh, maybe I should've given a fake name too.
1-male_must_strip,target:human,filter:gay,notSaidMarker:target2,marker:target2=thinking.png,(Hmmm, ~player~ doesn't seem to be interested in me. Never mind, there are other ways to manipulate people besides seducing them.)

1-male_must_strip,target:kamina,targetStage:0=serious.png,Who's this guy? He's like a Franky without the robot parts. I feel like he's gonna scream <i>Suuuper</i> at any moment.
1-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You're an Skypiean, right? Heso! Did you come down to the surface just to play this game?
1-male_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:target1,test:~human.tag.gay~:false,marker:target1=thinking.png,(I bet I can seduce this guy and get him to throw the game. He has that same silly expression Sanji has when he looks at me.)

1-female_must_strip=calm.png,That seemed to work for me.

1-female_must_strip=smiling.png,Winning in this game will never get old.
1-female_must_strip=win.png,Oh, yeah! I'm unstoppable.
1-female_must_strip=thinking.png,You can ask another player to help you undress? I didn't know that.
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lotte&stage;0:=smiling.png,Are you pretending you're a witch? Aren't you a little too old to play games? Though I guess you're not hurting anyone.
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;jessie&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I don't think I've ever met someone who works in <i>that kind of stuff</i>. But you seem very easy to talk to, Jessie.
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;haru&stage;0-2:=smiling.png,I wonder if that hair is softer than Chopper's fur. Would it be weird if I touch it?
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;2:=thinking.png,I've seen a lot of weird stuff sailing with my crew, but everything can still be explained. That's why I don't believe in magic. Are you sure you didn't eat a Devil Fruit without noticing? It happens.
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;0:=sad.png,Scary looking woman... (She reminds me a little of Robin when I first met her.)

1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;erufuda:=smiling.png,From what I see, you like fries <i>a lot</i>.
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;estelle&stage;0:=smiling.png,That's a fancy outfit you have. Are you rich? Perhaps... a princess?
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;mythra&stage;0:=thinking.png,That's a very elaborate... dress? Armor? Hmm, it's a little revealing to be armor.
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;jolyne&stage;0:=smiling.png,That's a very unique look you have, Jolyne. If you were a wanted criminal, you'd be very easy to find, hahah...
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;0:=smiling.png,That's an adorable witch outfit. This isn't a costume party, though.
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;0:=smiling.png,This is just a wild guess, but you like the color pink, don't you?
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;haru&stage;5&sayingmarker;seductingplayer:=sad.png,Where did the sweet, gentle Haru go?
1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;1:=calm.png,Why do you keep talking about magic, ~name~? Magic isn't real.
1-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:fighter,oneShotId:118=smug.png,A fighter, huh? I'm sure you're no match for Luffy.
1-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:fighter,oneShotId:118=annoyed.png,So you're a fighter. It's a good thing my crew mates are not here, or some of them would be eager to get into a fight with her for no reason.
1-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:ginger,oneShotId:236,priority:200=smiling.png,Nice hair, ~name~. Heheh...

1-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:princess,oneShotId:116=smiling.png,You're a princess? You wouldn't happen to know Vivi, right? She's the princess of the Kingdom of Alabasta. I haven't talked to her in a while.
1-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:princess,oneShotId:116=smiling.png,You're a princess, right? I've met a few, I know what they look like.
1-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:princess,oneShotId:116=greedy.png,Oh, a princess! I bet your kingdom is rich and powerful. Those clothes you're wearing look expensive...
1-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:scantily-clad,oneShotId:115,priority:220=happy.png,And people say that I dress inappropriately. That's still a cute outfit, though...
1-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:scantily-clad,oneShotId:115,priority:220=happy.png,I don't see anything indecent about that outfit, but I also don't consider my own look inappropriate and people are always bugging me about me. What do you think, ~player~?
1-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:school_uniform,oneShotId:114=serious.png,You... look a little young to be here. If you're as young as you look, you should leave now.
1-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:school_uniform,oneShotId:114=serious.png,Doesn't that uniform mean you're still in school? Then what do you think you're doing here?
1-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:0=serious.png,What kind of attire is that? (She barely looks human.)
1-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5=serious.png,What are you waiting for? You don't have any more clothes, do you?
1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You look like you come from a different civilization... or you have a very interesting sense of fashion. Either way, I like your outfit.
1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=annoyed.png,You were already naked before you grew those flowers. I don't like cheaters; but if you're going to do it, at least try to be subtle.
1-female_must_strip,target:cammy_white,targetStage:0=thinking.png,That's a nice leotard you're wearing... if a little tight, maybe.
1-female_must_strip,target:cammy_white,targetStage:3=smug.png,You're taking off your leotard now? Now we'll see just how tight it really is.

1-female_must_strip,target:caulifla,targetStage:1=serious.png,What are you doing? (Doesn't she know she has to strip now?)
1-female_must_strip,target:caulifla,targetStage:2=smug.png,You think you're so strong because you can turn your hair yellow? I'm sure my crew mates are stronger than you.
1-female_must_strip,target:caulifla,targetStage:4=smiling.png,Going back to black? Did you get tired of being blonde?
1-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You are a fighter, huh? Do you fight using kicks? (Those legs...)
1-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=calm.png,Are you a princess, Elizabeth? You're so well mannered and properly dressed that I'd find it hard to believe you're not from a wealthy family.
1-female_must_strip,target:emi,targetStage:0-1,targetSaidMarker:800m,targetSayingMarker:800m2=smug.png,You're very confident about your running skills, huh? But this is poker, so...
1-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0=sad.png,You look way too shy to play a game like this? Nobody is forcing you to play, right? Because if that's the case...
1-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=smiling.png,So you're a navigator too, huh? And we have similar hair? Maybe you're my lost little sister or something, hahah...
1-female_must_strip,target:hanako,targetStage:0=calm.png,Playing this game to overcome your shyness is a bold move. I suppose that means you're already making progress.

1-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=serious.png,So you're a clown... I'm sorry, I just haven't had the best experience with <i>clowns</i>.
1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=calm.png,A pirate woman, huh? That's refreshing considering I'm usually dealing with men.
1-female_must_strip,target:juri,targetStage:0=serious.png,(This woman is intense. Crazy even. I should avoid talking to her.)
1-female_must_strip,target:kizuna,targetStage:0=thinking.png,So what does A.I. mean? Additional Interest? Annoying... Individual?
1-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=thinking.png,I feel like I've seen wings like those on someone. And the pink color...
1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Who on their right mind bring a gun to a poker game?
1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:1=serious.png,Are you sick? I'd give you some of Chopper's medicine, but I don't like you very much.
1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=sad.png,You really are sick, aren't you? Fine, I'll give you the medicine.
1-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:keeping_camera=shocked.png,(A photographer? What if she's one of those Marines who take pictures for the wanted posters?)
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=thinking.png,That's an odd outfit. You look like a giant... strawberry.
1-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Did you say you're Dracula's daughter? You mean Dracule Mihawk, the Shichibukai?
1-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:1=smiling.png,Mavis, your look reminds me of Thriller Bark, for some reason. But it doesn't make sense, because you look like a nice girl and not like any of the monsters I saw there.
1-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=smiling.png,With that outfit, you clearly came from a winter island. Mei, right?
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=thinking.png,So you're a pirate? This is just a guess, but are you the captain by any chance?
1-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0=smiling.png,At last a normal, pleasant woman in this place. Nice to meet you, Misato.
1-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:3=thinking.png,Is something worrying you, Misato? Aside from having to undress...
1-female_must_strip,target:misty_hgss,targetStage:1=thinking.png,Misty, you look like you'd know. What are these <i>Pokermon</i> I've heard about?
1-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Why do you talk to ~player~ so casually, Monika? Do you two know each other?

1-female_must_strip,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=sad.png,Hey, little girl. You shouldn't be here. Did you get lost on your way to school? Let me help you...
1-female_must_strip,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=thinking.png,It's true what they say about small people making up for their stature with their personalities...
1-female_must_strip,target:natsuki,targetStage:6=serious.png,Okay, no point in throwing a tantrum, little lady.
1-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=thinking.png,I know pretty much anyone is allowed to play this game, but a ball of light? Really?
1-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:1=thinking.png,Are you part of that Tontatta Tribe from Dressrosa my crew told me about? You look like a fairy, at least.
1-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You have a very graceful look to you, Nayru. Kinda like what I imagine a goddess would look like.
1-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:3=thinking.png,Nayru, can I ask you about your ears? Are they part of your native race? I don't think I've ever met anyone with ears like that.
1-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=shocked.png,What is that thing...? A ghost?!
1-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Do you work here, ~name~? Is it okay for you to play?
1-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1=smiling.png,Did I mention how cute that maid outfit is? Not only that, but it's also very sexy.
1-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=smiling.png,A goddess, huh? I've met a god before, but you seem a lot more pleasant.
1-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:1=thinking.png,So what are your powers as a goddess? Just out of curiosity, you can't summon lighting, can you?
1-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=thinking.png,A female wrestler, huh? I can understand guys being into stuff like that, the guys in my crew sure are. But a woman?
1-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:2,targetSayingMarker:cammy_help,alsoPlaying:cammy_white,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=calm.png,Are you sure you wanna help her, Cammy? Mika seems nice and all, but...
1-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:2,targetSayingMarker:cammy_help,alsoPlaying:cammy_white,alsoPlayingStage:7=calm.png,Are you sure you wanna help her, Cammy? Mika seems nice and all, but...
1-female_must_strip,target:rarity_eg,targetStage:0=seductive.png,You're a fashion designer, huh? What do you think of my outfit? I know I look good, but a second opinion doesn't hurt.
1-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=smiling.png,Aren't you trying a little too hard to be scary with that outfit? I mean, it's not like there are real witches or...
1-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Those wings freak me out. They're scary instead of adorable like the ones in the sky people.
1-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=shocked.png,(I can tell this woman is bad news. And she's a bounty hunter? I should try to get along with her.)
1-female_must_strip,target:ribbon_girl,targetStage:0=thinking.png,You can stretch your arms? Just like Luffy.
1-female_must_strip,target:ribbon_girl,targetStage:2=thinking.png,So, your arms... Did you get them after eating a Devil Fruit?
1-female_must_strip,target:rin,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:artistunlucky=sad.png,I could understand living with one arm, but without both of them? I'd be completely useless.
1-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Why does that thing in your uniform that looks like an eye keep moving? It's freaking me out more than the sword.
1-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:mako,totalRounds:0=furious.png,Gah! You scared me! I thought there were no more players allowed.
1-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=serious.png,Finally that creepy uniform is coming off. I swear that eye keeps looking at me.
1-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=smiling.png,That sword really looks like half of a pair of scissors. Oh, it's called Scissor Blade? That makes sense, heheh...
1-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=thinking.png,Smoke? How is that uniform even built? I'm sure Franky would like to take a closer look at it.
1-female_must_strip,target:saki_zls,targetStage:6=serious.png,Okay, I'll accept you even if you're a zombie as long as you don't try to eat me.
1-female_must_strip,target:sakura,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You're an idol, right? Are you looking for a manager? I'm sure I'd do a great job!
1-female_must_strip,target:sakura,targetStage:3=smiling.png,Sorry for freaking out earlier, Sakura. Even if you're a zombie, you seem pretty cool.
1-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=thinking.png,White and blue... Is that some kind of weird, experimental Marine uniform?
1-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=thinking.png,This witch you keep talking about is just a game or something, right? If there was really a witch here, I'd be the first one to run away.
1-female_must_strip,target:sayori,targetStage:0=calm.png,I like your energy, but... you know you're playing strip poker, right?
1-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=calm.png,I really feel under dressed next to you. What do you need all the armor and equipment for, anyway?
1-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=calm.png,An assassin, huh? Robin was an assassin too before she joined the crew, and she seemed a lot scarier than you. So I have no problem with that.
1-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:4=smug.png,So you're down to your underwear... Huh?
1-female_must_strip,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Did you say earlier you're a ship? I think you're confused, young lady. I know ships, and even if they're very different, I've never seen one that looks like a person.
1-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=shocked.png,A GHOST!!! Why didn't I see it earlier?!
1-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:1=sad.png,If someone had told me that today I'd be playing strip poker with a ghost when I woke up, I'd have laughed.
1-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:2=serious.png,Why does a ghost wear clothes, anyway? Don't you just usually put a sheet on top of you?
1-female_must_strip,target:syrenne,targetStage:0=shocked.png,(Just my luck that I'm in the same table as a bounty hunter. At least it's a woman. Worst case scenario, maybe I can reason with her.)
1-female_must_strip,target:syrenne,targetStage:1=thinking.png,Shouldn't you focus on the game instead of drinking? What are you drinking, anyway?
1-female_must_strip,target:syrenne,targetStage:5=serious.png,I told you. You're lucky you didn't spill your drink when you were fully clothed.
1-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=smiling.png,Even for a princess, you're a lot more... colorful than what I'm used to.
1-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Are you a member of Germa 66? I don't think I've every seen anyone else wear an outfit like that.
1-female_must_strip,target:weiss_schnee,targetStage:0=happy.png,Mmmm, I definitely know how to recognize the richest person in this place. And here she is...
1-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Is that a skull on your sweater? Are you a pirate?
1-female_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:target2,test:~human.tag.lesbian~:false,marker:target2=thinking.png,(~Player~ looks naive. I can probably use my persuasion tactics to convince her into losing the game.)
1-female_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:target2,test:~human.tag.lesbian~:false,marker:target2=thinking.png,(~Player~ seems like the perfect girl to practice my manipulation skills on. If I can get her to lose, it would help me a great deal in this game.)
1-female_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:target2,test:~human.tag.lesbian~:false,marker:target2=thinking.png,(Who should I try to manipulate into losing the game? Hmmm, ~player~ seems like the perfect victim. She has those lost puppy eyes.)

2-male_must_strip=seductive.png,See? I'm more than just a cute navigator.
2-male_must_strip=embarrassed.png,You wanted to see me strip? I'm flattered, but my answer is no.
2-male_must_strip,count-role;target&character;ryuji&stage;0-4:=serious.png,(Is this guy a pirate? He seems to act like one. An inoffensive one, at least.)
2-male_must_strip,count-role;target&character;dust&stage;0:=happy.png,Oh, I didn't notice before you have a tail. You must be a Mink.
2-male_must_strip,count-role;target&character;n&stage;0:=sad.png,What kind of a name is <i>N</i>? It's gotta be fake. Oh, maybe I should've given a fake name too.
2-male_must_strip,target:human,filter:gay,notSaidMarker:target2,marker:target2=thinking.png,(Hmmm, ~player~ doesn't seem to be interested in me. Never mind, there are other ways to manipulate people besides seducing them.)
2-male_must_strip,target:human,filter:gay,notSaidMarker:target2,marker:target2=thinking.png,(I don't think ~player~ is attracted to women. But I'm sure I can convince him to lose using other tactics.)
2-male_must_strip,target:human,filter:gay,notSaidMarker:target2,marker:target2=thinking.png,(Is ~player~ not into women? He hasn't looked at me. Still, I'm confident I can convince him to lose the game through other means.)

2-male_must_strip,target:kamina,targetStage:0=serious.png,Who's this guy? He's like a Franky without the robot parts. I feel like he's gonna scream <i>Suuuper</i> at any moment.
2-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You're an Skypiean, right? Heso! Did you come down to the surface just to play this game?
2-male_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:target1,test:~human.tag.gay~:false,marker:target1=thinking.png,(I bet I can seduce this guy and get him to throw the game. He has that same silly expression Sanji has when he looks at me.)
2-male_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:target1,test:~human.tag.gay~:false,marker:target1=thinking.png,(~Player~ looks like the kind of man that is easy to manipulate for my own benefit. Just like Sanji.)
2-male_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:target1,test:~human.tag.gay~:false,marker:target1=thinking.png,(Hmmm, maybe I can seduce ~player~ into losing the game for me. It would sure help me to have one less opponent to defeat.)
2-female_must_strip=calm.png,Are you sure you wanna help her, Cammy? Mika seems nice and all, but...
2-female_must_strip=calm.png,Hey, don't feel bad. Maybe you won't lose the next round.
2-female_must_strip=smiling.png,Looks like I won this time.
2-female_must_strip=win.png,Yes! Let's keep on winning!
2-female_must_strip=greedy.png,Can we bet on what ~name~ is going to remove? It would be another chance to earn some money.
2-female_must_strip=win.png,Aren't I great at this game? Seems that way!
2-female_must_strip=thinking.png,You can ask another player to help you undress? I didn't know that.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lotte&stage;0:=smiling.png,Are you pretending you're a witch? Aren't you a little too old to play games? Though I guess you're not hurting anyone.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;jessie&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I don't think I've ever met someone who works in <i>that kind of stuff</i>. But you seem very easy to talk to, Jessie.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;haru&stage;0-2:=smiling.png,I wonder if that hair is softer than Chopper's fur. Would it be weird if I touch it?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;2:=thinking.png,I've seen a lot of weird stuff sailing with my crew, but everything can still be explained. That's why I don't believe in magic. Are you sure you didn't eat a Devil Fruit without noticing? It happens.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;0:=sad.png,Scary looking woman... (She reminds me a little of Robin when I first met her.)
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;erufuda:=smiling.png,So you like fries, huh? I can... see that.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;erufuda:=smiling.png,From what I see, you like fries <i>a lot</i>.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;estelle&stage;0:=smiling.png,That's a fancy outfit you have. Are you rich? Perhaps... a princess?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;mythra&stage;0:=thinking.png,That's a very elaborate... dress? Armor? Hmm, it's a little revealing to be armor.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;jolyne&stage;0:=smiling.png,That's a very unique look you have, Jolyne. If you were a wanted criminal, you'd be very easy to find, hahah...
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;0:=smiling.png,That's an adorable witch outfit. This isn't a costume party, though.
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;0:=smiling.png,This is just a wild guess, but you like the color pink, don't you?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;haru&stage;5&sayingmarker;seductingplayer:=sad.png,Where did the sweet, gentle Haru go?
2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;1:=calm.png,Why do you keep talking about magic, ~name~? Magic isn't real.
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:fighter,oneShotId:118=smug.png,A fighter, huh? I'm sure you're no match for Luffy.
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:fighter,oneShotId:118=annoyed.png,So you're a fighter. It's a good thing my crew mates are not here, or some of them would be eager to get into a fight with her for no reason.
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:ginger,oneShotId:236,priority:200=smiling.png,Nice hair, ~name~. Heheh...
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:ginger,oneShotId:236,priority:200=smiling.png,I really like your hair, ~name~. I don't know why.
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:non-human,oneShotId:117,priority:240=thinking.png,What a weird creature... Good thing Luffy isn't here, or he would ask her to join the crew.
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:non-human,oneShotId:117,priority:240=thinking.png,What is <i>that</i>? The sea really is a vast place...
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:princess,oneShotId:116=smiling.png,You're a princess? You wouldn't happen to know Vivi, right? She's the princess of the Kingdom of Alabasta. I haven't talked to her in a while.
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:princess,oneShotId:116=smiling.png,You're a princess, right? I've met a few, I know what they look like.
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:princess,oneShotId:116=greedy.png,Oh, a princess! I bet your kingdom is rich and powerful. Those clothes you're wearing look expensive...
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:scantily-clad,oneShotId:115,priority:220=happy.png,And people say that I dress inappropriately. That's still a cute outfit, though...
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:scantily-clad,oneShotId:115,priority:220=happy.png,I don't see anything indecent about that outfit, but I also don't consider my own look inappropriate and people are always bugging me about me. What do you think, ~player~?
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:school_uniform,oneShotId:114=serious.png,You... look a little young to be here. If you're as young as you look, you should leave now.
2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:school_uniform,oneShotId:114=serious.png,Doesn't that uniform mean you're still in school? Then what do you think you're doing here?
2-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:0=serious.png,What kind of attire is that? (She barely looks human.)
2-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5=serious.png,What are you waiting for? You don't have any more clothes, do you?
2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You look like you come from a different civilization... or you have a very interesting sense of fashion. Either way, I like your outfit.
2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=annoyed.png,You were already naked before you grew those flowers. I don't like cheaters; but if you're going to do it, at least try to be subtle.
2-female_must_strip,target:cammy_white,targetStage:0=thinking.png,That's a nice leotard you're wearing... if a little tight, maybe.
2-female_must_strip,target:cammy_white,targetStage:3=smug.png,You're taking off your leotard now? Now we'll see just how tight it really is.
2-female_must_strip,target:cammy_white,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:chunli_help,alsoPlaying:chun-li,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=thinking.png,You can ask another player to help you undress? I didn't know that.

2-female_must_strip,target:caulifla,targetStage:0=thinking.png,That's some crazy hair you have. Did you eat a Devil Fruit that lets you transform into a hedgehog or something?
2-female_must_strip,target:caulifla,targetStage:1=serious.png,What are you doing? (Doesn't she know she has to strip now?)
2-female_must_strip,target:caulifla,targetStage:2=smug.png,You think you're so strong because you can turn your hair yellow? I'm sure my crew mates are stronger than you.
2-female_must_strip,target:caulifla,targetStage:4=smiling.png,Going back to black? Did you get tired of being blonde?
2-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You are a fighter, huh? Do you fight using kicks? (Those legs...)
2-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=calm.png,Are you a princess, Elizabeth? You're so well mannered and properly dressed that I'd find it hard to believe you're not from a wealthy family.
2-female_must_strip,target:emi,targetStage:0-1,targetSaidMarker:800m,targetSayingMarker:800m2=smug.png,You're very confident about your running skills, huh? But this is poker, so...
2-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0=sad.png,You look way too shy to play a game like this? Nobody is forcing you to play, right? Because if that's the case...
2-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=smiling.png,So you're a navigator too, huh? And we have similar hair? Maybe you're my lost little sister or something, hahah...
2-female_must_strip,target:hanako,targetStage:0=calm.png,Playing this game to overcome your shyness is a bold move. I suppose that means you're already making progress.

2-female_must_strip,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=sad.png,Hey, little girl. You shouldn't be here. Did you get lost on your way to school? Let me help you...
2-female_must_strip,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=thinking.png,It's true what they say about small people making up for their stature with their personalities...
2-female_must_strip,target:natsuki,targetStage:6=serious.png,Okay, no point in throwing a tantrum, little lady.
2-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=thinking.png,I know pretty much anyone is allowed to play this game, but a ball of light? Really?
2-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:1=thinking.png,Are you part of that Tontatta Tribe from Dressrosa my crew told me about? You look like a fairy, at least.
2-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You have a very graceful look to you, Nayru. Kinda like what I imagine a goddess would look like.
2-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:3=thinking.png,Nayru, can I ask you about your ears? Are they part of your native race? I don't think I've ever met anyone with ears like that.
2-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=shocked.png,What is that thing...? A ghost?!
2-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Do you work here, ~name~? Is it okay for you to play?
2-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1=smiling.png,Did I mention how cute that maid outfit is? Not only that, but it's also very sexy.
2-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=smiling.png,A goddess, huh? I've met a god before, but you seem a lot more pleasant.
2-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:1=thinking.png,So what are your powers as a goddess? Just out of curiosity, you can't summon lighting, can you?
2-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=thinking.png,A female wrestler, huh? I can understand guys being into stuff like that, the guys in my crew sure are. But a woman?
2-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:2,targetSayingMarker:cammy_help,alsoPlaying:cammy_white,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=calm.png,Are you sure you wanna help her, Cammy? Mika seems nice and all, but...
2-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:2,targetSayingMarker:cammy_help,alsoPlaying:cammy_white,alsoPlayingStage:7=calm.png,Are you sure you wanna help her, Cammy? Mika seems nice and all, but...
2-female_must_strip,target:rarity_eg,targetStage:0=seductive.png,You're a fashion designer, huh? What do you think of my outfit? I know I look good, but a second opinion doesn't hurt.
2-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=smiling.png,Aren't you trying a little too hard to be scary with that outfit? I mean, it's not like there are real witches or...
2-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Those wings freak me out. They're scary instead of adorable like the ones in the sky people.
2-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=shocked.png,(I can tell this woman is bad news. And she's a bounty hunter? I should try to get along with her.)
2-female_must_strip,target:ribbon_girl,targetStage:0=thinking.png,You can stretch your arms? Just like Luffy.
2-female_must_strip,target:ribbon_girl,targetStage:2=thinking.png,So, your arms... Did you get them after eating a Devil Fruit?
2-female_must_strip,target:rin,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:artistunlucky=sad.png,I could understand living with one arm, but without both of them? I'd be completely useless.
2-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Why does that thing in your uniform that looks like an eye keep moving? It's freaking me out more than the sword.
2-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:mako,totalRounds:0=furious.png,Gah! You scared me! I thought there were no more players allowed.
2-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=serious.png,Finally that creepy uniform is coming off. I swear that eye keeps looking at me.
2-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=smiling.png,That sword really looks like half of a pair of scissors. Oh, it's called Scissor Blade? That makes sense, heheh...
2-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=thinking.png,Smoke? How is that uniform even built? I'm sure Franky would like to take a closer look at it.
2-female_must_strip,target:saki_zls,targetStage:6=serious.png,Okay, I'll accept you even if you're a zombie as long as you don't try to eat me.
2-female_must_strip,target:sakura,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You're an idol, right? Are you looking for a manager? I'm sure I'd do a great job!
2-female_must_strip,target:sakura,targetStage:3=smiling.png,Sorry for freaking out earlier, Sakura. Even if you're a zombie, you seem pretty cool.
2-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=thinking.png,White and blue... Is that some kind of weird, experimental Marine uniform?
2-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=thinking.png,This witch you keep talking about is just a game or something, right? If there was really a witch here, I'd be the first one to run away.
2-female_must_strip,target:sayori,targetStage:0=calm.png,I like your energy, but... you know you're playing strip poker, right?
2-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=calm.png,I really feel under dressed next to you. What do you need all the armor and equipment for, anyway?
2-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=calm.png,An assassin, huh? Robin was an assassin too before she joined the crew, and she seemed a lot scarier than you. So I have no problem with that.
2-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:4=smug.png,So you're down to your underwear... Huh?
2-female_must_strip,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Did you say earlier you're a ship? I think you're confused, young lady. I know ships, and even if they're very different, I've never seen one that looks like a person.
2-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=shocked.png,A GHOST!!! Why didn't I see it earlier?!
2-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:1=sad.png,If someone had told me that today I'd be playing strip poker with a ghost when I woke up, I'd have laughed.
2-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:2=serious.png,Why does a ghost wear clothes, anyway? Don't you just usually put a sheet on top of you?
2-female_must_strip,target:syrenne,targetStage:0=shocked.png,(Just my luck that I'm in the same table as a bounty hunter. At least it's a woman. Worst case scenario, maybe I can reason with her.)
2-female_must_strip,target:syrenne,targetStage:1=thinking.png,Shouldn't you focus on the game instead of drinking? What are you drinking, anyway?
2-female_must_strip,target:syrenne,targetStage:5=serious.png,I told you. You're lucky you didn't spill your drink when you were fully clothed.
2-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=smiling.png,Even for a princess, you're a lot more... colorful than what I'm used to.
2-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Are you a member of Germa 66? I don't think I've every seen anyone else wear an outfit like that.
2-female_must_strip,target:weiss_schnee,targetStage:0=happy.png,Mmmm, I definitely know how to recognize the richest person in this place. And here she is...
2-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Is that a skull on your sweater? Are you a pirate?
2-female_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:target2,test:~human.tag.lesbian~:false,marker:target2=thinking.png,(~Player~ looks naive. I can probably use my persuasion tactics to convince her into losing the game.)
2-female_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:target2,test:~human.tag.lesbian~:false,marker:target2=thinking.png,(~Player~ seems like the perfect girl to practice my manipulation skills on. If I can get her to lose, it would help me a great deal in this game.)
2-female_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:target2,test:~human.tag.lesbian~:false,marker:target2=thinking.png,(Who should I try to manipulate into losing the game? Hmmm, ~player~ seems like the perfect victim. She has those lost puppy eyes.)


#lost sandals
3-male_must_strip=smug.png,Okay, ~name~! Let's go, time to pay.
3-male_must_strip=smiling.png,Whew! That's one less round I need to win.
3-male_must_strip=win.png,Nice! ~Name~ lost? Well, I don't really care. I'm just happy it's not me.
3-male_must_strip,count-role;target&character;ryuji&stage;0-4:=serious.png,(Is this guy a pirate? He seems to act like one. An inoffensive one, at least.)
3-male_must_strip,count-role;target&character;dust&stage;0:=happy.png,Oh, I didn't notice before you have a tail. You must be a Mink.
3-male_must_strip,count-role;target&character;n&stage;0:=sad.png,What kind of a name is <i>N</i>? It's gotta be fake. Oh, maybe I should've given a fake name too.
3-male_must_strip,target:human,filter:gay,notSaidMarker:target2,marker:target2=thinking.png,(Hmmm, ~player~ doesn't seem to be interested in me. Never mind, there are other ways to manipulate people besides seducing them.)
3-male_must_strip,target:human,filter:gay,notSaidMarker:target2,marker:target2=thinking.png,(I don't think ~player~ is attracted to women. But I'm sure I can convince him to lose using other tactics.)
3-male_must_strip,target:human,filter:gay,notSaidMarker:target2,marker:target2=thinking.png,(Is ~player~ not into women? He hasn't looked at me. Still, I'm confident I can convince him to lose the game through other means.)
3-male_must_strip,target:jotaro,targetStage:0=shocked.png,(This guy seems scary. I better don't stand too close to him.)
3-male_must_strip,target:kamina,targetStage:0=serious.png,Who's this guy? He's like a Franky without the robot parts. I feel like he's gonna scream <i>Suuuper</i> at any moment.
3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You're an Skypiean, right? Heso! Did you come down to the surface just to play this game?
3-male_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:target1,test:~human.tag.gay~:false,marker:target1=thinking.png,(I bet I can seduce this guy and get him to throw the game. He has that same silly expression Sanji has when he looks at me.)
3-male_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:target1,test:~human.tag.gay~:false,marker:target1=thinking.png,(~Player~ looks like the kind of man that is easy to manipulate for my own benefit. Just like Sanji.)
3-male_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:target1,test:~human.tag.gay~:false,marker:target1=thinking.png,(Hmmm, maybe I can seduce ~player~ into losing the game for me. It would sure help me to have one less opponent to defeat.)
3-female_must_strip=calm.png,Are you sure you wanna help her, Cammy? Mika seems nice and all, but...
3-female_must_strip=calm.png,Good job, everyone! Well, except for ~name~.
3-female_must_strip=greedy.png,I can already feel that exciting treasure nearby... I mean, prize.
3-female_must_strip=smug.png,I'm much more than meets the eye.
3-female_must_strip=win.png,I made it! Another one is in the bag.
3-female_must_strip=win.png,Hehehe! I love winning!
3-female_must_strip=thinking.png,You can ask another player to help you undress? I didn't know that.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lotte&stage;0:=smiling.png,Are you pretending you're a witch? Aren't you a little too old to play games? Though I guess you're not hurting anyone.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;jessie&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I don't think I've ever met someone who works in <i>that kind of stuff</i>. But you seem very easy to talk to, Jessie.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;haru&stage;0-2:=smiling.png,I wonder if that hair is softer than Chopper's fur. Would it be weird if I touch it?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;2:=thinking.png,I've seen a lot of weird stuff sailing with my crew, but everything can still be explained. That's why I don't believe in magic. Are you sure you didn't eat a Devil Fruit without noticing? It happens.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;0:=sad.png,Scary looking woman... (She reminds me a little of Robin when I first met her.)
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;erufuda:=smiling.png,So you like fries, huh? I can... see that.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;erufuda:=smiling.png,From what I see, you like fries <i>a lot</i>.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;estelle&stage;0:=smiling.png,That's a fancy outfit you have. Are you rich? Perhaps... a princess?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;mythra&stage;0:=thinking.png,That's a very elaborate... dress? Armor? Hmm, it's a little revealing to be armor.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;jolyne&stage;0:=smiling.png,That's a very unique look you have, Jolyne. If you were a wanted criminal, you'd be very easy to find, hahah...
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;0:=smiling.png,That's an adorable witch outfit. This isn't a costume party, though.
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;0:=smiling.png,This is just a wild guess, but you like the color pink, don't you?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;haru&stage;5&sayingmarker;seductingplayer:=sad.png,Where did the sweet, gentle Haru go?
3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;1:=calm.png,Why do you keep talking about magic, ~name~? Magic isn't real.
3-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:fighter,oneShotId:118=smug.png,A fighter, huh? I'm sure you're no match for Luffy.
3-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:fighter,oneShotId:118=annoyed.png,So you're a fighter. It's a good thing my crew mates are not here, or some of them would be eager to get into a fight with her for no reason.
3-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:ginger,oneShotId:236,priority:200=smiling.png,Nice hair, ~name~. Heheh...
3-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:ginger,oneShotId:236,priority:200=smiling.png,I really like your hair, ~name~. I don't know why.
3-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:non-human,oneShotId:117,priority:240=thinking.png,What a weird creature... Good thing Luffy isn't here, or he would ask her to join the crew.
3-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:non-human,oneShotId:117,priority:240=thinking.png,What is <i>that</i>? The sea really is a vast place...
3-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:princess,oneShotId:116=smiling.png,You're a princess? You wouldn't happen to know Vivi, right? She's the princess of the Kingdom of Alabasta. I haven't talked to her in a while.
3-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:princess,oneShotId:116=smiling.png,You're a princess, right? I've met a few, I know what they look like.
3-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:princess,oneShotId:116=greedy.png,Oh, a princess! I bet your kingdom is rich and powerful. Those clothes you're wearing look expensive...
3-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:scantily-clad,oneShotId:115,priority:220=happy.png,And people say that I dress inappropriately. That's still a cute outfit, though...
3-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:scantily-clad,oneShotId:115,priority:220=happy.png,I don't see anything indecent about that outfit, but I also don't consider my own look inappropriate and people are always bugging me about me. What do you think, ~player~?
3-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:school_uniform,oneShotId:114=serious.png,You... look a little young to be here. If you're as young as you look, you should leave now.
3-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:school_uniform,oneShotId:114=serious.png,Doesn't that uniform mean you're still in school? Then what do you think you're doing here?
3-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:0=serious.png,What kind of attire is that? (She barely looks human.)
3-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5=serious.png,What are you waiting for? You don't have any more clothes, do you?
3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You look like you come from a different civilization... or you have a very interesting sense of fashion. Either way, I like your outfit.
3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=annoyed.png,You were already naked before you grew those flowers. I don't like cheaters; but if you're going to do it, at least try to be subtle.
3-female_must_strip,target:cammy_white,targetStage:0=thinking.png,That's a nice leotard you're wearing... if a little tight, maybe.
3-female_must_strip,target:cammy_white,targetStage:3=smug.png,You're taking off your leotard now? Now we'll see just how tight it really is.
3-female_must_strip,target:cammy_white,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:chunli_help,alsoPlaying:chun-li,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=thinking.png,You can ask another player to help you undress? I didn't know that.
3-female_must_strip,target:cammy_white,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:chunli_help,alsoPlaying:chun-li,alsoPlayingStage:10=thinking.png,You can ask another player to help you undress? I didn't know that.
3-female_must_strip,target:caulifla,targetStage:0=thinking.png,That's some crazy hair you have. Did you eat a Devil Fruit that lets you transform into a hedgehog or something?
3-female_must_strip,target:caulifla,targetStage:1=serious.png,What are you doing? (Doesn't she know she has to strip now?)
3-female_must_strip,target:caulifla,targetStage:2=smug.png,You think you're so strong because you can turn your hair yellow? I'm sure my crew mates are stronger than you.
3-female_must_strip,target:caulifla,targetStage:4=smiling.png,Going back to black? Did you get tired of being blonde?
3-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You are a fighter, huh? Do you fight using kicks? (Those legs...)
3-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=calm.png,Are you a princess, Elizabeth? You're so well mannered and properly dressed that I'd find it hard to believe you're not from a wealthy family.
3-female_must_strip,target:emi,targetStage:0-1,targetSaidMarker:800m,targetSayingMarker:800m2=smug.png,You're very confident about your running skills, huh? But this is poker, so...
3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0=sad.png,You look way too shy to play a game like this? Nobody is forcing you to play, right? Because if that's the case...
3-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=smiling.png,So you're a navigator too, huh? And we have similar hair? Maybe you're my lost little sister or something, hahah...
3-female_must_strip,target:hanako,targetStage:0=calm.png,Playing this game to overcome your shyness is a bold move. I suppose that means you're already making progress.
3-female_must_strip,target:human,filter:lesbian,notSaidMarker:target1,marker:target1=thinking.png,(~Player~ has been looking at me <i>a lot</i> since the game begun. Is she attracted to women? I could try seducing her into losing the game.)
3-female_must_strip,target:human,filter:lesbian,notSaidMarker:target1,marker:target1=thinking.png,(It seems ~player~ is into women. I've never tried seducing another girl, but if I can get her to lose for me, it should be worth it.)
3-female_must_strip,target:human,filter:lesbian,notSaidMarker:target1,marker:target1=thinking.png,(Why does ~player~ look at me like that? Does she like girls? If I can make her lose by seducing her I'll be one step closer to the prize.)
3-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=serious.png,So you're a clown... I'm sorry, I just haven't had the best experience with <i>clowns</i>.
3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=calm.png,A pirate woman, huh? That's refreshing considering I'm usually dealing with men.
3-female_must_strip,target:juri,targetStage:0=serious.png,(This woman is intense. Crazy even. I should avoid talking to her.)
3-female_must_strip,target:kizuna,targetStage:0=thinking.png,So what does A.I. mean? Additional Interest? Annoying... Individual?
3-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=thinking.png,I feel like I've seen wings like those on someone. And the pink color...
3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Who on their right mind bring a gun to a poker game?
3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:1=serious.png,Are you sick? I'd give you some of Chopper's medicine, but I don't like you very much.
3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=sad.png,You really are sick, aren't you? Fine, I'll give you the medicine.
3-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:keeping_camera=shocked.png,(A photographer? What if she's one of those Marines who take pictures for the wanted posters?)
3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=thinking.png,That's an odd outfit. You look like a giant... strawberry.
3-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Did you say you're Dracula's daughter? You mean Dracule Mihawk, the Shichibukai?
3-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:1=smiling.png,Mavis, your look reminds me of Thriller Bark, for some reason. But it doesn't make sense, because you look like a nice girl and not like any of the monsters I saw there.
3-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=smiling.png,With that outfit, you clearly came from a winter island. Mei, right?
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=thinking.png,So you're a pirate? This is just a guess, but are you the captain by any chance?
3-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0=smiling.png,At last a normal, pleasant woman in this place. Nice to meet you, Misato.
3-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:3=thinking.png,Is something worrying you, Misato? Aside from having to undress...
3-female_must_strip,target:misty_hgss,targetStage:1=thinking.png,Misty, you look like you'd know. What are these <i>Pokermon</i> I've heard about?
3-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Why do you talk to ~player~ so casually, Monika? Do you two know each other?
3-female_must_strip,target:mulan,targetStage:0=thinking.png,(This is a woman disguised as a man, right? The outfit isn't flashy enough to be an Okama, so...)
3-female_must_strip,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=sad.png,Hey, little girl. You shouldn't be here. Did you get lost on your way to school? Let me help you...
3-female_must_strip,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=thinking.png,It's true what they say about small people making up for their stature with their personalities...
3-female_must_strip,target:natsuki,targetStage:6=serious.png,Okay, no point in throwing a tantrum, little lady.
3-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=thinking.png,I know pretty much anyone is allowed to play this game, but a ball of light? Really?
3-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:1=thinking.png,Are you part of that Tontatta Tribe from Dressrosa my crew told me about? You look like a fairy, at least.
3-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You have a very graceful look to you, Nayru. Kinda like what I imagine a goddess would look like.

3-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Do you work here, ~name~? Is it okay for you to play?
3-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1=smiling.png,Did I mention how cute that maid outfit is? Not only that, but it's also very sexy.
3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=smiling.png,A goddess, huh? I've met a god before, but you seem a lot more pleasant.
3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:1=thinking.png,So what are your powers as a goddess? Just out of curiosity, you can't summon lighting, can you?
3-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=thinking.png,A female wrestler, huh? I can understand guys being into stuff like that, the guys in my crew sure are. But a woman?
3-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:2,targetSayingMarker:cammy_help,alsoPlaying:cammy_white,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=calm.png,Are you sure you wanna help her, Cammy? Mika seems nice and all, but...
3-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:2,targetSayingMarker:cammy_help,alsoPlaying:cammy_white,alsoPlayingStage:7=calm.png,Are you sure you wanna help her, Cammy? Mika seems nice and all, but...

3-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=shocked.png,(I can tell this woman is bad news. And she's a bounty hunter? I should try to get along with her.)
3-female_must_strip,target:ribbon_girl,targetStage:0=thinking.png,You can stretch your arms? Just like Luffy.
3-female_must_strip,target:ribbon_girl,targetStage:2=thinking.png,So, your arms... Did you get them after eating a Devil Fruit?
3-female_must_strip,target:rin,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:artistunlucky=sad.png,I could understand living with one arm, but without both of them? I'd be completely useless.
3-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Why does that thing in your uniform that looks like an eye keep moving? It's freaking me out more than the sword.
3-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:mako,totalRounds:0=furious.png,Gah! You scared me! I thought there were no more players allowed.
3-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=serious.png,Finally that creepy uniform is coming off. I swear that eye keeps looking at me.
3-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=smiling.png,That sword really looks like half of a pair of scissors. Oh, it's called Scissor Blade? That makes sense, heheh...
3-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=thinking.png,Smoke? How is that uniform even built? I'm sure Franky would like to take a closer look at it.
3-female_must_strip,target:saki_zls,targetStage:6=serious.png,Okay, I'll accept you even if you're a zombie as long as you don't try to eat me.
3-female_must_strip,target:sakura,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You're an idol, right? Are you looking for a manager? I'm sure I'd do a great job!
3-female_must_strip,target:sakura,targetStage:3=smiling.png,Sorry for freaking out earlier, Sakura. Even if you're a zombie, you seem pretty cool.
3-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=thinking.png,White and blue... Is that some kind of weird, experimental Marine uniform?
3-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=thinking.png,This witch you keep talking about is just a game or something, right? If there was really a witch here, I'd be the first one to run away.
3-female_must_strip,target:sayori,targetStage:0=calm.png,I like your energy, but... you know you're playing strip poker, right?
3-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=calm.png,I really feel under dressed next to you. What do you need all the armor and equipment for, anyway?
3-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=calm.png,An assassin, huh? Robin was an assassin too before she joined the crew, and she seemed a lot scarier than you. So I have no problem with that.
3-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:4=smug.png,So you're down to your underwear... Huh?
3-female_must_strip,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Did you say earlier you're a ship? I think you're confused, young lady. I know ships, and even if they're very different, I've never seen one that looks like a person.
3-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=shocked.png,A GHOST!!! Why didn't I see it earlier?!
3-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:1=sad.png,If someone had told me that today I'd be playing strip poker with a ghost when I woke up, I'd have laughed.
3-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:2=serious.png,Why does a ghost wear clothes, anyway? Don't you just usually put a sheet on top of you?
3-female_must_strip,target:syrenne,targetStage:0=shocked.png,(Just my luck that I'm in the same table as a bounty hunter. At least it's a woman. Worst case scenario, maybe I can reason with her.)
3-female_must_strip,target:syrenne,targetStage:1=thinking.png,Shouldn't you focus on the game instead of drinking? What are you drinking, anyway?
3-female_must_strip,target:syrenne,targetStage:5=serious.png,I told you. You're lucky you didn't spill your drink when you were fully clothed.
3-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=smiling.png,Even for a princess, you're a lot more... colorful than what I'm used to.
3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Are you a member of Germa 66? I don't think I've every seen anyone else wear an outfit like that.
3-female_must_strip,target:weiss_schnee,targetStage:0=happy.png,Mmmm, I definitely know how to recognize the richest person in this place. And here she is...
3-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Is that a skull on your sweater? Are you a pirate?
3-female_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:target2,test:~human.tag.lesbian~:false,marker:target2=thinking.png,(~Player~ looks naive. I can probably use my persuasion tactics to convince her into losing the game.)
3-female_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:target2,test:~human.tag.lesbian~:false,marker:target2=thinking.png,(~Player~ seems like the perfect girl to practice my manipulation skills on. If I can get her to lose, it would help me a great deal in this game.)
3-female_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:target2,test:~human.tag.lesbian~:false,marker:target2=thinking.png,(Who should I try to manipulate into losing the game? Hmmm, ~player~ seems like the perfect victim. She has those lost puppy eyes.)


#lost jeans
4-male_must_strip=smug.png,That's what you get for underestimating me.
4-male_must_strip=serious.png,I assume you wanna win that prize too, ~name~. Too bad! It's gonna be all mine.
4-male_must_strip=win.png,Thank you for losing, ~name~!
4-male_must_strip,count-role;target&character;ryuji&stage;0-4:=serious.png,(Is this guy a pirate? He seems to act like one. An inoffensive one, at least.)
4-male_must_strip,count-role;target&character;dust&stage;0:=happy.png,Oh, I didn't notice before you have a tail. You must be a Mink.
4-male_must_strip,count-role;target&character;n&stage;0:=sad.png,What kind of a name is <i>N</i>? It's gotta be fake. Oh, maybe I should've given a fake name too.
4-male_must_strip,target:human,filter:gay,notSaidMarker:target2,marker:target2=thinking.png,(Hmmm, ~player~ doesn't seem to be interested in me. Never mind, there are other ways to manipulate people besides seducing them.)
4-male_must_strip,target:human,filter:gay,notSaidMarker:target2,marker:target2=thinking.png,(I don't think ~player~ is attracted to women. But I'm sure I can convince him to lose using other tactics.)
4-male_must_strip,target:human,filter:gay,notSaidMarker:target2,marker:target2=thinking.png,(Is ~player~ not into women? He hasn't looked at me. Still, I'm confident I can convince him to lose the game through other means.)
4-male_must_strip,target:jotaro,targetStage:0=shocked.png,(This guy seems scary. I better don't stand too close to him.)
4-male_must_strip,target:kamina,targetStage:0=serious.png,Who's this guy? He's like a Franky without the robot parts. I feel like he's gonna scream <i>Suuuper</i> at any moment.
4-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You're an Skypiean, right? Heso! Did you come down to the surface just to play this game?
4-male_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:target1,test:~human.tag.gay~:false,marker:target1=thinking.png,(I bet I can seduce this guy and get him to throw the game. He has that same silly expression Sanji has when he looks at me.)
4-male_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:target1,test:~human.tag.gay~:false,marker:target1=thinking.png,(~Player~ looks like the kind of man that is easy to manipulate for my own benefit. Just like Sanji.)
4-male_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:target1,test:~human.tag.gay~:false,marker:target1=thinking.png,(Hmmm, maybe I can seduce ~player~ into losing the game for me. It would sure help me to have one less opponent to defeat.)
4-female_must_strip=calm.png,Are you sure you wanna help her, Cammy? Mika seems nice and all, but...
4-female_must_strip=win.png,Mmmm! I love it when things go right for me.
4-female_must_strip=smug.png,I told you, I'm not messing around anymore.
4-female_must_strip=calm.png,It's unfortunate, but there's things in this world you can't do anything about but comply.
4-female_must_strip=thinking.png,Good, now I can relax. If only for a second...
4-female_must_strip=win.png,Yay! Winning is the best feeling!
4-female_must_strip=thinking.png,You can ask another player to help you undress? I didn't know that.
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lotte&stage;0:=smiling.png,Are you pretending you're a witch? Aren't you a little too old to play games? Though I guess you're not hurting anyone.
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;jessie&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I don't think I've ever met someone who works in <i>that kind of stuff</i>. But you seem very easy to talk to, Jessie.
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;haru&stage;0-2:=smiling.png,I wonder if that hair is softer than Chopper's fur. Would it be weird if I touch it?
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;2:=thinking.png,I've seen a lot of weird stuff sailing with my crew, but everything can still be explained. That's why I don't believe in magic. Are you sure you didn't eat a Devil Fruit without noticing? It happens.
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;0:=sad.png,Scary looking woman... (She reminds me a little of Robin when I first met her.)
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;erufuda:=smiling.png,So you like fries, huh? I can... see that.
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;erufuda:=smiling.png,From what I see, you like fries <i>a lot</i>.
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;estelle&stage;0:=smiling.png,That's a fancy outfit you have. Are you rich? Perhaps... a princess?
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;mythra&stage;0:=thinking.png,That's a very elaborate... dress? Armor? Hmm, it's a little revealing to be armor.
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;jolyne&stage;0:=smiling.png,That's a very unique look you have, Jolyne. If you were a wanted criminal, you'd be very easy to find, hahah...
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;0:=smiling.png,That's an adorable witch outfit. This isn't a costume party, though.
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;0:=smiling.png,This is just a wild guess, but you like the color pink, don't you?
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;haru&stage;5&sayingmarker;seductingplayer:=sad.png,Where did the sweet, gentle Haru go?
4-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;1:=calm.png,Why do you keep talking about magic, ~name~? Magic isn't real.
4-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:fighter,oneShotId:118=smug.png,A fighter, huh? I'm sure you're no match for Luffy.
4-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:fighter,oneShotId:118=annoyed.png,So you're a fighter. It's a good thing my crew mates are not here, or some of them would be eager to get into a fight with her for no reason.
4-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:ginger,oneShotId:236,priority:200=smiling.png,Nice hair, ~name~. Heheh...
4-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:ginger,oneShotId:236,priority:200=smiling.png,I really like your hair, ~name~. I don't know why.
4-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:non-human,oneShotId:117,priority:240=thinking.png,What a weird creature... Good thing Luffy isn't here, or he would ask her to join the crew.
4-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:non-human,oneShotId:117,priority:240=thinking.png,What is <i>that</i>? The sea really is a vast place...
4-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:princess,oneShotId:116=smiling.png,You're a princess? You wouldn't happen to know Vivi, right? She's the princess of the Kingdom of Alabasta. I haven't talked to her in a while.
4-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:princess,oneShotId:116=smiling.png,You're a princess, right? I've met a few, I know what they look like.
4-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:princess,oneShotId:116=greedy.png,Oh, a princess! I bet your kingdom is rich and powerful. Those clothes you're wearing look expensive...
4-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:scantily-clad,oneShotId:115,priority:220=happy.png,And people say that I dress inappropriately. That's still a cute outfit, though...
4-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:scantily-clad,oneShotId:115,priority:220=happy.png,I don't see anything indecent about that outfit, but I also don't consider my own look inappropriate and people are always bugging me about me. What do you think, ~player~?
4-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:school_uniform,oneShotId:114=serious.png,You... look a little young to be here. If you're as young as you look, you should leave now.
4-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:school_uniform,oneShotId:114=serious.png,Doesn't that uniform mean you're still in school? Then what do you think you're doing here?
4-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:0=serious.png,What kind of attire is that? (She barely looks human.)
4-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5=serious.png,What are you waiting for? You don't have any more clothes, do you?
4-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You look like you come from a different civilization... or you have a very interesting sense of fashion. Either way, I like your outfit.
4-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=annoyed.png,You were already naked before you grew those flowers. I don't like cheaters; but if you're going to do it, at least try to be subtle.
4-female_must_strip,target:cammy_white,targetStage:0=thinking.png,That's a nice leotard you're wearing... if a little tight, maybe.
4-female_must_strip,target:cammy_white,targetStage:3=smug.png,You're taking off your leotard now? Now we'll see just how tight it really is.
4-female_must_strip,target:cammy_white,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:chunli_help,alsoPlaying:chun-li,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=thinking.png,You can ask another player to help you undress? I didn't know that.
4-female_must_strip,target:cammy_white,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:chunli_help,alsoPlaying:chun-li,alsoPlayingStage:10=thinking.png,You can ask another player to help you undress? I didn't know that.
4-female_must_strip,target:caulifla,targetStage:0=thinking.png,That's some crazy hair you have. Did you eat a Devil Fruit that lets you transform into a hedgehog or something?
4-female_must_strip,target:caulifla,targetStage:1=serious.png,What are you doing? (Doesn't she know she has to strip now?)
4-female_must_strip,target:caulifla,targetStage:2=smug.png,You think you're so strong because you can turn your hair yellow? I'm sure my crew mates are stronger than you.
4-female_must_strip,target:caulifla,targetStage:4=smiling.png,Going back to black? Did you get tired of being blonde?
4-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You are a fighter, huh? Do you fight using kicks? (Those legs...)
4-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=calm.png,Are you a princess, Elizabeth? You're so well mannered and properly dressed that I'd find it hard to believe you're not from a wealthy family.
4-female_must_strip,target:emi,targetStage:0-1,targetSaidMarker:800m,targetSayingMarker:800m2=smug.png,You're very confident about your running skills, huh? But this is poker, so...
4-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0=sad.png,You look way too shy to play a game like this? Nobody is forcing you to play, right? Because if that's the case...
4-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=smiling.png,So you're a navigator too, huh? And we have similar hair? Maybe you're my lost little sister or something, hahah...
4-female_must_strip,target:hanako,targetStage:0=calm.png,Playing this game to overcome your shyness is a bold move. I suppose that means you're already making progress.
4-female_must_strip,target:human,filter:lesbian,notSaidMarker:target1,marker:target1=thinking.png,(~Player~ has been looking at me <i>a lot</i> since the game begun. Is she attracted to women? I could try seducing her into losing the game.)
4-female_must_strip,target:human,filter:lesbian,notSaidMarker:target1,marker:target1=thinking.png,(It seems ~player~ is into women. I've never tried seducing another girl, but if I can get her to lose for me, it should be worth it.)
4-female_must_strip,target:human,filter:lesbian,notSaidMarker:target1,marker:target1=thinking.png,(Why does ~player~ look at me like that? Does she like girls? If I can make her lose by seducing her I'll be one step closer to the prize.)
4-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=serious.png,So you're a clown... I'm sorry, I just haven't had the best experience with <i>clowns</i>.
4-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=calm.png,A pirate woman, huh? That's refreshing considering I'm usually dealing with men.
4-female_must_strip,target:juri,targetStage:0=serious.png,(This woman is intense. Crazy even. I should avoid talking to her.)
4-female_must_strip,target:kizuna,targetStage:0=thinking.png,So what does A.I. mean? Additional Interest? Annoying... Individual?
4-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=thinking.png,I feel like I've seen wings like those on someone. And the pink color...
4-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Who on their right mind bring a gun to a poker game?
4-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:1=serious.png,Are you sick? I'd give you some of Chopper's medicine, but I don't like you very much.
4-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=sad.png,You really are sick, aren't you? Fine, I'll give you the medicine.
4-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:keeping_camera=shocked.png,(A photographer? What if she's one of those Marines who take pictures for the wanted posters?)
4-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=thinking.png,That's an odd outfit. You look like a giant... strawberry.
4-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Did you say you're Dracula's daughter? You mean Dracule Mihawk, the Shichibukai?
4-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:1=smiling.png,Mavis, your look reminds me of Thriller Bark, for some reason. But it doesn't make sense, because you look like a nice girl and not like any of the monsters I saw there.
4-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=smiling.png,With that outfit, you clearly came from a winter island. Mei, right?
4-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=thinking.png,So you're a pirate? This is just a guess, but are you the captain by any chance?
4-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0=smiling.png,At last a normal, pleasant woman in this place. Nice to meet you, Misato.
4-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:3=thinking.png,Is something worrying you, Misato? Aside from having to undress...
4-female_must_strip,target:misty_hgss,targetStage:1=thinking.png,Misty, you look like you'd know. What are these <i>Pokermon</i> I've heard about?
4-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Why do you talk to ~player~ so casually, Monika? Do you two know each other?
4-female_must_strip,target:mulan,targetStage:0=thinking.png,(This is a woman disguised as a man, right? The outfit isn't flashy enough to be an Okama, so...)
4-female_must_strip,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=sad.png,Hey, little girl. You shouldn't be here. Did you get lost on your way to school? Let me help you...
4-female_must_strip,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=thinking.png,It's true what they say about small people making up for their stature with their personalities...
4-female_must_strip,target:natsuki,targetStage:6=serious.png,Okay, no point in throwing a tantrum, little lady.
4-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=thinking.png,I know pretty much anyone is allowed to play this game, but a ball of light? Really?
4-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:1=thinking.png,Are you part of that Tontatta Tribe from Dressrosa my crew told me about? You look like a fairy, at least.
4-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You have a very graceful look to you, Nayru. Kinda like what I imagine a goddess would look like.
4-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:3=thinking.png,Nayru, can I ask you about your ears? Are they part of your native race? I don't think I've ever met anyone with ears like that.
4-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=shocked.png,What is that thing...? A ghost?!
4-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Do you work here, ~name~? Is it okay for you to play?
4-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1=smiling.png,Did I mention how cute that maid outfit is? Not only that, but it's also very sexy.
4-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=smiling.png,A goddess, huh? I've met a god before, but you seem a lot more pleasant.
4-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:1=thinking.png,So what are your powers as a goddess? Just out of curiosity, you can't summon lighting, can you?
4-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=thinking.png,A female wrestler, huh? I can understand guys being into stuff like that, the guys in my crew sure are. But a woman?
4-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:2,targetSayingMarker:cammy_help,alsoPlaying:cammy_white,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=calm.png,Are you sure you wanna help her, Cammy? Mika seems nice and all, but...
4-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:2,targetSayingMarker:cammy_help,alsoPlaying:cammy_white,alsoPlayingStage:7=calm.png,Are you sure you wanna help her, Cammy? Mika seems nice and all, but...
4-female_must_strip,target:rarity_eg,targetStage:0=seductive.png,You're a fashion designer, huh? What do you think of my outfit? I know I look good, but a second opinion doesn't hurt.
4-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=smiling.png,Aren't you trying a little too hard to be scary with that outfit? I mean, it's not like there are real witches or...
4-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Those wings freak me out. They're scary instead of adorable like the ones in the sky people.
4-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=shocked.png,(I can tell this woman is bad news. And she's a bounty hunter? I should try to get along with her.)
4-female_must_strip,target:ribbon_girl,targetStage:0=thinking.png,You can stretch your arms? Just like Luffy.
4-female_must_strip,target:ribbon_girl,targetStage:2=thinking.png,So, your arms... Did you get them after eating a Devil Fruit?
4-female_must_strip,target:rin,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:artistunlucky=sad.png,I could understand living with one arm, but without both of them? I'd be completely useless.
4-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Why does that thing in your uniform that looks like an eye keep moving? It's freaking me out more than the sword.
4-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:mako,totalRounds:0=furious.png,Gah! You scared me! I thought there were no more players allowed.
4-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=serious.png,Finally that creepy uniform is coming off. I swear that eye keeps looking at me.
4-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=smiling.png,That sword really looks like half of a pair of scissors. Oh, it's called Scissor Blade? That makes sense, heheh...
4-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=thinking.png,Smoke? How is that uniform even built? I'm sure Franky would like to take a closer look at it.
4-female_must_strip,target:saki_zls,targetStage:6=serious.png,Okay, I'll accept you even if you're a zombie as long as you don't try to eat me.
4-female_must_strip,target:sakura,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You're an idol, right? Are you looking for a manager? I'm sure I'd do a great job!
4-female_must_strip,target:sakura,targetStage:3=smiling.png,Sorry for freaking out earlier, Sakura. Even if you're a zombie, you seem pretty cool.
4-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=thinking.png,White and blue... Is that some kind of weird, experimental Marine uniform?
4-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=thinking.png,This witch you keep talking about is just a game or something, right? If there was really a witch here, I'd be the first one to run away.
4-female_must_strip,target:sayori,targetStage:0=calm.png,I like your energy, but... you know you're playing strip poker, right?
4-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=calm.png,I really feel under dressed next to you. What do you need all the armor and equipment for, anyway?
4-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=calm.png,An assassin, huh? Robin was an assassin too before she joined the crew, and she seemed a lot scarier than you. So I have no problem with that.
4-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:4=smug.png,So you're down to your underwear... Huh?
4-female_must_strip,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Did you say earlier you're a ship? I think you're confused, young lady. I know ships, and even if they're very different, I've never seen one that looks like a person.
4-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=shocked.png,A GHOST!!! Why didn't I see it earlier?!
4-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:1=sad.png,If someone had told me that today I'd be playing strip poker with a ghost when I woke up, I'd have laughed.
4-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:2=serious.png,Why does a ghost wear clothes, anyway? Don't you just usually put a sheet on top of you?
4-female_must_strip,target:syrenne,targetStage:0=shocked.png,(Just my luck that I'm in the same table as a bounty hunter. At least it's a woman. Worst case scenario, maybe I can reason with her.)
4-female_must_strip,target:syrenne,targetStage:1=thinking.png,Shouldn't you focus on the game instead of drinking? What are you drinking, anyway?
4-female_must_strip,target:syrenne,targetStage:5=serious.png,I told you. You're lucky you didn't spill your drink when you were fully clothed.
4-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=smiling.png,Even for a princess, you're a lot more... colorful than what I'm used to.
4-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Are you a member of Germa 66? I don't think I've every seen anyone else wear an outfit like that.
4-female_must_strip,target:weiss_schnee,targetStage:0=happy.png,Mmmm, I definitely know how to recognize the richest person in this place. And here she is...
4-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Is that a skull on your sweater? Are you a pirate?
4-female_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:target2,test:~human.tag.lesbian~:false,marker:target2=thinking.png,(~Player~ looks naive. I can probably use my persuasion tactics to convince her into losing the game.)
4-female_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:target2,test:~human.tag.lesbian~:false,marker:target2=thinking.png,(~Player~ seems like the perfect girl to practice my manipulation skills on. If I can get her to lose, it would help me a great deal in this game.)
4-female_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:target2,test:~human.tag.lesbian~:false,marker:target2=thinking.png,(Who should I try to manipulate into losing the game? Hmmm, ~player~ seems like the perfect victim. She has those lost puppy eyes.)


#lost top
5-male_must_strip=smug.png,So you're not that good after all, ~name~...
5-male_must_strip=win.png,Yes! This victory is mine!
5-male_must_strip=happy.png,Ha! Oh, I'm not laughing at you... Not entirely.
5-male_must_strip,count-role;target&character;ryuji&stage;0-4:=serious.png,(Is this guy a pirate? He seems to act like one. An inoffensive one, at least.)
5-male_must_strip,count-role;target&character;dust&stage;0:=happy.png,Oh, I didn't notice before you have a tail. You must be a Mink.
5-male_must_strip,count-role;target&character;n&stage;0:=sad.png,What kind of a name is <i>N</i>? It's gotta be fake. Oh, maybe I should've given a fake name too.
5-male_must_strip,target:human,filter:gay,notSaidMarker:target2,marker:target2=thinking.png,(Hmmm, ~player~ doesn't seem to be interested in me. Never mind, there are other ways to manipulate people besides seducing them.)
5-male_must_strip,target:human,filter:gay,notSaidMarker:target2,marker:target2=thinking.png,(I don't think ~player~ is attracted to women. But I'm sure I can convince him to lose using other tactics.)
5-male_must_strip,target:human,filter:gay,notSaidMarker:target2,marker:target2=thinking.png,(Is ~player~ not into women? He hasn't looked at me. Still, I'm confident I can convince him to lose the game through other means.)
5-male_must_strip,target:jotaro,targetStage:0=shocked.png,(This guy seems scary. I better don't stand too close to him.)
5-male_must_strip,target:kamina,targetStage:0=serious.png,Who's this guy? He's like a Franky without the robot parts. I feel like he's gonna scream <i>Suuuper</i> at any moment.
5-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You're an Skypiean, right? Heso! Did you come down to the surface just to play this game?
5-male_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:target1,test:~human.tag.gay~:false,marker:target1=thinking.png,(I bet I can seduce this guy and get him to throw the game. He has that same silly expression Sanji has when he looks at me.)
5-male_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:target1,test:~human.tag.gay~:false,marker:target1=thinking.png,(~Player~ looks like the kind of man that is easy to manipulate for my own benefit. Just like Sanji.)
5-male_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:target1,test:~human.tag.gay~:false,marker:target1=thinking.png,(Hmmm, maybe I can seduce ~player~ into losing the game for me. It would sure help me to have one less opponent to defeat.)
5-female_must_strip=calm.png,Are you sure you wanna help her, Cammy? Mika seems nice and all, but...
5-female_must_strip=smiling.png,Heheheh, big catch, big catch!
5-female_must_strip=calm.png,Sorry, but I can't afford to play around anymore.
5-female_must_strip=smug.png,I knew ~name~ was gonna lose. How? I don't know... Woman's intuition?
5-female_must_strip=win.png,Sweet victory, here I come.
5-female_must_strip=win.png,Even if I'm half naked, I'm not gonna give up... <i>Especially</i> because I'm half naked!
5-female_must_strip=thinking.png,You can ask another player to help you undress? I didn't know that.
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lotte&stage;0:=smiling.png,Are you pretending you're a witch? Aren't you a little too old to play games? Though I guess you're not hurting anyone.
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;jessie&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I don't think I've ever met someone who works in <i>that kind of stuff</i>. But you seem very easy to talk to, Jessie.
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;haru&stage;0-2:=smiling.png,I wonder if that hair is softer than Chopper's fur. Would it be weird if I touch it?
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;2:=thinking.png,I've seen a lot of weird stuff sailing with my crew, but everything can still be explained. That's why I don't believe in magic. Are you sure you didn't eat a Devil Fruit without noticing? It happens.
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;0:=sad.png,Scary looking woman... (She reminds me a little of Robin when I first met her.)
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;erufuda:=smiling.png,So you like fries, huh? I can... see that.
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;erufuda:=smiling.png,From what I see, you like fries <i>a lot</i>.
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;estelle&stage;0:=smiling.png,That's a fancy outfit you have. Are you rich? Perhaps... a princess?
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;mythra&stage;0:=thinking.png,That's a very elaborate... dress? Armor? Hmm, it's a little revealing to be armor.
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;jolyne&stage;0:=smiling.png,That's a very unique look you have, Jolyne. If you were a wanted criminal, you'd be very easy to find, hahah...
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;0:=smiling.png,That's an adorable witch outfit. This isn't a costume party, though.
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;0:=smiling.png,This is just a wild guess, but you like the color pink, don't you?
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;haru&stage;5&sayingmarker;seductingplayer:=sad.png,Where did the sweet, gentle Haru go?
5-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;1:=calm.png,Why do you keep talking about magic, ~name~? Magic isn't real.
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:fighter,oneShotId:118=smug.png,A fighter, huh? I'm sure you're no match for Luffy.
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:fighter,oneShotId:118=annoyed.png,So you're a fighter. It's a good thing my crew mates are not here, or some of them would be eager to get into a fight with her for no reason.
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:ginger,oneShotId:236,priority:200=smiling.png,Nice hair, ~name~. Heheh...
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:ginger,oneShotId:236,priority:200=smiling.png,I really like your hair, ~name~. I don't know why.
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:non-human,oneShotId:117,priority:240=thinking.png,What a weird creature... Good thing Luffy isn't here, or he would ask her to join the crew.
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:non-human,oneShotId:117,priority:240=thinking.png,What is <i>that</i>? The sea really is a vast place...
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:princess,oneShotId:116=smiling.png,You're a princess? You wouldn't happen to know Vivi, right? She's the princess of the Kingdom of Alabasta. I haven't talked to her in a while.
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:princess,oneShotId:116=smiling.png,You're a princess, right? I've met a few, I know what they look like.
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:princess,oneShotId:116=greedy.png,Oh, a princess! I bet your kingdom is rich and powerful. Those clothes you're wearing look expensive...
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:scantily-clad,oneShotId:115,priority:220=happy.png,And people say that I dress inappropriately. That's still a cute outfit, though...
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:scantily-clad,oneShotId:115,priority:220=happy.png,I don't see anything indecent about that outfit, but I also don't consider my own look inappropriate and people are always bugging me about me. What do you think, ~player~?
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:school_uniform,oneShotId:114=serious.png,You... look a little young to be here. If you're as young as you look, you should leave now.
5-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:school_uniform,oneShotId:114=serious.png,Doesn't that uniform mean you're still in school? Then what do you think you're doing here?
5-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:0=serious.png,What kind of attire is that? (She barely looks human.)
5-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5=serious.png,What are you waiting for? You don't have any more clothes, do you?
5-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You look like you come from a different civilization... or you have a very interesting sense of fashion. Either way, I like your outfit.
5-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=annoyed.png,You were already naked before you grew those flowers. I don't like cheaters; but if you're going to do it, at least try to be subtle.
5-female_must_strip,target:cammy_white,targetStage:0=thinking.png,That's a nice leotard you're wearing... if a little tight, maybe.
5-female_must_strip,target:cammy_white,targetStage:3=smug.png,You're taking off your leotard now? Now we'll see just how tight it really is.
5-female_must_strip,target:cammy_white,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:chunli_help,alsoPlaying:chun-li,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=thinking.png,You can ask another player to help you undress? I didn't know that.
5-female_must_strip,target:cammy_white,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:chunli_help,alsoPlaying:chun-li,alsoPlayingStage:10=thinking.png,You can ask another player to help you undress? I didn't know that.
5-female_must_strip,target:caulifla,targetStage:0=thinking.png,That's some crazy hair you have. Did you eat a Devil Fruit that lets you transform into a hedgehog or something?
5-female_must_strip,target:caulifla,targetStage:1=serious.png,What are you doing? (Doesn't she know she has to strip now?)
5-female_must_strip,target:caulifla,targetStage:2=smug.png,You think you're so strong because you can turn your hair yellow? I'm sure my crew mates are stronger than you.
5-female_must_strip,target:caulifla,targetStage:4=smiling.png,Going back to black? Did you get tired of being blonde?
5-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You are a fighter, huh? Do you fight using kicks? (Those legs...)
5-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=calm.png,Are you a princess, Elizabeth? You're so well mannered and properly dressed that I'd find it hard to believe you're not from a wealthy family.
5-female_must_strip,target:emi,targetStage:0-1,targetSaidMarker:800m,targetSayingMarker:800m2=smug.png,You're very confident about your running skills, huh? But this is poker, so...
5-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0=sad.png,You look way too shy to play a game like this? Nobody is forcing you to play, right? Because if that's the case...
5-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=smiling.png,So you're a navigator too, huh? And we have similar hair? Maybe you're my lost little sister or something, hahah...
5-female_must_strip,target:hanako,targetStage:0=calm.png,Playing this game to overcome your shyness is a bold move. I suppose that means you're already making progress.
5-female_must_strip,target:human,filter:lesbian,notSaidMarker:target1,marker:target1=thinking.png,(~Player~ has been looking at me <i>a lot</i> since the game begun. Is she attracted to women? I could try seducing her into losing the game.)
5-female_must_strip,target:human,filter:lesbian,notSaidMarker:target1,marker:target1=thinking.png,(It seems ~player~ is into women. I've never tried seducing another girl, but if I can get her to lose for me, it should be worth it.)
5-female_must_strip,target:human,filter:lesbian,notSaidMarker:target1,marker:target1=thinking.png,(Why does ~player~ look at me like that? Does she like girls? If I can make her lose by seducing her I'll be one step closer to the prize.)
5-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=serious.png,So you're a clown... I'm sorry, I just haven't had the best experience with <i>clowns</i>.
5-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=calm.png,A pirate woman, huh? That's refreshing considering I'm usually dealing with men.
5-female_must_strip,target:juri,targetStage:0=serious.png,(This woman is intense. Crazy even. I should avoid talking to her.)
5-female_must_strip,target:kizuna,targetStage:0=thinking.png,So what does A.I. mean? Additional Interest? Annoying... Individual?
5-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=thinking.png,I feel like I've seen wings like those on someone. And the pink color...
5-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Who on their right mind bring a gun to a poker game?
5-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:1=serious.png,Are you sick? I'd give you some of Chopper's medicine, but I don't like you very much.
5-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=sad.png,You really are sick, aren't you? Fine, I'll give you the medicine.
5-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:keeping_camera=shocked.png,(A photographer? What if she's one of those Marines who take pictures for the wanted posters?)
5-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=thinking.png,That's an odd outfit. You look like a giant... strawberry.
5-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Did you say you're Dracula's daughter? You mean Dracule Mihawk, the Shichibukai?
5-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:1=smiling.png,Mavis, your look reminds me of Thriller Bark, for some reason. But it doesn't make sense, because you look like a nice girl and not like any of the monsters I saw there.
5-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=smiling.png,With that outfit, you clearly came from a winter island. Mei, right?
5-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=thinking.png,So you're a pirate? This is just a guess, but are you the captain by any chance?
5-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0=smiling.png,At last a normal, pleasant woman in this place. Nice to meet you, Misato.
5-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:3=thinking.png,Is something worrying you, Misato? Aside from having to undress...
5-female_must_strip,target:misty_hgss,targetStage:1=thinking.png,Misty, you look like you'd know. What are these <i>Pokermon</i> I've heard about?
5-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Why do you talk to ~player~ so casually, Monika? Do you two know each other?
5-female_must_strip,target:mulan,targetStage:0=thinking.png,(This is a woman disguised as a man, right? The outfit isn't flashy enough to be an Okama, so...)
5-female_must_strip,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=sad.png,Hey, little girl. You shouldn't be here. Did you get lost on your way to school? Let me help you...
5-female_must_strip,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=thinking.png,It's true what they say about small people making up for their stature with their personalities...
5-female_must_strip,target:natsuki,targetStage:6=serious.png,Okay, no point in throwing a tantrum, little lady.
5-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=thinking.png,I know pretty much anyone is allowed to play this game, but a ball of light? Really?
5-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:1=thinking.png,Are you part of that Tontatta Tribe from Dressrosa my crew told me about? You look like a fairy, at least.
5-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You have a very graceful look to you, Nayru. Kinda like what I imagine a goddess would look like.
5-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:3=thinking.png,Nayru, can I ask you about your ears? Are they part of your native race? I don't think I've ever met anyone with ears like that.
5-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=shocked.png,What is that thing...? A ghost?!
5-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Do you work here, ~name~? Is it okay for you to play?
5-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1=smiling.png,Did I mention how cute that maid outfit is? Not only that, but it's also very sexy.
5-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=smiling.png,A goddess, huh? I've met a god before, but you seem a lot more pleasant.
5-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:1=thinking.png,So what are your powers as a goddess? Just out of curiosity, you can't summon lighting, can you?
5-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=thinking.png,A female wrestler, huh? I can understand guys being into stuff like that, the guys in my crew sure are. But a woman?
5-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:2,targetSayingMarker:cammy_help,alsoPlaying:cammy_white,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=calm.png,Are you sure you wanna help her, Cammy? Mika seems nice and all, but...
5-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:2,targetSayingMarker:cammy_help,alsoPlaying:cammy_white,alsoPlayingStage:7=calm.png,Are you sure you wanna help her, Cammy? Mika seems nice and all, but...
5-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=smiling.png,Aren't you trying a little too hard to be scary with that outfit? I mean, it's not like there are real witches or...
5-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Those wings freak me out. They're scary instead of adorable like the ones in the sky people.
5-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=shocked.png,(I can tell this woman is bad news. And she's a bounty hunter? I should try to get along with her.)
5-female_must_strip,target:ribbon_girl,targetStage:0=thinking.png,You can stretch your arms? Just like Luffy.
5-female_must_strip,target:ribbon_girl,targetStage:2=thinking.png,So, your arms... Did you get them after eating a Devil Fruit?
5-female_must_strip,target:rin,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:artistunlucky=sad.png,I could understand living with one arm, but without both of them? I'd be completely useless.
5-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Why does that thing in your uniform that looks like an eye keep moving? It's freaking me out more than the sword.
5-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:mako,totalRounds:0=furious.png,Gah! You scared me! I thought there were no more players allowed.
5-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=serious.png,Finally that creepy uniform is coming off. I swear that eye keeps looking at me.
5-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=smiling.png,That sword really looks like half of a pair of scissors. Oh, it's called Scissor Blade? That makes sense, heheh...
5-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=thinking.png,Smoke? How is that uniform even built? I'm sure Franky would like to take a closer look at it.
5-female_must_strip,target:saki_zls,targetStage:6=serious.png,Okay, I'll accept you even if you're a zombie as long as you don't try to eat me.
5-female_must_strip,target:sakura,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You're an idol, right? Are you looking for a manager? I'm sure I'd do a great job!
5-female_must_strip,target:sakura,targetStage:3=smiling.png,Sorry for freaking out earlier, Sakura. Even if you're a zombie, you seem pretty cool.
5-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=thinking.png,White and blue... Is that some kind of weird, experimental Marine uniform?
5-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=thinking.png,This witch you keep talking about is just a game or something, right? If there was really a witch here, I'd be the first one to run away.
5-female_must_strip,target:sayori,targetStage:0=calm.png,I like your energy, but... you know you're playing strip poker, right?
5-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=calm.png,I really feel under dressed next to you. What do you need all the armor and equipment for, anyway?
5-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=calm.png,An assassin, huh? Robin was an assassin too before she joined the crew, and she seemed a lot scarier than you. So I have no problem with that.
5-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:4=smug.png,So you're down to your underwear... Huh?
5-female_must_strip,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Did you say earlier you're a ship? I think you're confused, young lady. I know ships, and even if they're very different, I've never seen one that looks like a person.
5-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=shocked.png,A GHOST!!! Why didn't I see it earlier?!
5-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:1=sad.png,If someone had told me that today I'd be playing strip poker with a ghost when I woke up, I'd have laughed.
5-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:2=serious.png,Why does a ghost wear clothes, anyway? Don't you just usually put a sheet on top of you?
5-female_must_strip,target:syrenne,targetStage:0=shocked.png,(Just my luck that I'm in the same table as a bounty hunter. At least it's a woman. Worst case scenario, maybe I can reason with her.)
5-female_must_strip,target:syrenne,targetStage:1=thinking.png,Shouldn't you focus on the game instead of drinking? What are you drinking, anyway?
5-female_must_strip,target:syrenne,targetStage:5=serious.png,I told you. You're lucky you didn't spill your drink when you were fully clothed.
5-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=smiling.png,Even for a princess, you're a lot more... colorful than what I'm used to.
5-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Are you a member of Germa 66? I don't think I've every seen anyone else wear an outfit like that.
5-female_must_strip,target:weiss_schnee,targetStage:0=happy.png,Mmmm, I definitely know how to recognize the richest person in this place. And here she is...
5-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Is that a skull on your sweater? Are you a pirate?
5-female_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:target2,test:~human.tag.lesbian~:false,marker:target2=thinking.png,(~Player~ looks naive. I can probably use my persuasion tactics to convince her into losing the game.)

-3-male_must_strip,target:human,filter:gay,notSaidMarker:target2,marker:target2=thinking.png,(I don't think ~player~ is attracted to women. But I'm sure I can convince him to lose using other tactics.)
-3-male_must_strip,target:human,filter:gay,notSaidMarker:target2,marker:target2=thinking.png,(Is ~player~ not into women? He hasn't looked at me. Still, I'm confident I can convince him to lose the game through other means.)
-3-male_must_strip,target:jotaro,targetStage:0=shocked.png,(This guy seems scary. I better don't stand too close to him.)
-3-male_must_strip,target:kamina,targetStage:0=serious.png,Who's this guy? He's like a Franky without the robot parts. I feel like he's gonna scream <i>Suuuper</i> at any moment.
-3-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You're an Skypiean, right? Heso! Did you come down to the surface just to play this game?
-3-male_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:target1,test:~human.tag.gay~:false,marker:target1=thinking.png,(I bet I can seduce this guy and get him to throw the game. He has that same silly expression Sanji has when he looks at me.)
-3-male_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:target1,test:~human.tag.gay~:false,marker:target1=thinking.png,(~Player~ looks like the kind of man that is easy to manipulate for my own benefit. Just like Sanji.)
-3-male_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:target1,test:~human.tag.gay~:false,marker:target1=thinking.png,(Hmmm, maybe I can seduce ~player~ into losing the game for me. It would sure help me to have one less opponent to defeat.)
-3-female_must_strip=calm.png,Are you sure you wanna help her, Cammy? Mika seems nice and all, but...
-3-female_must_strip=smug.png,This victory is mine! Any complaints?
-3-female_must_strip=win.png,Everything's okay for now! Now I just need to keep winning.
-3-female_must_strip=happy.png,Sorry, but I'm not gonna lose just yet.
-3-female_must_strip=smug.png,Sucks to be you.
-3-female_must_strip=win.png,Yes! I'm down, but I'm not defeated yet!
-3-female_must_strip=thinking.png,You can ask another player to help you undress? I didn't know that.
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lotte&stage;0:=smiling.png,Are you pretending you're a witch? Aren't you a little too old to play games? Though I guess you're not hurting anyone.
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;jessie&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I don't think I've ever met someone who works in <i>that kind of stuff</i>. But you seem very easy to talk to, Jessie.
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;haru&stage;0-2:=smiling.png,I wonder if that hair is softer than Chopper's fur. Would it be weird if I touch it?
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;2:=thinking.png,I've seen a lot of weird stuff sailing with my crew, but everything can still be explained. That's why I don't believe in magic. Are you sure you didn't eat a Devil Fruit without noticing? It happens.
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;0:=sad.png,Scary looking woman... (She reminds me a little of Robin when I first met her.)
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;erufuda:=smiling.png,So you like fries, huh? I can... see that.
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;erufuda:=smiling.png,From what I see, you like fries <i>a lot</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;estelle&stage;0:=smiling.png,That's a fancy outfit you have. Are you rich? Perhaps... a princess?
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;mythra&stage;0:=thinking.png,That's a very elaborate... dress? Armor? Hmm, it's a little revealing to be armor.
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;jolyne&stage;0:=smiling.png,That's a very unique look you have, Jolyne. If you were a wanted criminal, you'd be very easy to find, hahah...
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;0:=smiling.png,That's an adorable witch outfit. This isn't a costume party, though.
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;0:=smiling.png,This is just a wild guess, but you like the color pink, don't you?
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;haru&stage;5&sayingmarker;seductingplayer:=sad.png,Where did the sweet, gentle Haru go?
-3-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;1:=calm.png,Why do you keep talking about magic, ~name~? Magic isn't real.
-3-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:fighter,oneShotId:118=smug.png,A fighter, huh? I'm sure you're no match for Luffy.
-3-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:fighter,oneShotId:118=annoyed.png,So you're a fighter. It's a good thing my crew mates are not here, or some of them would be eager to get into a fight with her for no reason.
-3-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:ginger,oneShotId:236,priority:200=smiling.png,Nice hair, ~name~. Heheh...
-3-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:ginger,oneShotId:236,priority:200=smiling.png,I really like your hair, ~name~. I don't know why.
-3-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:non-human,oneShotId:117,priority:240=thinking.png,What a weird creature... Good thing Luffy isn't here, or he would ask her to join the crew.
-3-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:non-human,oneShotId:117,priority:240=thinking.png,What is <i>that</i>? The sea really is a vast place...
-3-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:princess,oneShotId:116=smiling.png,You're a princess? You wouldn't happen to know Vivi, right? She's the princess of the Kingdom of Alabasta. I haven't talked to her in a while.
-3-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:princess,oneShotId:116=smiling.png,You're a princess, right? I've met a few, I know what they look like.
-3-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:princess,oneShotId:116=greedy.png,Oh, a princess! I bet your kingdom is rich and powerful. Those clothes you're wearing look expensive...
-3-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:scantily-clad,oneShotId:115,priority:220=happy.png,And people say that I dress inappropriately. That's still a cute outfit, though...
-3-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:scantily-clad,oneShotId:115,priority:220=happy.png,I don't see anything indecent about that outfit, but I also don't consider my own look inappropriate and people are always bugging me about me. What do you think, ~player~?
-3-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:school_uniform,oneShotId:114=serious.png,You... look a little young to be here. If you're as young as you look, you should leave now.
-3-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:school_uniform,oneShotId:114=serious.png,Doesn't that uniform mean you're still in school? Then what do you think you're doing here?
-3-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:0=serious.png,What kind of attire is that? (She barely looks human.)
-3-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5=serious.png,What are you waiting for? You don't have any more clothes, do you?
-3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You look like you come from a different civilization... or you have a very interesting sense of fashion. Either way, I like your outfit.
-3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=annoyed.png,You were already naked before you grew those flowers. I don't like cheaters; but if you're going to do it, at least try to be subtle.
-3-female_must_strip,target:cammy_white,targetStage:0=thinking.png,That's a nice leotard you're wearing... if a little tight, maybe.
-3-female_must_strip,target:cammy_white,targetStage:3=smug.png,You're taking off your leotard now? Now we'll see just how tight it really is.
-3-female_must_strip,target:cammy_white,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:chunli_help,alsoPlaying:chun-li,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=thinking.png,You can ask another player to help you undress? I didn't know that.
-3-female_must_strip,target:cammy_white,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:chunli_help,alsoPlaying:chun-li,alsoPlayingStage:10=thinking.png,You can ask another player to help you undress? I didn't know that.
-3-female_must_strip,target:caulifla,targetStage:0=thinking.png,That's some crazy hair you have. Did you eat a Devil Fruit that lets you transform into a hedgehog or something?
-3-female_must_strip,target:caulifla,targetStage:1=serious.png,What are you doing? (Doesn't she know she has to strip now?)
-3-female_must_strip,target:caulifla,targetStage:2=smug.png,You think you're so strong because you can turn your hair yellow? I'm sure my crew mates are stronger than you.
-3-female_must_strip,target:caulifla,targetStage:4=smiling.png,Going back to black? Did you get tired of being blonde?
-3-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You are a fighter, huh? Do you fight using kicks? (Those legs...)
-3-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=calm.png,Are you a princess, Elizabeth? You're so well mannered and properly dressed that I'd find it hard to believe you're not from a wealthy family.
-3-female_must_strip,target:emi,targetStage:0-1,targetSaidMarker:800m,targetSayingMarker:800m2=smug.png,You're very confident about your running skills, huh? But this is poker, so...
-3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0=sad.png,You look way too shy to play a game like this? Nobody is forcing you to play, right? Because if that's the case...
-3-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=smiling.png,So you're a navigator too, huh? And we have similar hair? Maybe you're my lost little sister or something, hahah...
-3-female_must_strip,target:hanako,targetStage:0=calm.png,Playing this game to overcome your shyness is a bold move. I suppose that means you're already making progress.
-3-female_must_strip,target:human,filter:lesbian,notSaidMarker:target1,marker:target1=thinking.png,(~Player~ has been looking at me <i>a lot</i> since the game begun. Is she attracted to women? I could try seducing her into losing the game.)
-3-female_must_strip,target:human,filter:lesbian,notSaidMarker:target1,marker:target1=thinking.png,(It seems ~player~ is into women. I've never tried seducing another girl, but if I can get her to lose for me, it should be worth it.)
-3-female_must_strip,target:human,filter:lesbian,notSaidMarker:target1,marker:target1=thinking.png,(Why does ~player~ look at me like that? Does she like girls? If I can make her lose by seducing her I'll be one step closer to the prize.)
-3-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=serious.png,So you're a clown... I'm sorry, I just haven't had the best experience with <i>clowns</i>.
-3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=calm.png,A pirate woman, huh? That's refreshing considering I'm usually dealing with men.
-3-female_must_strip,target:juri,targetStage:0=serious.png,(This woman is intense. Crazy even. I should avoid talking to her.)
-3-female_must_strip,target:kizuna,targetStage:0=thinking.png,So what does A.I. mean? Additional Interest? Annoying... Individual?
-3-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=thinking.png,I feel like I've seen wings like those on someone. And the pink color...
-3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Who on their right mind bring a gun to a poker game?
-3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:1=serious.png,Are you sick? I'd give you some of Chopper's medicine, but I don't like you very much.
-3-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=sad.png,You really are sick, aren't you? Fine, I'll give you the medicine.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:keeping_camera=shocked.png,(A photographer? What if she's one of those Marines who take pictures for the wanted posters?)
-3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=thinking.png,That's an odd outfit. You look like a giant... strawberry.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Did you say you're Dracula's daughter? You mean Dracule Mihawk, the Shichibukai?
-3-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:1=smiling.png,Mavis, your look reminds me of Thriller Bark, for some reason. But it doesn't make sense, because you look like a nice girl and not like any of the monsters I saw there.
-3-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=smiling.png,With that outfit, you clearly came from a winter island. Mei, right?
-3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=thinking.png,So you're a pirate? This is just a guess, but are you the captain by any chance?
-3-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0=smiling.png,At last a normal, pleasant woman in this place. Nice to meet you, Misato.
-3-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:3=thinking.png,Is something worrying you, Misato? Aside from having to undress...
-3-female_must_strip,target:misty_hgss,targetStage:1=thinking.png,Misty, you look like you'd know. What are these <i>Pokermon</i> I've heard about?
-3-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Why do you talk to ~player~ so casually, Monika? Do you two know each other?
-3-female_must_strip,target:mulan,targetStage:0=thinking.png,(This is a woman disguised as a man, right? The outfit isn't flashy enough to be an Okama, so...)
-3-female_must_strip,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=sad.png,Hey, little girl. You shouldn't be here. Did you get lost on your way to school? Let me help you...
-3-female_must_strip,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=thinking.png,It's true what they say about small people making up for their stature with their personalities...
-3-female_must_strip,target:natsuki,targetStage:6=serious.png,Okay, no point in throwing a tantrum, little lady.
-3-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=thinking.png,I know pretty much anyone is allowed to play this game, but a ball of light? Really?
-3-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:1=thinking.png,Are you part of that Tontatta Tribe from Dressrosa my crew told me about? You look like a fairy, at least.
-3-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You have a very graceful look to you, Nayru. Kinda like what I imagine a goddess would look like.
-3-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:3=thinking.png,Nayru, can I ask you about your ears? Are they part of your native race? I don't think I've ever met anyone with ears like that.
-3-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=shocked.png,What is that thing...? A ghost?!
-3-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Do you work here, ~name~? Is it okay for you to play?
-3-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1=smiling.png,Did I mention how cute that maid outfit is? Not only that, but it's also very sexy.
-3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=smiling.png,A goddess, huh? I've met a god before, but you seem a lot more pleasant.
-3-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:1=thinking.png,So what are your powers as a goddess? Just out of curiosity, you can't summon lighting, can you?
-3-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=thinking.png,A female wrestler, huh? I can understand guys being into stuff like that, the guys in my crew sure are. But a woman?
-3-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:2,targetSayingMarker:cammy_help,alsoPlaying:cammy_white,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=calm.png,Are you sure you wanna help her, Cammy? Mika seems nice and all, but...
-3-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:2,targetSayingMarker:cammy_help,alsoPlaying:cammy_white,alsoPlayingStage:7=calm.png,Are you sure you wanna help her, Cammy? Mika seems nice and all, but...
-3-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=smiling.png,Aren't you trying a little too hard to be scary with that outfit? I mean, it's not like there are real witches or...
-3-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Those wings freak me out. They're scary instead of adorable like the ones in the sky people.
-3-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=shocked.png,(I can tell this woman is bad news. And she's a bounty hunter? I should try to get along with her.)
-3-female_must_strip,target:ribbon_girl,targetStage:0=thinking.png,You can stretch your arms? Just like Luffy.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ribbon_girl,targetStage:2=thinking.png,So, your arms... Did you get them after eating a Devil Fruit?
-3-female_must_strip,target:rin,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:artistunlucky=sad.png,I could understand living with one arm, but without both of them? I'd be completely useless.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Why does that thing in your uniform that looks like an eye keep moving? It's freaking me out more than the sword.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:mako,totalRounds:0=furious.png,Gah! You scared me! I thought there were no more players allowed.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=serious.png,Finally that creepy uniform is coming off. I swear that eye keeps looking at me.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=smiling.png,That sword really looks like half of a pair of scissors. Oh, it's called Scissor Blade? That makes sense, heheh...
-3-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=thinking.png,Smoke? How is that uniform even built? I'm sure Franky would like to take a closer look at it.
-3-female_must_strip,target:saki_zls,targetStage:6=serious.png,Okay, I'll accept you even if you're a zombie as long as you don't try to eat me.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sakura,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You're an idol, right? Are you looking for a manager? I'm sure I'd do a great job!
-3-female_must_strip,target:sakura,targetStage:3=smiling.png,Sorry for freaking out earlier, Sakura. Even if you're a zombie, you seem pretty cool.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=thinking.png,White and blue... Is that some kind of weird, experimental Marine uniform?
-3-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=thinking.png,This witch you keep talking about is just a game or something, right? If there was really a witch here, I'd be the first one to run away.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sayori,targetStage:0=calm.png,I like your energy, but... you know you're playing strip poker, right?
-3-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=calm.png,I really feel under dressed next to you. What do you need all the armor and equipment for, anyway?
-3-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=calm.png,An assassin, huh? Robin was an assassin too before she joined the crew, and she seemed a lot scarier than you. So I have no problem with that.
-3-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:4=smug.png,So you're down to your underwear... Huh?
-3-female_must_strip,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Did you say earlier you're a ship? I think you're confused, young lady. I know ships, and even if they're very different, I've never seen one that looks like a person.
-3-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=shocked.png,A GHOST!!! Why didn't I see it earlier?!
-3-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:1=sad.png,If someone had told me that today I'd be playing strip poker with a ghost when I woke up, I'd have laughed.
-3-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:2=serious.png,Why does a ghost wear clothes, anyway? Don't you just usually put a sheet on top of you?
-3-female_must_strip,target:syrenne,targetStage:0=shocked.png,(Just my luck that I'm in the same table as a bounty hunter. At least it's a woman. Worst case scenario, maybe I can reason with her.)
-3-female_must_strip,target:syrenne,targetStage:1=thinking.png,Shouldn't you focus on the game instead of drinking? What are you drinking, anyway?
-3-female_must_strip,target:syrenne,targetStage:5=serious.png,I told you. You're lucky you didn't spill your drink when you were fully clothed.
-3-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=smiling.png,Even for a princess, you're a lot more... colorful than what I'm used to.
-3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Are you a member of Germa 66? I don't think I've every seen anyone else wear an outfit like that.
-3-female_must_strip,target:weiss_schnee,targetStage:0=happy.png,Mmmm, I definitely know how to recognize the richest person in this place. And here she is...
-3-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Is that a skull on your sweater? Are you a pirate?
-3-female_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:target2,test:~human.tag.lesbian~:false,marker:target2=thinking.png,(~Player~ looks naive. I can probably use my persuasion tactics to convince her into losing the game.)
-3-female_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:target2,test:~human.tag.lesbian~:false,marker:target2=thinking.png,(~Player~ seems like the perfect girl to practice my manipulation skills on. If I can get her to lose, it would help me a great deal in this game.)
-3-female_must_strip,target:human,notSaidMarker:target2,test:~human.tag.lesbian~:false,marker:target2=thinking.png,(Who should I try to manipulate into losing the game? Hmmm, ~player~ seems like the perfect victim. She has those lost puppy eyes.)

-2-male_must_strip=custom:smiling,I'm not a sore loser, but it's still a little satisfying to see the guys lose now.
-2-male_must_strip=custom:seductive,What's wrong, ~name~? Did I distract you? Serves you right.
-2-male_must_strip=custom:smug,Watching you lose will never get old now.
-2-male_must_strip,count-role;target&character;ryuji&stage;0-4:=serious.png,(Is this guy a pirate? He seems to act like one. An inoffensive one, at least.)
-2-male_must_strip,count-role;target&character;dust&stage;0:=happy.png,Oh, I didn't notice before you have a tail. You must be a Mink.
-2-male_must_strip,count-role;target&character;n&stage;0:=sad.png,What kind of a name is <i>N</i>? It's gotta be fake. Oh, maybe I should've given a fake name too.
-2-male_must_strip,target:jotaro,targetStage:0=shocked.png,(This guy seems scary. I better don't stand too close to him.)
-2-male_must_strip,target:kamina,targetStage:0=serious.png,Who's this guy? He's like a Franky without the robot parts. I feel like he's gonna scream <i>Suuuper</i> at any moment.

-2-female_must_strip=custom:serious,Hey, remember I had to take off <i>everything</i>. Now it's your turn.
-2-female_must_strip=custom:smug,No complaining, young lady. We all have to suffer in this game.
-2-female_must_strip=custom:thinking,Someone has to lose, ~name~. You should know the game at this point.
-2-female_must_strip=thinking.png,You can ask another player to help you undress? I didn't know that.
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lotte&stage;0:=smiling.png,Are you pretending you're a witch? Aren't you a little too old to play games? Though I guess you're not hurting anyone.
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;jessie&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I don't think I've ever met someone who works in <i>that kind of stuff</i>. But you seem very easy to talk to, Jessie.
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;haru&stage;0-2:=smiling.png,I wonder if that hair is softer than Chopper's fur. Would it be weird if I touch it?
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;2:=thinking.png,I've seen a lot of weird stuff sailing with my crew, but everything can still be explained. That's why I don't believe in magic. Are you sure you didn't eat a Devil Fruit without noticing? It happens.
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;0:=sad.png,Scary looking woman... (She reminds me a little of Robin when I first met her.)

-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;erufuda:=smiling.png,From what I see, you like fries <i>a lot</i>.
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;estelle&stage;0:=smiling.png,That's a fancy outfit you have. Are you rich? Perhaps... a princess?
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;mythra&stage;0:=thinking.png,That's a very elaborate... dress? Armor? Hmm, it's a little revealing to be armor.
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;jolyne&stage;0:=smiling.png,That's a very unique look you have, Jolyne. If you were a wanted criminal, you'd be very easy to find, hahah...
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;0:=smiling.png,That's an adorable witch outfit. This isn't a costume party, though.
-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;0:=smiling.png,This is just a wild guess, but you like the color pink, don't you?

-2-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;1:=calm.png,Why do you keep talking about magic, ~name~? Magic isn't real.
-2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:fighter,oneShotId:118=smug.png,A fighter, huh? I'm sure you're no match for Luffy.
-2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:fighter,oneShotId:118=annoyed.png,So you're a fighter. It's a good thing my crew mates are not here, or some of them would be eager to get into a fight with her for no reason.
-2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:ginger,oneShotId:236,priority:200=smiling.png,Nice hair, ~name~. Heheh...
-2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:ginger,oneShotId:236,priority:200=smiling.png,I really like your hair, ~name~. I don't know why.
-2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:non-human,oneShotId:117,priority:240=thinking.png,What a weird creature... Good thing Luffy isn't here, or he would ask her to join the crew.
-2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:non-human,oneShotId:117,priority:240=thinking.png,What is <i>that</i>? The sea really is a vast place...
-2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:princess,oneShotId:116=smiling.png,You're a princess? You wouldn't happen to know Vivi, right? She's the princess of the Kingdom of Alabasta. I haven't talked to her in a while.
-2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:princess,oneShotId:116=smiling.png,You're a princess, right? I've met a few, I know what they look like.
-2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:princess,oneShotId:116=greedy.png,Oh, a princess! I bet your kingdom is rich and powerful. Those clothes you're wearing look expensive...
-2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:scantily-clad,oneShotId:115,priority:220=happy.png,And people say that I dress inappropriately. That's still a cute outfit, though...
-2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:scantily-clad,oneShotId:115,priority:220=happy.png,I don't see anything indecent about that outfit, but I also don't consider my own look inappropriate and people are always bugging me about me. What do you think, ~player~?
-2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:school_uniform,oneShotId:114=serious.png,You... look a little young to be here. If you're as young as you look, you should leave now.
-2-female_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:school_uniform,oneShotId:114=serious.png,Doesn't that uniform mean you're still in school? Then what do you think you're doing here?
-2-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:0=serious.png,What kind of attire is that? (She barely looks human.)
-2-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5=serious.png,What are you waiting for? You don't have any more clothes, do you?
-2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You look like you come from a different civilization... or you have a very interesting sense of fashion. Either way, I like your outfit.
-2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=annoyed.png,You were already naked before you grew those flowers. I don't like cheaters; but if you're going to do it, at least try to be subtle.
-2-female_must_strip,target:cammy_white,targetStage:0=thinking.png,That's a nice leotard you're wearing... if a little tight, maybe.
-2-female_must_strip,target:cammy_white,targetStage:3=smug.png,You're taking off your leotard now? Now we'll see just how tight it really is.
-2-female_must_strip,target:cammy_white,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:chunli_help,alsoPlaying:chun-li,alsoPlayingStage:0-8=thinking.png,You can ask another player to help you undress? I didn't know that.

-2-female_must_strip,target:caulifla,targetStage:0=thinking.png,That's some crazy hair you have. Did you eat a Devil Fruit that lets you transform into a hedgehog or something?
-2-female_must_strip,target:caulifla,targetStage:1=serious.png,What are you doing? (Doesn't she know she has to strip now?)
-2-female_must_strip,target:caulifla,targetStage:2=smug.png,You think you're so strong because you can turn your hair yellow? I'm sure my crew mates are stronger than you.
-2-female_must_strip,target:caulifla,targetStage:4=smiling.png,Going back to black? Did you get tired of being blonde?
-2-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You are a fighter, huh? Do you fight using kicks? (Those legs...)
-2-female_must_strip,target:elizabeth,targetStage:0=calm.png,Are you a princess, Elizabeth? You're so well mannered and properly dressed that I'd find it hard to believe you're not from a wealthy family.
-2-female_must_strip,target:emi,targetStage:0-1,targetSaidMarker:800m,targetSayingMarker:800m2=smug.png,You're very confident about your running skills, huh? But this is poker, so...
-2-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0=sad.png,You look way too shy to play a game like this? Nobody is forcing you to play, right? Because if that's the case...
-2-female_must_strip,target:futaba,targetStage:0=smiling.png,So you're a navigator too, huh? And we have similar hair? Maybe you're my lost little sister or something, hahah...
-2-female_must_strip,target:hanako,targetStage:0=calm.png,Playing this game to overcome your shyness is a bold move. I suppose that means you're already making progress.
-2-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=serious.png,So you're a clown... I'm sorry, I just haven't had the best experience with <i>clowns</i>.
-2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=calm.png,A pirate woman, huh? That's refreshing considering I'm usually dealing with men.
-2-female_must_strip,target:juri,targetStage:0=serious.png,(This woman is intense. Crazy even. I should avoid talking to her.)
-2-female_must_strip,target:kizuna,targetStage:0=thinking.png,So what does A.I. mean? Additional Interest? Annoying... Individual?
-2-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=thinking.png,I feel like I've seen wings like those on someone. And the pink color...
-2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Who on their right mind bring a gun to a poker game?
-2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:1=serious.png,Are you sick? I'd give you some of Chopper's medicine, but I don't like you very much.
-2-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=sad.png,You really are sick, aren't you? Fine, I'll give you the medicine.
-2-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:keeping_camera=shocked.png,(A photographer? What if she's one of those Marines who take pictures for the wanted posters?)
-2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=thinking.png,That's an odd outfit. You look like a giant... strawberry.
-2-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Did you say you're Dracula's daughter? You mean Dracule Mihawk, the Shichibukai?
-2-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:1=smiling.png,Mavis, your look reminds me of Thriller Bark, for some reason. But it doesn't make sense, because you look like a nice girl and not like any of the monsters I saw there.
-2-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=smiling.png,With that outfit, you clearly came from a winter island. Mei, right?
-2-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=thinking.png,So you're a pirate? This is just a guess, but are you the captain by any chance?
-2-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0=smiling.png,At last a normal, pleasant woman in this place. Nice to meet you, Misato.
-2-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:3=thinking.png,Is something worrying you, Misato? Aside from having to undress...
-2-female_must_strip,target:misty_hgss,targetStage:1=thinking.png,Misty, you look like you'd know. What are these <i>Pokermon</i> I've heard about?
-2-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Why do you talk to ~player~ so casually, Monika? Do you two know each other?
-2-female_must_strip,target:mulan,targetStage:0=thinking.png,(This is a woman disguised as a man, right? The outfit isn't flashy enough to be an Okama, so...)
-2-female_must_strip,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=sad.png,Hey, little girl. You shouldn't be here. Did you get lost on your way to school? Let me help you...
-2-female_must_strip,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=thinking.png,It's true what they say about small people making up for their stature with their personalities...
-2-female_must_strip,target:natsuki,targetStage:6=serious.png,Okay, no point in throwing a tantrum, little lady.
-2-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=thinking.png,I know pretty much anyone is allowed to play this game, but a ball of light? Really?
-2-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:1=thinking.png,Are you part of that Tontatta Tribe from Dressrosa my crew told me about? You look like a fairy, at least.
-2-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You have a very graceful look to you, Nayru. Kinda like what I imagine a goddess would look like.
-2-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:3=thinking.png,Nayru, can I ask you about your ears? Are they part of your native race? I don't think I've ever met anyone with ears like that.
-2-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=shocked.png,What is that thing...? A ghost?!
-2-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Do you work here, ~name~? Is it okay for you to play?
-2-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1=smiling.png,Did I mention how cute that maid outfit is? Not only that, but it's also very sexy.
-2-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=smiling.png,A goddess, huh? I've met a god before, but you seem a lot more pleasant.
-2-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:1=thinking.png,So what are your powers as a goddess? Just out of curiosity, you can't summon lighting, can you?
-2-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=thinking.png,A female wrestler, huh? I can understand guys being into stuff like that, the guys in my crew sure are. But a woman?
-2-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:2,targetSayingMarker:cammy_help,alsoPlaying:cammy_white,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=calm.png,Are you sure you wanna help her, Cammy? Mika seems nice and all, but...
-2-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:2,targetSayingMarker:cammy_help,alsoPlaying:cammy_white,alsoPlayingStage:7=calm.png,Are you sure you wanna help her, Cammy? Mika seems nice and all, but...
-2-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=smiling.png,Aren't you trying a little too hard to be scary with that outfit? I mean, it's not like there are real witches or...
-2-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Those wings freak me out. They're scary instead of adorable like the ones in the sky people.
-2-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=shocked.png,(I can tell this woman is bad news. And she's a bounty hunter? I should try to get along with her.)
-2-female_must_strip,target:ribbon_girl,targetStage:0=thinking.png,You can stretch your arms? Just like Luffy.
-2-female_must_strip,target:ribbon_girl,targetStage:2=thinking.png,So, your arms... Did you get them after eating a Devil Fruit?
-2-female_must_strip,target:rin,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:artistunlucky=sad.png,I could understand living with one arm, but without both of them? I'd be completely useless.
-2-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Why does that thing in your uniform that looks like an eye keep moving? It's freaking me out more than the sword.
-2-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:mako,totalRounds:0=furious.png,Gah! You scared me! I thought there were no more players allowed.
-2-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=serious.png,Finally that creepy uniform is coming off. I swear that eye keeps looking at me.
-2-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=smiling.png,That sword really looks like half of a pair of scissors. Oh, it's called Scissor Blade? That makes sense, heheh...
-2-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=thinking.png,Smoke? How is that uniform even built? I'm sure Franky would like to take a closer look at it.
-2-female_must_strip,target:saki_zls,targetStage:6=serious.png,Okay, I'll accept you even if you're a zombie as long as you don't try to eat me.
-2-female_must_strip,target:sakura,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You're an idol, right? Are you looking for a manager? I'm sure I'd do a great job!
-2-female_must_strip,target:sakura,targetStage:3=smiling.png,Sorry for freaking out earlier, Sakura. Even if you're a zombie, you seem pretty cool.
-2-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=thinking.png,White and blue... Is that some kind of weird, experimental Marine uniform?
-2-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=thinking.png,This witch you keep talking about is just a game or something, right? If there was really a witch here, I'd be the first one to run away.
-2-female_must_strip,target:sayori,targetStage:0=calm.png,I like your energy, but... you know you're playing strip poker, right?
-2-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=calm.png,I really feel under dressed next to you. What do you need all the armor and equipment for, anyway?
-2-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=calm.png,An assassin, huh? Robin was an assassin too before she joined the crew, and she seemed a lot scarier than you. So I have no problem with that.
-2-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:4=smug.png,So you're down to your underwear... Huh?
-2-female_must_strip,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Did you say earlier you're a ship? I think you're confused, young lady. I know ships, and even if they're very different, I've never seen one that looks like a person.
-2-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=shocked.png,A GHOST!!! Why didn't I see it earlier?!
-2-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:1=sad.png,If someone had told me that today I'd be playing strip poker with a ghost when I woke up, I'd have laughed.
-2-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:2=serious.png,Why does a ghost wear clothes, anyway? Don't you just usually put a sheet on top of you?
-2-female_must_strip,target:syrenne,targetStage:0=shocked.png,(Just my luck that I'm in the same table as a bounty hunter. At least it's a woman. Worst case scenario, maybe I can reason with her.)
-2-female_must_strip,target:syrenne,targetStage:1=thinking.png,Shouldn't you focus on the game instead of drinking? What are you drinking, anyway?
-2-female_must_strip,target:syrenne,targetStage:5=serious.png,I told you. You're lucky you didn't spill your drink when you were fully clothed.
-2-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=smiling.png,Even for a princess, you're a lot more... colorful than what I'm used to.
-2-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Are you a member of Germa 66? I don't think I've every seen anyone else wear an outfit like that.
-2-female_must_strip,target:weiss_schnee,targetStage:0=happy.png,Mmmm, I definitely know how to recognize the richest person in this place. And here she is...
-2-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Is that a skull on your sweater? Are you a pirate?


#finished
-1-male_must_strip=smug.png,If you don't mind, I'm going to spend the rest of my time here watching you lose over and over again, ~name~.
-1-male_must_strip=greedy.png,I only lost because of bad luck earlier. I could give you poker lessons later, if you want, ~name~. But I warn you, they're not cheap.
-1-male_must_strip=calm.png,Look who lost! My favorite player. I'm just kidding, you're not my favorite.
-1-male_must_strip=smug.png,Time to strip, buddy. No point in postponing it any longer.
-1-male_must_strip,count-role;target&character;ryuji&stage;0-4:=serious.png,(Is this guy a pirate? He seems to act like one. An inoffensive one, at least.)
-1-male_must_strip,count-role;target&character;dust&stage;0:=happy.png,Oh, I didn't notice before you have a tail. You must be a Mink.
-1-male_must_strip,count-role;target&character;n&stage;0:=sad.png,What kind of a name is <i>N</i>? It's gotta be fake. Oh, maybe I should've given a fake name too.
-1-male_must_strip,target:jotaro,targetStage:0=shocked.png,(This guy seems scary. I better don't stand too close to him.)
-1-male_must_strip,target:kamina,targetStage:0=serious.png,Who's this guy? He's like a Franky without the robot parts. I feel like he's gonna scream <i>Suuuper</i> at any moment.
-1-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You're an Skypiean, right? Heso! Did you come down to the surface just to play this game?
-1-female_must_strip=calm.png,Are you sure you wanna help her, Cammy? Mika seems nice and all, but...
-1-female_must_strip=smiling.png,Oh, right! You're still playing the game. But for how much longer? I wonder...
-1-female_must_strip=smug.png,Loser! I guess I'm a bigger loser since I lost way earlier. But still, hahah!
-1-female_must_strip=smiling.png,My favorite part of losing the game, is making fun of the ones that are still playing.
-1-female_must_strip=happy.png,Oh, man! The game is still going strong after I lost.
-1-female_must_strip=thinking.png,You can ask another player to help you undress? I didn't know that.
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;lotte&stage;0:=smiling.png,Are you pretending you're a witch? Aren't you a little too old to play games? Though I guess you're not hurting anyone.
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;jessie&stage;0:=embarrassed.png,I don't think I've ever met someone who works in <i>that kind of stuff</i>. But you seem very easy to talk to, Jessie.
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;haru&stage;0-2:=smiling.png,I wonder if that hair is softer than Chopper's fur. Would it be weird if I touch it?
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;2:=thinking.png,I've seen a lot of weird stuff sailing with my crew, but everything can still be explained. That's why I don't believe in magic. Are you sure you didn't eat a Devil Fruit without noticing? It happens.
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;0:=sad.png,Scary looking woman... (She reminds me a little of Robin when I first met her.)
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;erufuda:=smiling.png,So you like fries, huh? I can... see that.
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;erufuda:=smiling.png,From what I see, you like fries <i>a lot</i>.
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;estelle&stage;0:=smiling.png,That's a fancy outfit you have. Are you rich? Perhaps... a princess?
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;mythra&stage;0:=thinking.png,That's a very elaborate... dress? Armor? Hmm, it's a little revealing to be armor.
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;jolyne&stage;0:=smiling.png,That's a very unique look you have, Jolyne. If you were a wanted criminal, you'd be very easy to find, hahah...
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;0:=smiling.png,That's an adorable witch outfit. This isn't a costume party, though.
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&stage;0:=smiling.png,This is just a wild guess, but you like the color pink, don't you?
-1-female_must_strip,count-role;target&character;haru&stage;5&sayingmarker;seductingplayer:=sad.png,Where did the sweet, gentle Haru go?

-1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=calm.png,A pirate woman, huh? That's refreshing considering I'm usually dealing with men.
-1-female_must_strip,target:juri,targetStage:0=serious.png,(This woman is intense. Crazy even. I should avoid talking to her.)
-1-female_must_strip,target:kizuna,targetStage:0=thinking.png,So what does A.I. mean? Additional Interest? Annoying... Individual?
-1-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=thinking.png,I feel like I've seen wings like those on someone. And the pink color...
-1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Who on their right mind bring a gun to a poker game?
-1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:1=serious.png,Are you sick? I'd give you some of Chopper's medicine, but I don't like you very much.
-1-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:5=sad.png,You really are sick, aren't you? Fine, I'll give you the medicine.
-1-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:keeping_camera=shocked.png,(A photographer? What if she's one of those Marines who take pictures for the wanted posters?)
-1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=thinking.png,That's an odd outfit. You look like a giant... strawberry.
-1-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Did you say you're Dracula's daughter? You mean Dracule Mihawk, the Shichibukai?
-1-female_must_strip,target:mavis,targetStage:1=smiling.png,Mavis, your look reminds me of Thriller Bark, for some reason. But it doesn't make sense, because you look like a nice girl and not like any of the monsters I saw there.
-1-female_must_strip,target:mei,targetStage:0=smiling.png,With that outfit, you clearly came from a winter island. Mei, right?
-1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=thinking.png,So you're a pirate? This is just a guess, but are you the captain by any chance?
-1-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:0=smiling.png,At last a normal, pleasant woman in this place. Nice to meet you, Misato.
-1-female_must_strip,target:misato,targetStage:3=thinking.png,Is something worrying you, Misato? Aside from having to undress...
-1-female_must_strip,target:misty_hgss,targetStage:1=thinking.png,Misty, you look like you'd know. What are these <i>Pokermon</i> I've heard about?
-1-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Why do you talk to ~player~ so casually, Monika? Do you two know each other?
-1-female_must_strip,target:mulan,targetStage:0=thinking.png,(This is a woman disguised as a man, right? The outfit isn't flashy enough to be an Okama, so...)
-1-female_must_strip,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=sad.png,Hey, little girl. You shouldn't be here. Did you get lost on your way to school? Let me help you...
-1-female_must_strip,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=thinking.png,It's true what they say about small people making up for their stature with their personalities...
-1-female_must_strip,target:natsuki,targetStage:6=serious.png,Okay, no point in throwing a tantrum, little lady.
-1-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=thinking.png,I know pretty much anyone is allowed to play this game, but a ball of light? Really?
-1-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:1=thinking.png,Are you part of that Tontatta Tribe from Dressrosa my crew told me about? You look like a fairy, at least.
-1-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You have a very graceful look to you, Nayru. Kinda like what I imagine a goddess would look like.
-1-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:3=thinking.png,Nayru, can I ask you about your ears? Are they part of your native race? I don't think I've ever met anyone with ears like that.
-1-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=shocked.png,What is that thing...? A ghost?!
-1-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Do you work here, ~name~? Is it okay for you to play?
-1-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1=smiling.png,Did I mention how cute that maid outfit is? Not only that, but it's also very sexy.
-1-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=smiling.png,A goddess, huh? I've met a god before, but you seem a lot more pleasant.
-1-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:1=thinking.png,So what are your powers as a goddess? Just out of curiosity, you can't summon lighting, can you?
-1-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=thinking.png,A female wrestler, huh? I can understand guys being into stuff like that, the guys in my crew sure are. But a woman?
-1-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:2,targetSayingMarker:cammy_help,alsoPlaying:cammy_white,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=calm.png,Are you sure you wanna help her, Cammy? Mika seems nice and all, but...
-1-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:2,targetSayingMarker:cammy_help,alsoPlaying:cammy_white,alsoPlayingStage:7=calm.png,Are you sure you wanna help her, Cammy? Mika seems nice and all, but...
-1-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=smiling.png,Aren't you trying a little too hard to be scary with that outfit? I mean, it's not like there are real witches or...
-1-female_must_strip,target:remilia,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Those wings freak me out. They're scary instead of adorable like the ones in the sky people.
-1-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=shocked.png,(I can tell this woman is bad news. And she's a bounty hunter? I should try to get along with her.)
-1-female_must_strip,target:ribbon_girl,targetStage:0=thinking.png,You can stretch your arms? Just like Luffy.
-1-female_must_strip,target:ribbon_girl,targetStage:2=thinking.png,So, your arms... Did you get them after eating a Devil Fruit?
-1-female_must_strip,target:rin,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:artistunlucky=sad.png,I could understand living with one arm, but without both of them? I'd be completely useless.
-1-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Why does that thing in your uniform that looks like an eye keep moving? It's freaking me out more than the sword.
-1-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,targetSayingMarker:mako,totalRounds:0=furious.png,Gah! You scared me! I thought there were no more players allowed.
-1-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=serious.png,Finally that creepy uniform is coming off. I swear that eye keeps looking at me.
-1-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=smiling.png,That sword really looks like half of a pair of scissors. Oh, it's called Scissor Blade? That makes sense, heheh...
-1-female_must_strip,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=thinking.png,Smoke? How is that uniform even built? I'm sure Franky would like to take a closer look at it.
-1-female_must_strip,target:saki_zls,targetStage:6=serious.png,Okay, I'll accept you even if you're a zombie as long as you don't try to eat me.
-1-female_must_strip,target:sakura,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You're an idol, right? Are you looking for a manager? I'm sure I'd do a great job!
-1-female_must_strip,target:sakura,targetStage:3=smiling.png,Sorry for freaking out earlier, Sakura. Even if you're a zombie, you seem pretty cool.
-1-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=thinking.png,White and blue... Is that some kind of weird, experimental Marine uniform?
-1-female_must_strip,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=thinking.png,This witch you keep talking about is just a game or something, right? If there was really a witch here, I'd be the first one to run away.
-1-female_must_strip,target:sayori,targetStage:0=calm.png,I like your energy, but... you know you're playing strip poker, right?
-1-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=calm.png,I really feel under dressed next to you. What do you need all the armor and equipment for, anyway?
-1-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:0=calm.png,An assassin, huh? Robin was an assassin too before she joined the crew, and she seemed a lot scarier than you. So I have no problem with that.
-1-female_must_strip,target:sheena,targetStage:4=smug.png,So you're down to your underwear... Huh?
-1-female_must_strip,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Did you say earlier you're a ship? I think you're confused, young lady. I know ships, and even if they're very different, I've never seen one that looks like a person.
-1-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=shocked.png,A GHOST!!! Why didn't I see it earlier?!
-1-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:1=sad.png,If someone had told me that today I'd be playing strip poker with a ghost when I woke up, I'd have laughed.
-1-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:2=serious.png,Why does a ghost wear clothes, anyway? Don't you just usually put a sheet on top of you?
-1-female_must_strip,target:syrenne,targetStage:0=shocked.png,(Just my luck that I'm in the same table as a bounty hunter. At least it's a woman. Worst case scenario, maybe I can reason with her.)
-1-female_must_strip,target:syrenne,targetStage:1=thinking.png,Shouldn't you focus on the game instead of drinking? What are you drinking, anyway?
-1-female_must_strip,target:syrenne,targetStage:5=serious.png,I told you. You're lucky you didn't spill your drink when you were fully clothed.
-1-female_must_strip,target:twilight,targetStage:0=smiling.png,Even for a princess, you're a lot more... colorful than what I'm used to.
-1-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Are you a member of Germa 66? I don't think I've every seen anyone else wear an outfit like that.
-1-female_must_strip,target:weiss_schnee,targetStage:0=happy.png,Mmmm, I definitely know how to recognize the richest person in this place. And here she is...
-1-female_must_strip,target:zone-tan,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Is that a skull on your sweater? Are you a pirate?




#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

#fully clothed
0-male_removing_accessory=annoyed.png,Is that all? Are you sure?
0-male_removing_accessory=annoyed.png,I knew you were going to count your measly ~clothing~.
0-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;n&stage;1&sayingmarker;sponge:=smiling.png,A puzzle, huh? If I solve it, can I keep whatever is inside?
0-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jotaro&stage;0:=calm.png,Huh?
0-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;n&stage;2:=thinking.png,You sure have a lot of weird artifacts. I have a friend who'd probably like to examine them.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=sad.png,(How is he doing this?)
0-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Yep, exactly like Franky.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Hmmm, now that I look at them, those wings are much bigger than the ones the Skypieans had. Are you from a different sky island?
0-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=greedy.png,That sash looks valuable! Mmmm, I miss that beautiful sky gold...
0-male_removed_accessory=smiling.png,Well, as long as I haven't lost a round yet...
0-male_removed_accessory=serious.png,It's no big deal, I guess. But if things go south for me later, I'll remember this, ~name~,
0-male_removed_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;n&stage;2&saidmarker;sponge&sayingmarker;sponge_explain:=serious.png,I think I understood like 50% of that... Okay, more like 20%.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=sad.png,Your belts disappeared. Is that an ability? But how...?
0-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=thinking.png,(Is he stopping time or something? No, that would be too farfetched and terrifying for a Devil Fruit ability.)
0-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:1=sad.png,And I thought I'd have a chance to relax in this game without dealing with weird individuals.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=smiling.png,Wow, a sky archipelago! I'd love to see it one day, but there's no way I'm going to the White Sea through the Knock Up Stream again.
0-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=smiling.png,Don't worry, I have no intention of stealing it. No matter how expensive it looks.
0-female_removing_accessory=calm.png,I see you came prepared to lose a few rounds, ~name~. Smart.
0-female_removing_accessory=smiling.png,Hey, I bet you wore that just in case you lost a few rounds, you clever girl.
0-female_removing_accessory=thinking.png,Did everyone come overly accessorized in preparation for losing?
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sola&stage;0:,id:73=smug.png,Just the ribbon? Come on, you can do better than that.
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;1:,id:76=smiling.png,So that's where all those fries are going...
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;0:=shocked.png,What the...? Your outfit...
0-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;lotte&stage;0:=calm.png,You have a toy wand and all. That's kind of adorable.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:rin,targetStage:1,count-emi:0=serious.png,What are you waiting for, ~player~? Help her.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5,id:18=shocked.png,AHHHH!!! What is that on your back?!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:0=greedy.png,That bag doesn't look expensive, but...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy_white,targetStage:0=serious.png,It is tight. And if I may say it, it's riding a little high on the back.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:caulifla,targetStage:0=shocked.png,So that's your natural hair? Sorry, I didn't mean to imply it's weird, or anything. It's actually very normal and... pointy.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Oh, I have a friend who fights using kicks. (Look at those legs...)
0-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3=thinking.png,That choker... It doesn't look very valuable. Does it have some special meaning to you?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=thinking.png,Eh? Where did she go?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=thinking.png,I just need to make sure, but you have nothing to do with Buggy the clown, do you?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=smiling.png,You really are quite beautiful, Jura. And that dress...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=serious.png,Wow. You look innocent and cute, but you're actually a pervert, aren't you?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=shocked.png,Eh? What happened to you?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:leggy,targetStage:0=calm.png,Not a Mink, huh? Then are you a Devil Fruit user...?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=smiling.png,Are you really gonna keep your camera? Why? Y-you're not gonna use it, right? Heheh...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=serious.png,Oh, a ladybug! That's makes more sense. Wait, is that a yo-yo? I'm more confused now.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:1=thinking.png,So... how come you can fly? Devil Fruit? Science? Some sort of illusion?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You clearly don't look like a conventional pirate, but you still have a sort of eye patch, heheh.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:0=calm.png,Nice beret. Maybe I should get myself one. Oh, but is it part of your uniform?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:0=smiling.png,Yeah, very manly...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:mythra,targetStage:0=greedy.png,Those aren't emeralds, are they? There's so many...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Oh, sorry! You just seem a lot younger at first glance.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=smiling.png,I didn't mean to imply I have a problem with that. I just don't want to you get in trouble with your boss.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=thinking.png,So do you live on a Sky Island? Is it on the Grand Line?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:2=greedy.png,(She's wearing all these expensive looking accessories... But she's a goddess... But they look so valuable...)
0-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0=sad.png,This is why you brought your butler? Talk about spoiled...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=smiling.png,H-hey, nice tattoo you have there, sister. I have one too, see? On my left shoulder?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=smiling.png,So... two guns, huh? Is one not enough?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:ribbon_girl,targetStage:0=calm.png,Oh, Luffy is my captain. He can also stretch his arms, since he's pretty much made of rubber.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=serious.png,Why is she on the floor taking off your shoes? I thought she was your friend, but she's acting more like an slave.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=shocked.png,Mako!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=shocked.png,You don't have any grenades in there, right? What if one goes off?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=shocked.png,FIRE! Let me use my Clima-Tact to extinguish it!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=shocked.png,Hey, that's your head!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=sad.png,It doesn't look like one of the ghost of that girl from Thriller Bark, but it has a knife...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=thinking.png,This thing you call <i>Quirk</i> is your Devil Fruit ability, right? It must be a cultural difference, like how in Wano they call them sorcery.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss_schnee,targetStage:0=greedy.png,Ohhh, <i>very</i> rich! That necklace looks expensive...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss_schnee,targetStage:4=furious.png,Your hairpins? But you're in your underwear! And...
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStatus:exposed=serious.png,Why didn't you take this off before showing your other parts? I don't understand.
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStatus:exposed=serious.png,Alright. You clearly don't care about what to show first.
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStatus:naked=thinking.png,If only you'd had this when you still weren't naked. Oh, wait, you did. Then...
0-female_removing_accessory,targetStatus:naked=serious.png,Really? But why did you had to be naked before you removed your ~clothing~? You're weird.
0-female_removed_accessory=smug.png,But let's see if you can hold on to your accessories after losing over and over.
0-female_removed_accessory=smug.png,Just keep in mind that if you lose more and more, that won't make a difference.
0-female_removed_accessory=smug.png,I have a few accessories too, in case I lose once or twice. Looks like we had the same idea.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lotte&stage;1:=smiling.png,I mean... what a nice wand! You must be able to do all kinds of magic with that! (She seems like a nice girl, I'll just play along with her fantasy.)
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sola&stage;1:,id:74=smiling.png,Oh, you're actually removing something else too. I honestly didn't think you would.
0-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;1:=thinking.png,That's a Devil Fruit ability, right? Transforming clothes... It's kinda like Kin'emon's.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6=shocked.png,So you are a Devil Fruit user? A snake woman, or something?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:1=thinking.png,How expensive would you say it is, exactly?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy_white,targetStage:1=furious.png,Fine! You know what? Your leotard is skimpy, and your ass is completely exposed. Happy?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=calm.png,If I did, would my legs become as... strong as yours?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:4=smiling.png,Sentimental value is not something you can understand unless you feel it. I would never steal something that important to another person.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=furious.png,You tried to run away?! That does it, I won't feel sorry for you anymore.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=serious.png,His red nose is real, can you believe that?. What a freak... I'm happy Luffy kicked his ass.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=embarrassed.png,W-well, we cute pirate girls usually get a lot of attention. I just thought you might relate to that.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=sad.png,I don't know that many perverted woman, and it's a little baffling to meet one that looks like she jumped out of a children's book.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=furious.png,Don't shoot right next to me, you crazy woman!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=furious.png,Hey! Don't just drop that, it's a loaded gun!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:leggy,targetStage:1=thinking.png,Not a Devil Fruit user either? Then... what are you?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=sad.png,I have nothing personal against your look, but I don't like bugs very much.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=thinking.png,Fair enough. I guess there isn't such a thing as a <i>conventional pirate</i>. Still, there's something different about you.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=thinking.png,Where do you work, Misato? That's a cute uniform.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:1,targetSaying:delete=serious.png,Delete what? Your shoes? What are you talking about?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:1=sad.png,(I don't know why she's disguised herself, so I'm not gonna try to blow her cover.)
0-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=sad.png,It was just a misunderstanding. I didn't mean to comment on your small size...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=smiling.png,I, uhh,  have a question, Palutena. As a goddess, how would you punish a human for stealing?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1=serious.png,You have hands, don't you? You don't need someone else to undress you just because you're rich.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=sad.png,Y-your tattoo is better than mine. I wasn't trying to compare mine with yours.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=thinking.png,W-well, one of my crew mates uses three swords, which is a lot weirder. So...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:ribbon_girl,targetStage:1=sad.png,Well, not only his arms. He can stretch <i>anywhere</i>. Wow, that sounded kinda dirty...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:rin,targetStage:2=thinking.png,So your school still makes you wear a tie even though you can't take it off by yourself? That doesn't make sense.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=sad.png,Stripping together, huh? That's some friendship.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=sad.png,She's fine? That really scared me, I thought you hit her with the sword for a second.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=serious.png,You don't have any other weapons hidden, right? I mean, if you're going to be drinking...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=sad.png,What? You did that on purpose? Didn't you receive any burns?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=serious.png,You're not very bright, are you? Kinda like a female Luffy...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1=shocked.png,Ghosts without knives are still scary...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=calm.png,I've met Devil Fruit users who can float before. Could it be your outfit that allows you to fly and you're just pretending it's you who's doing it?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:weiss_schnee,targetStage:1=smiling.png,Are you looking for new friends, Weiss? Me too! You can call me Big Sister Nami.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:weiss_schnee,targetStage:5=greedy.png,Well, if they're expensive hairpins, I guess I can forgive you. Your hair looks great, by the way!


#lost belt
1-male_removing_accessory=smug.png,Alright. If that's how you wanna play, I'll rise up to the challenge.
1-male_removing_accessory=serious.png,Oh, so that's how it's gonna be, huh? Fine.
1-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;n&stage;1&sayingmarker;sponge:=smiling.png,A puzzle, huh? If I solve it, can I keep whatever is inside?
1-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jotaro&stage;0:=calm.png,Huh?
1-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;n&stage;2:=thinking.png,You sure have a lot of weird artifacts. I have a friend who'd probably like to examine them.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=sad.png,(How is he doing this?)
1-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Yep, exactly like Franky.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Hmmm, now that I look at them, those wings are much bigger than the ones the Skypieans had. Are you from a different sky island?
1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=greedy.png,That sash looks valuable! Mmmm, I miss that beautiful sky gold...
1-male_removed_accessory=calm.png,Next time I lose, I'm taking off my bracelet. Let's see if you like that.
1-male_removed_accessory=calm.png,If I lose another round, I'll take off my bracelet. It's only fair, after all.
1-male_removed_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;n&stage;2&saidmarker;sponge&sayingmarker;sponge_explain:=serious.png,I think I understood like 50% of that... Okay, more like 20%.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=sad.png,Your belts disappeared. Is that an ability? But how...?
1-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=thinking.png,(Is he stopping time or something? No, that would be too farfetched and terrifying for a Devil Fruit ability.)
1-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:1=sad.png,And I thought I'd have a chance to relax in this game without dealing with weird individuals.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=smiling.png,Wow, a sky archipelago! I'd love to see it one day, but there's no way I'm going to the White Sea through the Knock Up Stream again.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=smiling.png,Don't worry, I have no intention of stealing it. No matter how expensive it looks.
1-female_removing_accessory=calm.png,Your ~clothing~? You do what you can, sister.
1-female_removing_accessory=smiling.png,Oh, your ~clothing~. I see, I see...
1-female_removing_accessory=smug.png,I bet you're going to remove your... ~clothing~! Ah, see? I was right.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sola&stage;0:,id:73=smug.png,Just the ribbon? Come on, you can do better than that.
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;1:,id:76=smiling.png,So that's where all those fries are going...
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;0:=shocked.png,What the...? Your outfit...
1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;lotte&stage;0:=calm.png,You have a toy wand and all. That's kind of adorable.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rin,targetStage:1,count-emi:0=serious.png,What are you waiting for, ~player~? Help her.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5,id:18=shocked.png,AHHHH!!! What is that on your back?!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:0=greedy.png,That bag doesn't look expensive, but...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy_white,targetStage:0=serious.png,It is tight. And if I may say it, it's riding a little high on the back.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:caulifla,targetStage:0=shocked.png,So that's your natural hair? Sorry, I didn't mean to imply it's weird, or anything. It's actually very normal and... pointy.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Oh, I have a friend who fights using kicks. (Look at those legs...)
1-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3=thinking.png,That choker... It doesn't look very valuable. Does it have some special meaning to you?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=thinking.png,Eh? Where did she go?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=thinking.png,I just need to make sure, but you have nothing to do with Buggy the clown, do you?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=smiling.png,You really are quite beautiful, Jura. And that dress...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=serious.png,Wow. You look innocent and cute, but you're actually a pervert, aren't you?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=shocked.png,Eh? What happened to you?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:leggy,targetStage:0=calm.png,Not a Mink, huh? Then are you a Devil Fruit user...?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=smiling.png,Are you really gonna keep your camera? Why? Y-you're not gonna use it, right? Heheh...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=serious.png,Oh, a ladybug! That's makes more sense. Wait, is that a yo-yo? I'm more confused now.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:1=thinking.png,So... how come you can fly? Devil Fruit? Science? Some sort of illusion?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You clearly don't look like a conventional pirate, but you still have a sort of eye patch, heheh.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:0=calm.png,Nice beret. Maybe I should get myself one. Oh, but is it part of your uniform?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:0=smiling.png,Yeah, very manly...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mythra,targetStage:0=greedy.png,Those aren't emeralds, are they? There's so many...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Oh, sorry! You just seem a lot younger at first glance.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=smiling.png,I didn't mean to imply I have a problem with that. I just don't want to you get in trouble with your boss.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=thinking.png,So do you live on a Sky Island? Is it on the Grand Line?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:2=greedy.png,(She's wearing all these expensive looking accessories... But she's a goddess... But they look so valuable...)
1-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0=sad.png,This is why you brought your butler? Talk about spoiled...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=smiling.png,H-hey, nice tattoo you have there, sister. I have one too, see? On my left shoulder?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=smiling.png,So... two guns, huh? Is one not enough?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:ribbon_girl,targetStage:0=calm.png,Oh, Luffy is my captain. He can also stretch his arms, since he's pretty much made of rubber.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=serious.png,Why is she on the floor taking off your shoes? I thought she was your friend, but she's acting more like an slave.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=shocked.png,Mako!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=shocked.png,You don't have any grenades in there, right? What if one goes off?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=shocked.png,FIRE! Let me use my Clima-Tact to extinguish it!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=shocked.png,Hey, that's your head!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=sad.png,It doesn't look like one of the ghost of that girl from Thriller Bark, but it has a knife...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=thinking.png,This thing you call <i>Quirk</i> is your Devil Fruit ability, right? It must be a cultural difference, like how in Wano they call them sorcery.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss_schnee,targetStage:0=greedy.png,Ohhh, <i>very</i> rich! That necklace looks expensive...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss_schnee,targetStage:4=furious.png,Your hairpins? But you're in your underwear! And...
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStatus:exposed=serious.png,Why didn't you take this off before showing your other parts? I don't understand.
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStatus:exposed=serious.png,Alright. You clearly don't care about what to show first.
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStatus:naked=thinking.png,If only you'd had this when you still weren't naked. Oh, wait, you did. Then...
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStatus:naked=serious.png,Really? But why did you had to be naked before you removed your ~clothing~? You're weird.
1-female_removed_accessory=smiling.png,I don't blame you for not wanting to strip, but you gotta admit this is a little infuriating for us.
1-female_removed_accessory=thinking.png,You're the kind that enjoys making new enemies, aren't you?
1-female_removed_accessory=smiling.png,Now let's hope this doesn't come back to bite you in the ass. How, you ask? I wonder...
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lotte&stage;1:=smiling.png,I mean... what a nice wand! You must be able to do all kinds of magic with that! (She seems like a nice girl, I'll just play along with her fantasy.)
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sola&stage;1:,id:74=smiling.png,Oh, you're actually removing something else too. I honestly didn't think you would.
1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;1:=thinking.png,That's a Devil Fruit ability, right? Transforming clothes... It's kinda like Kin'emon's.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6=shocked.png,So you are a Devil Fruit user? A snake woman, or something?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:1=thinking.png,How expensive would you say it is, exactly?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy_white,targetStage:1=furious.png,Fine! You know what? Your leotard is skimpy, and your ass is completely exposed. Happy?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=calm.png,If I did, would my legs become as... strong as yours?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:4=smiling.png,Sentimental value is not something you can understand unless you feel it. I would never steal something that important to another person.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=furious.png,You tried to run away?! That does it, I won't feel sorry for you anymore.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=serious.png,His red nose is real, can you believe that?. What a freak... I'm happy Luffy kicked his ass.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=embarrassed.png,W-well, we cute pirate girls usually get a lot of attention. I just thought you might relate to that.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=sad.png,I don't know that many perverted woman, and it's a little baffling to meet one that looks like she jumped out of a children's book.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=furious.png,Don't shoot right next to me, you crazy woman!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=furious.png,Hey! Don't just drop that, it's a loaded gun!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:leggy,targetStage:1=thinking.png,Not a Devil Fruit user either? Then... what are you?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=sad.png,I have nothing personal against your look, but I don't like bugs very much.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=thinking.png,Fair enough. I guess there isn't such a thing as a <i>conventional pirate</i>. Still, there's something different about you.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=thinking.png,Where do you work, Misato? That's a cute uniform.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:1,targetSaying:delete=serious.png,Delete what? Your shoes? What are you talking about?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:1=sad.png,(I don't know why she's disguised herself, so I'm not gonna try to blow her cover.)
1-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=sad.png,It was just a misunderstanding. I didn't mean to comment on your small size...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=smiling.png,I, uhh,  have a question, Palutena. As a goddess, how would you punish a human for stealing?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1=serious.png,You have hands, don't you? You don't need someone else to undress you just because you're rich.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=sad.png,Y-your tattoo is better than mine. I wasn't trying to compare mine with yours.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=thinking.png,W-well, one of my crew mates uses three swords, which is a lot weirder. So...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:ribbon_girl,targetStage:1=sad.png,Well, not only his arms. He can stretch <i>anywhere</i>. Wow, that sounded kinda dirty...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rin,targetStage:2=thinking.png,So your school still makes you wear a tie even though you can't take it off by yourself? That doesn't make sense.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=sad.png,Stripping together, huh? That's some friendship.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=sad.png,She's fine? That really scared me, I thought you hit her with the sword for a second.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=serious.png,You don't have any other weapons hidden, right? I mean, if you're going to be drinking...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=sad.png,What? You did that on purpose? Didn't you receive any burns?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=serious.png,You're not very bright, are you? Kinda like a female Luffy...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1=shocked.png,Ghosts without knives are still scary...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=calm.png,I've met Devil Fruit users who can float before. Could it be your outfit that allows you to fly and you're just pretending it's you who's doing it?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:weiss_schnee,targetStage:1=smiling.png,Are you looking for new friends, Weiss? Me too! You can call me Big Sister Nami.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:weiss_schnee,targetStage:5=greedy.png,Well, if they're expensive hairpins, I guess I can forgive you. Your hair looks great, by the way!


#lost bracelet
2-male_removing_accessory=furious.png,What? Hmph...
2-male_removing_accessory=furious.png,This is annoying. Almost as annoying as Luffy when he's hungry.
2-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;n&stage;1&sayingmarker;sponge:=smiling.png,A puzzle, huh? If I solve it, can I keep whatever is inside?
2-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jotaro&stage;0:=calm.png,Huh?
2-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;n&stage;2:=thinking.png,You sure have a lot of weird artifacts. I have a friend who'd probably like to examine them.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=sad.png,(How is he doing this?)
2-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Yep, exactly like Franky.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Hmmm, now that I look at them, those wings are much bigger than the ones the Skypieans had. Are you from a different sky island?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=greedy.png,That sash looks valuable! Mmmm, I miss that beautiful sky gold...
2-male_removed_accessory=serious.png,Maybe next time you'll remove something bigger and stop wasting our time. Wouldn't <i>that</i> be special?
2-male_removed_accessory=serious.png,You seem to be determined to extend this game as much as you can. What's your deal, ~name~?
2-male_removed_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;n&stage;2&saidmarker;sponge&sayingmarker;sponge_explain:=serious.png,I think I understood like 50% of that... Okay, more like 20%.

2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=smiling.png,Don't worry, I have no intention of stealing it. No matter how expensive it looks.
2-female_removing_accessory=thinking.png,Your ~clothing~, huh?
2-female_removing_accessory=thinking.png,I know I removed my Log Pose last time, which is also small. But it's <i>really</i> valuable.
2-female_removing_accessory=serious.png,Are you waiting for me to complain about this even though I removed a small item last time too? I don't care, I'll still do it.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sola&stage;0:,id:73=smug.png,Just the ribbon? Come on, you can do better than that.
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;1:,id:76=smiling.png,So that's where all those fries are going...
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;0:=shocked.png,What the...? Your outfit...
2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;lotte&stage;0:=calm.png,You have a toy wand and all. That's kind of adorable.

2-female_removed_accessory=serious.png,Earlier I would've found this amusing, but not anymore. It's time to get serious.
2-female_removed_accessory=serious.png,This makes me a little impatient. And I'm usually the patient one in my crew.
2-female_removed_accessory=serious.png,I'm just saying if we're gonna play the game like this, we should just switch to regular Poker. It would be less of a hassle.
2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lotte&stage;1:=smiling.png,I mean... what a nice wand! You must be able to do all kinds of magic with that! (She seems like a nice girl, I'll just play along with her fantasy.)

2-female_removed_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:1=sad.png,(I don't know why she's disguised herself, so I'm not gonna try to blow her cover.)
2-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=sad.png,It was just a misunderstanding. I didn't mean to comment on your small size...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=smiling.png,I, uhh,  have a question, Palutena. As a goddess, how would you punish a human for stealing?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1=serious.png,You have hands, don't you? You don't need someone else to undress you just because you're rich.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=sad.png,Y-your tattoo is better than mine. I wasn't trying to compare mine with yours.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=thinking.png,W-well, one of my crew mates uses three swords, which is a lot weirder. So...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:ribbon_girl,targetStage:1=sad.png,Well, not only his arms. He can stretch <i>anywhere</i>. Wow, that sounded kinda dirty...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rin,targetStage:2=thinking.png,So your school still makes you wear a tie even though you can't take it off by yourself? That doesn't make sense.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=sad.png,Stripping together, huh? That's some friendship.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=sad.png,She's fine? That really scared me, I thought you hit her with the sword for a second.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=serious.png,You don't have any other weapons hidden, right? I mean, if you're going to be drinking...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=sad.png,What? You did that on purpose? Didn't you receive any burns?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=serious.png,You're not very bright, are you? Kinda like a female Luffy...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1=shocked.png,Ghosts without knives are still scary...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=calm.png,I've met Devil Fruit users who can float before. Could it be your outfit that allows you to fly and you're just pretending it's you who's doing it?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:weiss_schnee,targetStage:1=smiling.png,Are you looking for new friends, Weiss? Me too! You can call me Big Sister Nami.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:weiss_schnee,targetStage:5=greedy.png,Well, if they're expensive hairpins, I guess I can forgive you. Your hair looks great, by the way!


#lost sandals
3-male_removing_accessory=sad.png,You're taking <i>that</i> off now? You're more unpredictable than the Grand Line...
3-male_removing_accessory=serious.png,Ugh, for once I was hoping you'd take off something else.
3-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;n&stage;1&sayingmarker;sponge:=smiling.png,A puzzle, huh? If I solve it, can I keep whatever is inside?
3-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jotaro&stage;0:=calm.png,Huh?
3-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;n&stage;2:=thinking.png,You sure have a lot of weird artifacts. I have a friend who'd probably like to examine them.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=sad.png,(How is he doing this?)
3-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Yep, exactly like Franky.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Hmmm, now that I look at them, those wings are much bigger than the ones the Skypieans had. Are you from a different sky island?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=greedy.png,That sash looks valuable! Mmmm, I miss that beautiful sky gold...
3-male_removed_accessory=smiling.png,Good thing I'm used to dealing with weird individuals. I bet you're no different, ~name~.
3-male_removed_accessory=smug.png,Alright, I don't have to worry about what you take off. I'll just focus on defeating you enough times.
3-male_removed_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;n&stage;2&saidmarker;sponge&sayingmarker;sponge_explain:=serious.png,I think I understood like 50% of that... Okay, more like 20%.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=sad.png,Your belts disappeared. Is that an ability? But how...?
3-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=thinking.png,(Is he stopping time or something? No, that would be too farfetched and terrifying for a Devil Fruit ability.)
3-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:1=sad.png,And I thought I'd have a chance to relax in this game without dealing with weird individuals.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=smiling.png,Wow, a sky archipelago! I'd love to see it one day, but there's no way I'm going to the White Sea through the Knock Up Stream again.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=smiling.png,Don't worry, I have no intention of stealing it. No matter how expensive it looks.
3-female_removing_accessory=furious.png,I liked you when I first saw you, ~name~. But you're really pushing it!
3-female_removing_accessory=serious.png,Just what are you up to, ~name~?
3-female_removing_accessory=thinking.png,You think I can't figure out your game, ~name~? Huh? Well... Umm...
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sola&stage;0:,id:73=smug.png,Just the ribbon? Come on, you can do better than that.
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;1:,id:76=smiling.png,So that's where all those fries are going...
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;0:=shocked.png,What the...? Your outfit...
3-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;lotte&stage;0:=calm.png,You have a toy wand and all. That's kind of adorable.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:rin,targetStage:1,count-emi:0=serious.png,What are you waiting for, ~player~? Help her.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5,id:18=shocked.png,AHHHH!!! What is that on your back?!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:0=greedy.png,That bag doesn't look expensive, but...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy_white,targetStage:0=serious.png,It is tight. And if I may say it, it's riding a little high on the back.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:caulifla,targetStage:0=shocked.png,So that's your natural hair? Sorry, I didn't mean to imply it's weird, or anything. It's actually very normal and... pointy.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Oh, I have a friend who fights using kicks. (Look at those legs...)
3-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3=thinking.png,That choker... It doesn't look very valuable. Does it have some special meaning to you?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=thinking.png,Eh? Where did she go?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=thinking.png,I just need to make sure, but you have nothing to do with Buggy the clown, do you?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=smiling.png,You really are quite beautiful, Jura. And that dress...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=serious.png,Wow. You look innocent and cute, but you're actually a pervert, aren't you?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=shocked.png,Eh? What happened to you?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:leggy,targetStage:0=calm.png,Not a Mink, huh? Then are you a Devil Fruit user...?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=smiling.png,Are you really gonna keep your camera? Why? Y-you're not gonna use it, right? Heheh...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=serious.png,Oh, a ladybug! That's makes more sense. Wait, is that a yo-yo? I'm more confused now.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:1=thinking.png,So... how come you can fly? Devil Fruit? Science? Some sort of illusion?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You clearly don't look like a conventional pirate, but you still have a sort of eye patch, heheh.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:0=calm.png,Nice beret. Maybe I should get myself one. Oh, but is it part of your uniform?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:0=smiling.png,Yeah, very manly...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:mythra,targetStage:0=greedy.png,Those aren't emeralds, are they? There's so many...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Oh, sorry! You just seem a lot younger at first glance.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=smiling.png,I didn't mean to imply I have a problem with that. I just don't want to you get in trouble with your boss.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=thinking.png,So do you live on a Sky Island? Is it on the Grand Line?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:2=greedy.png,(She's wearing all these expensive looking accessories... But she's a goddess... But they look so valuable...)
3-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0=sad.png,This is why you brought your butler? Talk about spoiled...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=smiling.png,H-hey, nice tattoo you have there, sister. I have one too, see? On my left shoulder?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=smiling.png,So... two guns, huh? Is one not enough?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:ribbon_girl,targetStage:0=calm.png,Oh, Luffy is my captain. He can also stretch his arms, since he's pretty much made of rubber.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=serious.png,Why is she on the floor taking off your shoes? I thought she was your friend, but she's acting more like an slave.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=shocked.png,Mako!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=shocked.png,You don't have any grenades in there, right? What if one goes off?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=shocked.png,FIRE! Let me use my Clima-Tact to extinguish it!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=shocked.png,Hey, that's your head!
3-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=sad.png,It doesn't look like one of the ghost of that girl from Thriller Bark, but it has a knife...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=thinking.png,This thing you call <i>Quirk</i> is your Devil Fruit ability, right? It must be a cultural difference, like how in Wano they call them sorcery.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss_schnee,targetStage:0=greedy.png,Ohhh, <i>very</i> rich! That necklace looks expensive...
3-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss_schnee,targetStage:4=furious.png,Your hairpins? But you're in your underwear! And...
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStatus:exposed=serious.png,Why didn't you take this off before showing your other parts? I don't understand.
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStatus:exposed=serious.png,Alright. You clearly don't care about what to show first.
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStatus:naked=thinking.png,If only you'd had this when you still weren't naked. Oh, wait, you did. Then...
3-female_removing_accessory,targetStatus:naked=serious.png,Really? But why did you had to be naked before you removed your ~clothing~? You're weird.
3-female_removed_accessory=sad.png,Ugh... Why is everyone like this?
3-female_removed_accessory=serious.png,I won't let this get to me. I'll prove it on the next round.
3-female_removed_accessory=serious.png,You never really know a person, do you?
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lotte&stage;1:=smiling.png,I mean... what a nice wand! You must be able to do all kinds of magic with that! (She seems like a nice girl, I'll just play along with her fantasy.)
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sola&stage;1:,id:74=smiling.png,Oh, you're actually removing something else too. I honestly didn't think you would.
3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;1:=thinking.png,That's a Devil Fruit ability, right? Transforming clothes... It's kinda like Kin'emon's.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6=shocked.png,So you are a Devil Fruit user? A snake woman, or something?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:1=thinking.png,How expensive would you say it is, exactly?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy_white,targetStage:1=furious.png,Fine! You know what? Your leotard is skimpy, and your ass is completely exposed. Happy?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=calm.png,If I did, would my legs become as... strong as yours?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:4=smiling.png,Sentimental value is not something you can understand unless you feel it. I would never steal something that important to another person.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=furious.png,You tried to run away?! That does it, I won't feel sorry for you anymore.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=serious.png,His red nose is real, can you believe that?. What a freak... I'm happy Luffy kicked his ass.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=embarrassed.png,W-well, we cute pirate girls usually get a lot of attention. I just thought you might relate to that.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=sad.png,I don't know that many perverted woman, and it's a little baffling to meet one that looks like she jumped out of a children's book.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=furious.png,Don't shoot right next to me, you crazy woman!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=furious.png,Hey! Don't just drop that, it's a loaded gun!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:leggy,targetStage:1=thinking.png,Not a Devil Fruit user either? Then... what are you?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=sad.png,I have nothing personal against your look, but I don't like bugs very much.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=thinking.png,Fair enough. I guess there isn't such a thing as a <i>conventional pirate</i>. Still, there's something different about you.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=thinking.png,Where do you work, Misato? That's a cute uniform.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:1,targetSaying:delete=serious.png,Delete what? Your shoes? What are you talking about?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:1=sad.png,(I don't know why she's disguised herself, so I'm not gonna try to blow her cover.)

4-male_removed_accessory=serious.png,When I get my Clima-Tact back, I'm gonna summon a storm to follow you around.
4-male_removed_accessory=serious.png,Great, now I'm in a bad mood.
4-male_removed_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;n&stage;2&saidmarker;sponge&sayingmarker;sponge_explain:=serious.png,I think I understood like 50% of that... Okay, more like 20%.

4-female_removing_accessory,targetStatus:exposed=serious.png,Alright. You clearly don't care about what to show first.
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStatus:naked=thinking.png,If only you'd had this when you still weren't naked. Oh, wait, you did. Then...
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStatus:naked=serious.png,Really? But why did you had to be naked before you removed your ~clothing~? You're weird.
4-female_removed_accessory=serious.png,Hey, maybe I have something in...? Hmph, what am I thinking? I don't even have pockets anymore...
4-female_removed_accessory=serious.png,Now I have no choice but to give it my best shot.
4-female_removed_accessory=smiling.png,Hey, I'm still wearing my earrings! Oh, they don't count? Shoot...
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lotte&stage;1:=smiling.png,I mean... what a nice wand! You must be able to do all kinds of magic with that! (She seems like a nice girl, I'll just play along with her fantasy.)
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sola&stage;1:,id:74=smiling.png,Oh, you're actually removing something else too. I honestly didn't think you would.
4-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;1:=thinking.png,That's a Devil Fruit ability, right? Transforming clothes... It's kinda like Kin'emon's.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6=shocked.png,So you are a Devil Fruit user? A snake woman, or something?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:1=thinking.png,How expensive would you say it is, exactly?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy_white,targetStage:1=furious.png,Fine! You know what? Your leotard is skimpy, and your ass is completely exposed. Happy?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=calm.png,If I did, would my legs become as... strong as yours?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:4=smiling.png,Sentimental value is not something you can understand unless you feel it. I would never steal something that important to another person.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=furious.png,You tried to run away?! That does it, I won't feel sorry for you anymore.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=serious.png,His red nose is real, can you believe that?. What a freak... I'm happy Luffy kicked his ass.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=embarrassed.png,W-well, we cute pirate girls usually get a lot of attention. I just thought you might relate to that.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=sad.png,I don't know that many perverted woman, and it's a little baffling to meet one that looks like she jumped out of a children's book.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=furious.png,Don't shoot right next to me, you crazy woman!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=furious.png,Hey! Don't just drop that, it's a loaded gun!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:leggy,targetStage:1=thinking.png,Not a Devil Fruit user either? Then... what are you?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=sad.png,I have nothing personal against your look, but I don't like bugs very much.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=thinking.png,Fair enough. I guess there isn't such a thing as a <i>conventional pirate</i>. Still, there's something different about you.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=thinking.png,Where do you work, Misato? That's a cute uniform.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:1,targetSaying:delete=serious.png,Delete what? Your shoes? What are you talking about?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:1=sad.png,(I don't know why she's disguised herself, so I'm not gonna try to blow her cover.)
4-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=sad.png,It was just a misunderstanding. I didn't mean to comment on your small size...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=smiling.png,I, uhh,  have a question, Palutena. As a goddess, how would you punish a human for stealing?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1=serious.png,You have hands, don't you? You don't need someone else to undress you just because you're rich.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=sad.png,Y-your tattoo is better than mine. I wasn't trying to compare mine with yours.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=thinking.png,W-well, one of my crew mates uses three swords, which is a lot weirder. So...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:ribbon_girl,targetStage:1=sad.png,Well, not only his arms. He can stretch <i>anywhere</i>. Wow, that sounded kinda dirty...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:rin,targetStage:2=thinking.png,So your school still makes you wear a tie even though you can't take it off by yourself? That doesn't make sense.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=sad.png,Stripping together, huh? That's some friendship.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=sad.png,She's fine? That really scared me, I thought you hit her with the sword for a second.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=serious.png,You don't have any other weapons hidden, right? I mean, if you're going to be drinking...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=sad.png,What? You did that on purpose? Didn't you receive any burns?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=serious.png,You're not very bright, are you? Kinda like a female Luffy...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1=shocked.png,Ghosts without knives are still scary...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=calm.png,I've met Devil Fruit users who can float before. Could it be your outfit that allows you to fly and you're just pretending it's you who's doing it?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:weiss_schnee,targetStage:1=smiling.png,Are you looking for new friends, Weiss? Me too! You can call me Big Sister Nami.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:weiss_schnee,targetStage:5=greedy.png,Well, if they're expensive hairpins, I guess I can forgive you. Your hair looks great, by the way!


#lost top
5-male_removing_accessory=serious.png,Of course you're taking off your ~clothing~. Why are you like that?
5-male_removing_accessory=serious.png,Your ~clothing~... what a crappy move.
5-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;n&stage;1&sayingmarker;sponge:=smiling.png,A puzzle, huh? If I solve it, can I keep whatever is inside?
5-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jotaro&stage;0:=calm.png,Huh?
5-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;n&stage;2:=thinking.png,You sure have a lot of weird artifacts. I have a friend who'd probably like to examine them.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=sad.png,(How is he doing this?)
5-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Yep, exactly like Franky.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Hmmm, now that I look at them, those wings are much bigger than the ones the Skypieans had. Are you from a different sky island?
5-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=greedy.png,That sash looks valuable! Mmmm, I miss that beautiful sky gold...
5-male_removed_accessory=calm.png,You know, if you were a little nicer to other people, they might treat you better too.
5-male_removed_accessory=calm.png,You won't earn any points with me by acting like a jerk.
5-male_removed_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;n&stage;2&saidmarker;sponge&sayingmarker;sponge_explain:=serious.png,I think I understood like 50% of that... Okay, more like 20%.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=sad.png,Your belts disappeared. Is that an ability? But how...?
5-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=thinking.png,(Is he stopping time or something? No, that would be too farfetched and terrifying for a Devil Fruit ability.)
5-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:1=sad.png,And I thought I'd have a chance to relax in this game without dealing with weird individuals.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=smiling.png,Wow, a sky archipelago! I'd love to see it one day, but there's no way I'm going to the White Sea through the Knock Up Stream again.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=smiling.png,Don't worry, I have no intention of stealing it. No matter how expensive it looks.
5-female_removing_accessory=furious.png,I know what I'm going to do with your ~clothing~. I'll steal it and sell it to anyone at a very cheap price!
5-female_removing_accessory=furious.png,How would you feel if I steal your ~clothing~ and sell it to the first person who wants ~clothing.ifPlural(them|it)~?
5-female_removing_accessory=furious.png,Wouldn't it be fun if <i>someone</i> stole your ~clothing~ and sold it? If it was me, I wouldn't even ask more than a measly price for it.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sola&stage;0:,id:73=smug.png,Just the ribbon? Come on, you can do better than that.
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;1:,id:76=smiling.png,So that's where all those fries are going...
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;0:=shocked.png,What the...? Your outfit...
5-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;lotte&stage;0:=calm.png,You have a toy wand and all. That's kind of adorable.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:rin,targetStage:1,count-emi:0=serious.png,What are you waiting for, ~player~? Help her.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5,id:18=shocked.png,AHHHH!!! What is that on your back?!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:0=greedy.png,That bag doesn't look expensive, but...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy_white,targetStage:0=serious.png,It is tight. And if I may say it, it's riding a little high on the back.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:caulifla,targetStage:0=shocked.png,So that's your natural hair? Sorry, I didn't mean to imply it's weird, or anything. It's actually very normal and... pointy.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Oh, I have a friend who fights using kicks. (Look at those legs...)
5-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3=thinking.png,That choker... It doesn't look very valuable. Does it have some special meaning to you?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=thinking.png,Eh? Where did she go?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=thinking.png,I just need to make sure, but you have nothing to do with Buggy the clown, do you?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=smiling.png,You really are quite beautiful, Jura. And that dress...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=serious.png,Wow. You look innocent and cute, but you're actually a pervert, aren't you?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=shocked.png,Eh? What happened to you?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:leggy,targetStage:0=calm.png,Not a Mink, huh? Then are you a Devil Fruit user...?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=smiling.png,Are you really gonna keep your camera? Why? Y-you're not gonna use it, right? Heheh...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=serious.png,Oh, a ladybug! That's makes more sense. Wait, is that a yo-yo? I'm more confused now.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:1=thinking.png,So... how come you can fly? Devil Fruit? Science? Some sort of illusion?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You clearly don't look like a conventional pirate, but you still have a sort of eye patch, heheh.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:0=calm.png,Nice beret. Maybe I should get myself one. Oh, but is it part of your uniform?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:0=smiling.png,Yeah, very manly...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mythra,targetStage:0=greedy.png,Those aren't emeralds, are they? There's so many...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Oh, sorry! You just seem a lot younger at first glance.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=smiling.png,I didn't mean to imply I have a problem with that. I just don't want to you get in trouble with your boss.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=thinking.png,So do you live on a Sky Island? Is it on the Grand Line?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:2=greedy.png,(She's wearing all these expensive looking accessories... But she's a goddess... But they look so valuable...)
5-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0=sad.png,This is why you brought your butler? Talk about spoiled...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=smiling.png,H-hey, nice tattoo you have there, sister. I have one too, see? On my left shoulder?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=smiling.png,So... two guns, huh? Is one not enough?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:ribbon_girl,targetStage:0=calm.png,Oh, Luffy is my captain. He can also stretch his arms, since he's pretty much made of rubber.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=serious.png,Why is she on the floor taking off your shoes? I thought she was your friend, but she's acting more like an slave.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=shocked.png,Mako!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=shocked.png,You don't have any grenades in there, right? What if one goes off?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=shocked.png,FIRE! Let me use my Clima-Tact to extinguish it!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=shocked.png,Hey, that's your head!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=sad.png,It doesn't look like one of the ghost of that girl from Thriller Bark, but it has a knife...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=thinking.png,This thing you call <i>Quirk</i> is your Devil Fruit ability, right? It must be a cultural difference, like how in Wano they call them sorcery.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss_schnee,targetStage:0=greedy.png,Ohhh, <i>very</i> rich! That necklace looks expensive...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss_schnee,targetStage:4=furious.png,Your hairpins? But you're in your underwear! And...
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStatus:exposed=serious.png,Why didn't you take this off before showing your other parts? I don't understand.

5-female_removed_accessory=smiling.png,No, what am I saying? I'll sell it at a good price, of course!
5-female_removed_accessory=thinking.png,Hmmm, that's not true. I'll try to get as much out of it as I can.
5-female_removed_accessory=greedy.png,Yeah, maybe 30,000 beli? No, 50,000!
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lotte&stage;1:=smiling.png,I mean... what a nice wand! You must be able to do all kinds of magic with that! (She seems like a nice girl, I'll just play along with her fantasy.)
5-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sola&stage;1:,id:74=smiling.png,Oh, you're actually removing something else too. I honestly didn't think you would.

-3-female_removing_accessory,target:leggy,targetStage:0=calm.png,Not a Mink, huh? Then are you a Devil Fruit user...?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=smiling.png,Are you really gonna keep your camera? Why? Y-you're not gonna use it, right? Heheh...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=serious.png,Oh, a ladybug! That's makes more sense. Wait, is that a yo-yo? I'm more confused now.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:1=thinking.png,So... how come you can fly? Devil Fruit? Science? Some sort of illusion?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You clearly don't look like a conventional pirate, but you still have a sort of eye patch, heheh.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:0=calm.png,Nice beret. Maybe I should get myself one. Oh, but is it part of your uniform?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:0=smiling.png,Yeah, very manly...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mythra,targetStage:0=greedy.png,Those aren't emeralds, are they? There's so many...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Oh, sorry! You just seem a lot younger at first glance.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=smiling.png,I didn't mean to imply I have a problem with that. I just don't want to you get in trouble with your boss.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=thinking.png,So do you live on a Sky Island? Is it on the Grand Line?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:2=greedy.png,(She's wearing all these expensive looking accessories... But she's a goddess... But they look so valuable...)
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0=sad.png,This is why you brought your butler? Talk about spoiled...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=smiling.png,H-hey, nice tattoo you have there, sister. I have one too, see? On my left shoulder?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=smiling.png,So... two guns, huh? Is one not enough?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:ribbon_girl,targetStage:0=calm.png,Oh, Luffy is my captain. He can also stretch his arms, since he's pretty much made of rubber.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=serious.png,Why is she on the floor taking off your shoes? I thought she was your friend, but she's acting more like an slave.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=shocked.png,Mako!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=shocked.png,You don't have any grenades in there, right? What if one goes off?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=shocked.png,FIRE! Let me use my Clima-Tact to extinguish it!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=shocked.png,Hey, that's your head!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=sad.png,It doesn't look like one of the ghost of that girl from Thriller Bark, but it has a knife...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=thinking.png,This thing you call <i>Quirk</i> is your Devil Fruit ability, right? It must be a cultural difference, like how in Wano they call them sorcery.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss_schnee,targetStage:0=greedy.png,Ohhh, <i>very</i> rich! That necklace looks expensive...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss_schnee,targetStage:4=furious.png,Your hairpins? But you're in your underwear! And...
-3-female_removing_accessory,targetStatus:exposed=serious.png,Why didn't you take this off before showing your other parts? I don't understand.
-3-female_removing_accessory,targetStatus:exposed=serious.png,Alright. You clearly don't care about what to show first.
-3-female_removing_accessory,targetStatus:naked=thinking.png,If only you'd had this when you still weren't naked. Oh, wait, you did. Then...
-3-female_removing_accessory,targetStatus:naked=serious.png,Really? But why did you had to be naked before you removed your ~clothing~? You're weird.
-3-female_removed_accessory=embarrassed.png,There's so little difference in clothes between wearing a bikini and being naked, and yet it feels completely different.
-3-female_removed_accessory=serious.png,Do this again, and I'll make you physically unable to get dressed by yourself.
-3-female_removed_accessory=serious.png,Pray that nobody finds your body at the bottom of the sea a 100 years from now, ~name~.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lotte&stage;1:=smiling.png,I mean... what a nice wand! You must be able to do all kinds of magic with that! (She seems like a nice girl, I'll just play along with her fantasy.)
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sola&stage;1:,id:74=smiling.png,Oh, you're actually removing something else too. I honestly didn't think you would.
-3-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;1:=thinking.png,That's a Devil Fruit ability, right? Transforming clothes... It's kinda like Kin'emon's.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6=shocked.png,So you are a Devil Fruit user? A snake woman, or something?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:1=thinking.png,How expensive would you say it is, exactly?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy_white,targetStage:1=furious.png,Fine! You know what? Your leotard is skimpy, and your ass is completely exposed. Happy?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=calm.png,If I did, would my legs become as... strong as yours?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:4=smiling.png,Sentimental value is not something you can understand unless you feel it. I would never steal something that important to another person.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=furious.png,You tried to run away?! That does it, I won't feel sorry for you anymore.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=serious.png,His red nose is real, can you believe that?. What a freak... I'm happy Luffy kicked his ass.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=embarrassed.png,W-well, we cute pirate girls usually get a lot of attention. I just thought you might relate to that.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=sad.png,I don't know that many perverted woman, and it's a little baffling to meet one that looks like she jumped out of a children's book.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=furious.png,Don't shoot right next to me, you crazy woman!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=furious.png,Hey! Don't just drop that, it's a loaded gun!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:leggy,targetStage:1=thinking.png,Not a Devil Fruit user either? Then... what are you?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=sad.png,I have nothing personal against your look, but I don't like bugs very much.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=thinking.png,Fair enough. I guess there isn't such a thing as a <i>conventional pirate</i>. Still, there's something different about you.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=thinking.png,Where do you work, Misato? That's a cute uniform.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:1,targetSaying:delete=serious.png,Delete what? Your shoes? What are you talking about?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:1=sad.png,(I don't know why she's disguised herself, so I'm not gonna try to blow her cover.)
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=sad.png,It was just a misunderstanding. I didn't mean to comment on your small size...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=smiling.png,I, uhh,  have a question, Palutena. As a goddess, how would you punish a human for stealing?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1=serious.png,You have hands, don't you? You don't need someone else to undress you just because you're rich.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=sad.png,Y-your tattoo is better than mine. I wasn't trying to compare mine with yours.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=thinking.png,W-well, one of my crew mates uses three swords, which is a lot weirder. So...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:ribbon_girl,targetStage:1=sad.png,Well, not only his arms. He can stretch <i>anywhere</i>. Wow, that sounded kinda dirty...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:rin,targetStage:2=thinking.png,So your school still makes you wear a tie even though you can't take it off by yourself? That doesn't make sense.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=sad.png,Stripping together, huh? That's some friendship.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=sad.png,She's fine? That really scared me, I thought you hit her with the sword for a second.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=serious.png,You don't have any other weapons hidden, right? I mean, if you're going to be drinking...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=sad.png,What? You did that on purpose? Didn't you receive any burns?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=serious.png,You're not very bright, are you? Kinda like a female Luffy...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1=shocked.png,Ghosts without knives are still scary...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=calm.png,I've met Devil Fruit users who can float before. Could it be your outfit that allows you to fly and you're just pretending it's you who's doing it?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:weiss_schnee,targetStage:1=smiling.png,Are you looking for new friends, Weiss? Me too! You can call me Big Sister Nami.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:weiss_schnee,targetStage:5=greedy.png,Well, if they're expensive hairpins, I guess I can forgive you. Your hair looks great, by the way!


#masturbating
-2-male_removing_accessory=custom:sad,I swear, men make an even bigger deal than women about showing a little skin.
-2-male_removing_accessory=custom:smug,Figures you're trying to grasp every small opportunity you have to show less skin.
-2-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;n&stage;1&sayingmarker;sponge:=smiling.png,A puzzle, huh? If I solve it, can I keep whatever is inside?
-2-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;jotaro&stage;0:=calm.png,Huh?
-2-male_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;n&stage;2:=thinking.png,You sure have a lot of weird artifacts. I have a friend who'd probably like to examine them.
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=sad.png,(How is he doing this?)
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Yep, exactly like Franky.
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Hmmm, now that I look at them, those wings are much bigger than the ones the Skypieans had. Are you from a different sky island?
-2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=greedy.png,That sash looks valuable! Mmmm, I miss that beautiful sky gold...
-2-male_removed_accessory=custom:calm,It's just your body. Are you really ashamed of it?
-2-male_removed_accessory=custom:serious,Whatever, it's not like I want to see <i>you</i> naked.
-2-male_removed_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;n&stage;2&saidmarker;sponge&sayingmarker;sponge_explain:=serious.png,I think I understood like 50% of that... Okay, more like 20%.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=sad.png,Your belts disappeared. Is that an ability? But how...?
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=thinking.png,(Is he stopping time or something? No, that would be too farfetched and terrifying for a Devil Fruit ability.)
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:1=sad.png,And I thought I'd have a chance to relax in this game without dealing with weird individuals.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=smiling.png,Wow, a sky archipelago! I'd love to see it one day, but there's no way I'm going to the White Sea through the Knock Up Stream again.
-2-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=smiling.png,Don't worry, I have no intention of stealing it. No matter how expensive it looks.
-2-female_removing_accessory=custom:sad,If I'd come here covered in accessories, I would probably still be playing.
-2-female_removing_accessory=custom:serious,I'm a fashionable woman, and I still don't wear this many accessories.
-2-female_removing_accessory=custom:furious,Where did you buy that, ~name~? I would love to go there, buy 100 of them, come back here and <i>win this stupid game</i>!
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sola&stage;0:,id:73=smug.png,Just the ribbon? Come on, you can do better than that.
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;1:,id:76=smiling.png,So that's where all those fries are going...
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;0:=shocked.png,What the...? Your outfit...
-2-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;lotte&stage;0:=calm.png,You have a toy wand and all. That's kind of adorable.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:rin,targetStage:1,count-emi:0=serious.png,What are you waiting for, ~player~? Help her.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5,id:18=shocked.png,AHHHH!!! What is that on your back?!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:0=greedy.png,That bag doesn't look expensive, but...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy_white,targetStage:0=serious.png,It is tight. And if I may say it, it's riding a little high on the back.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:caulifla,targetStage:0=shocked.png,So that's your natural hair? Sorry, I didn't mean to imply it's weird, or anything. It's actually very normal and... pointy.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Oh, I have a friend who fights using kicks. (Look at those legs...)
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3=thinking.png,That choker... It doesn't look very valuable. Does it have some special meaning to you?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=thinking.png,Eh? Where did she go?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=thinking.png,I just need to make sure, but you have nothing to do with Buggy the clown, do you?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=smiling.png,You really are quite beautiful, Jura. And that dress...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=serious.png,Wow. You look innocent and cute, but you're actually a pervert, aren't you?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=shocked.png,Eh? What happened to you?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:leggy,targetStage:0=calm.png,Not a Mink, huh? Then are you a Devil Fruit user...?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=smiling.png,Are you really gonna keep your camera? Why? Y-you're not gonna use it, right? Heheh...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=serious.png,Oh, a ladybug! That's makes more sense. Wait, is that a yo-yo? I'm more confused now.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:1=thinking.png,So... how come you can fly? Devil Fruit? Science? Some sort of illusion?

-2-female_removed_accessory=custom:thinking,Okay, I'll just be the bigger person here and admire this move. Well played, ~name~.
-2-female_removed_accessory=custom:greedy,(Hmmm, maybe I can snatch her ~clothing~ after the game is over and sell it. Wouldn't that serve her right?)
-2-female_removed_accessory=custom:calm,Eh, whatever. It's not worth it. Water under the bridge, as they say.
-2-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lotte&stage;1:=smiling.png,I mean... what a nice wand! You must be able to do all kinds of magic with that! (She seems like a nice girl, I'll just play along with her fantasy.)

-1-male_removed_accessory=serious.png,I bet you think you're so funny with your goofy ~clothing~. Oh, it's not a joke? Then forget I said anything.
-1-male_removed_accessory,priority:381,count-role;target&character;n&stage;2&saidmarker;sponge&sayingmarker;sponge_explain:=serious.png,I think I understood like 50% of that... Okay, more like 20%.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=sad.png,Your belts disappeared. Is that an ability? But how...?
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=thinking.png,(Is he stopping time or something? No, that would be too farfetched and terrifying for a Devil Fruit ability.)
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:kamina,targetStage:1=sad.png,And I thought I'd have a chance to relax in this game without dealing with weird individuals.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1=smiling.png,Wow, a sky archipelago! I'd love to see it one day, but there's no way I'm going to the White Sea through the Knock Up Stream again.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:2=smiling.png,Don't worry, I have no intention of stealing it. No matter how expensive it looks.
-1-female_removing_accessory=greedy.png,Hmm, you sure held on to your ~clothing~ for a long time. It must be valuable, huh?
-1-female_removing_accessory=greedy.png,I wasn't paying much attention to the items back when I was playing the game, but some of them look very valuable.
-1-female_removing_accessory=greedy.png,This place would be a perfect target for an skilled thief. Good thing there isn't one among us.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;sola&stage;0:,id:73=smug.png,Just the ribbon? Come on, you can do better than that.
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;1:,id:76=smiling.png,So that's where all those fries are going...
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;0:=shocked.png,What the...? Your outfit...
-1-female_removing_accessory,count-role;target&character;lotte&stage;0:=calm.png,You have a toy wand and all. That's kind of adorable.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:rin,targetStage:1,count-emi:0=serious.png,What are you waiting for, ~player~? Help her.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5,id:18=shocked.png,AHHHH!!! What is that on your back?!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:0=greedy.png,That bag doesn't look expensive, but...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy_white,targetStage:0=serious.png,It is tight. And if I may say it, it's riding a little high on the back.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:caulifla,targetStage:0=shocked.png,So that's your natural hair? Sorry, I didn't mean to imply it's weird, or anything. It's actually very normal and... pointy.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Oh, I have a friend who fights using kicks. (Look at those legs...)
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:3=thinking.png,That choker... It doesn't look very valuable. Does it have some special meaning to you?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=thinking.png,Eh? Where did she go?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=thinking.png,I just need to make sure, but you have nothing to do with Buggy the clown, do you?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=smiling.png,You really are quite beautiful, Jura. And that dress...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=serious.png,Wow. You look innocent and cute, but you're actually a pervert, aren't you?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=shocked.png,Eh? What happened to you?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:leggy,targetStage:0=calm.png,Not a Mink, huh? Then are you a Devil Fruit user...?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=smiling.png,Are you really gonna keep your camera? Why? Y-you're not gonna use it, right? Heheh...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=serious.png,Oh, a ladybug! That's makes more sense. Wait, is that a yo-yo? I'm more confused now.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mavis,targetStage:1=thinking.png,So... how come you can fly? Devil Fruit? Science? Some sort of illusion?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=smiling.png,You clearly don't look like a conventional pirate, but you still have a sort of eye patch, heheh.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:0=calm.png,Nice beret. Maybe I should get myself one. Oh, but is it part of your uniform?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:0=smiling.png,Yeah, very manly...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mythra,targetStage:0=greedy.png,Those aren't emeralds, are they? There's so many...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Oh, sorry! You just seem a lot younger at first glance.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=smiling.png,I didn't mean to imply I have a problem with that. I just don't want to you get in trouble with your boss.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=thinking.png,So do you live on a Sky Island? Is it on the Grand Line?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:2=greedy.png,(She's wearing all these expensive looking accessories... But she's a goddess... But they look so valuable...)
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:0=sad.png,This is why you brought your butler? Talk about spoiled...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=smiling.png,H-hey, nice tattoo you have there, sister. I have one too, see? On my left shoulder?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=smiling.png,So... two guns, huh? Is one not enough?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:ribbon_girl,targetStage:0=calm.png,Oh, Luffy is my captain. He can also stretch his arms, since he's pretty much made of rubber.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=serious.png,Why is she on the floor taking off your shoes? I thought she was your friend, but she's acting more like an slave.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=shocked.png,Mako!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=shocked.png,You don't have any grenades in there, right? What if one goes off?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=shocked.png,FIRE! Let me use my Clima-Tact to extinguish it!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=shocked.png,Hey, that's your head!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=sad.png,It doesn't look like one of the ghost of that girl from Thriller Bark, but it has a knife...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=thinking.png,This thing you call <i>Quirk</i> is your Devil Fruit ability, right? It must be a cultural difference, like how in Wano they call them sorcery.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss_schnee,targetStage:0=greedy.png,Ohhh, <i>very</i> rich! That necklace looks expensive...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss_schnee,targetStage:4=furious.png,Your hairpins? But you're in your underwear! And...
-1-female_removing_accessory,targetStatus:exposed=serious.png,Why didn't you take this off before showing your other parts? I don't understand.
-1-female_removing_accessory,targetStatus:exposed=serious.png,Alright. You clearly don't care about what to show first.
-1-female_removing_accessory,targetStatus:naked=thinking.png,If only you'd had this when you still weren't naked. Oh, wait, you did. Then...
-1-female_removing_accessory,targetStatus:naked=serious.png,Really? But why did you had to be naked before you removed your ~clothing~? You're weird.
-1-female_removed_accessory=happy.png,Say, where are the items we stripped kept until the game is over? No reason for asking, just curiosity.
-1-female_removed_accessory=thinking.png,Would I still be playing the game if I'd taken off my bracelet and my Log Pose separately? We'll never know.
-1-female_removed_accessory=smug.png,I bet you're too scared to strip another time, ~name~. Boooh...
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;lotte&stage;1:=smiling.png,I mean... what a nice wand! You must be able to do all kinds of magic with that! (She seems like a nice girl, I'll just play along with her fantasy.)
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;sola&stage;1:,id:74=smiling.png,Oh, you're actually removing something else too. I honestly didn't think you would.
-1-female_removed_accessory,count-role;target&character;akko&stage;1:=thinking.png,That's a Devil Fruit ability, right? Transforming clothes... It's kinda like Kin'emon's.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6=shocked.png,So you are a Devil Fruit user? A snake woman, or something?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:amalia,targetStage:1=thinking.png,How expensive would you say it is, exactly?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy_white,targetStage:1=furious.png,Fine! You know what? Your leotard is skimpy, and your ass is completely exposed. Happy?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=calm.png,If I did, would my legs become as... strong as yours?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:4=smiling.png,Sentimental value is not something you can understand unless you feel it. I would never steal something that important to another person.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=furious.png,You tried to run away?! That does it, I won't feel sorry for you anymore.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:1=serious.png,His red nose is real, can you believe that?. What a freak... I'm happy Luffy kicked his ass.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=embarrassed.png,W-well, we cute pirate girls usually get a lot of attention. I just thought you might relate to that.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=sad.png,I don't know that many perverted woman, and it's a little baffling to meet one that looks like she jumped out of a children's book.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=furious.png,Don't shoot right next to me, you crazy woman!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=furious.png,Hey! Don't just drop that, it's a loaded gun!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:leggy,targetStage:1=thinking.png,Not a Devil Fruit user either? Then... what are you?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=sad.png,I have nothing personal against your look, but I don't like bugs very much.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=thinking.png,Fair enough. I guess there isn't such a thing as a <i>conventional pirate</i>. Still, there's something different about you.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=thinking.png,Where do you work, Misato? That's a cute uniform.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:1,targetSaying:delete=serious.png,Delete what? Your shoes? What are you talking about?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mulan,targetStage:1=sad.png,(I don't know why she's disguised herself, so I'm not gonna try to blow her cover.)
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=sad.png,It was just a misunderstanding. I didn't mean to comment on your small size...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=smiling.png,I, uhh,  have a question, Palutena. As a goddess, how would you punish a human for stealing?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:remilia,targetStage:1=serious.png,You have hands, don't you? You don't need someone else to undress you just because you're rich.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=sad.png,Y-your tattoo is better than mine. I wasn't trying to compare mine with yours.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=thinking.png,W-well, one of my crew mates uses three swords, which is a lot weirder. So...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:ribbon_girl,targetStage:1=sad.png,Well, not only his arms. He can stretch <i>anywhere</i>. Wow, that sounded kinda dirty...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:rin,targetStage:2=thinking.png,So your school still makes you wear a tie even though you can't take it off by yourself? That doesn't make sense.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=sad.png,Stripping together, huh? That's some friendship.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=sad.png,She's fine? That really scared me, I thought you hit her with the sword for a second.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=serious.png,You don't have any other weapons hidden, right? I mean, if you're going to be drinking...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=sad.png,What? You did that on purpose? Didn't you receive any burns?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=serious.png,You're not very bright, are you? Kinda like a female Luffy...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1=shocked.png,Ghosts without knives are still scary...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=calm.png,I've met Devil Fruit users who can float before. Could it be your outfit that allows you to fly and you're just pretending it's you who's doing it?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:weiss_schnee,targetStage:1=smiling.png,Are you looking for new friends, Weiss? Me too! You can call me Big Sister Nami.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:weiss_schnee,targetStage:5=greedy.png,Well, if they're expensive hairpins, I guess I can forgive you. Your hair looks great, by the way!




#OPPONENT REMOVING MINOR CLOTHING
#Minor pieces of clothing don't reveal much when removed, but probably indicate more progress than accessory removal.

#fully clothed
0-male_removing_minor=calm.png,Alright, if that's all you are capable of...
0-male_removing_minor=smiling.png,Psst, just what I was expecting.
0-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;ryuji&stage;0:=smiling.png,By any chance, that logo on your shirt isn't an emblem for some sort of organization, band, or... pirate crew, right?
0-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;dust&stage;5:=thinking.png,What wrong with taking off the hat? It only covers your face. And if I may say it, it's not very stylish.
0-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:6=sad.png,That cape is way too tacky for my taste, same as the glasses. I don't know why you saved it for last.
0-male_removed_minor=smug.png,I bet you aren't capable of taking off something bigger next time you lose. If you want, prove me wrong.
0-male_removed_minor=calm.png,This is boring. Let's just continue with the game.
0-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;dust&stage;6:=smiling.png,See? You're a lot cuter without the hat. Garchu!
0-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:7=serious.png,(I hope this guy never meets Luffy and the others. They'd get along immediately, and then annoy me to no end.)
0-female_removing_minor=calm.png,Okaaay, I'm making some progress here.
0-female_removing_minor=thinking.png,I was just going to ask you, where did you get your ~clothing~?
0-female_removing_minor=smiling.png,Alright, not too shabby. Good effort, ~name~.
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;6:=thinking.png,I completely forgot you have prosthetic legs. That's why you kept your socks on, huh?
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;haru&stage;2:=smiling.png,Is that sweater as comfortable as it looks? It's also super cute.
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;estelle&stage;1:=thinking.png,It's a big dress. There should be an easy way to take it off.
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;0:=thinking.png,Obsession with food is not good for you. At least Luffy doesn't get fat with all the meat that he eats.
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;mavis&stage;3:=smiling.png,So you like red and black, huh? I prefer lighter colors.
0-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;0:,count-role;self&saidmarker;target1:=smiling.png,You really like ~player~, don't you? (I should be careful trying to seduce ~player~ into losing with her here...)
0-female_removing_minor,target:caulifla,targetStage:2=sad.png,Oh, you can fly too? S-so what?
0-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:bee,targetNotSaidMarker:bee_stop,targetSayingMarker:bee2=shocked.png,Ah!!! A bee! Someone get it out of here!
0-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=thinking.png,I always thought I was young for a navigator, but you are even younger, Futaba. Though I have been drawing maps for as long as I can remember. But it's not a competition, right?
0-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3=calm.png,What's your crew like, Futaba? Since we have a few things in common, I'm guessing they might be a bunch of lovable morons too.
0-female_removing_minor,target:leggy,targetStage:2,id:8=thinking.png,You're shaving off our wool? I guess you really aren't a mink. They're very proud of their hair, after all.
0-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=thinking.png,I would like to see your ship. Judging by your outfit, it bet it has some interesting design for sailing.
0-female_removing_minor,target:miko,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Ah... G-g-g-g-ghoooost!!!
0-female_removing_minor,target:monika,targetStage:1=serious.png,(Her panties are showing again. Is she doing this on purpose to try to entice ~player~?)
0-female_removing_minor,target:mythra,targetStage:1=smug.png,You have so many jewels that I doubt you'd miss a few if they get lost, huh?
0-female_removing_minor,target:mythra,targetStage:1=serious.png,Do you keep a weapon or something there, or is it just for the look?
0-female_removing_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1=serious.png,Still, I wouldn't wear an outfit like that. Not because I don't like it, but because I'm sure it would make the guys think I'm going to do all their chores for them.
0-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0,id:54=calm.png,Oh, she's your wrestling partner? I see... What else do you two do together?
0-female_removing_minor,target:raven,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Huh...?! You can fly...?
0-female_removing_minor,target:sakura,targetStage:2,id:2=serious.png,What's wrong, Sakura? Your skin... Is that a rare disease? I have a doctor in my crew, I'm sure he can help you...
0-female_removing_minor,target:sakura,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:headless,id:3=shocked.png,OH MY GOSH!!! HER HEAD...!!!
0-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=smiling.png,Magic? Sure... But seriously, what is that thing?
0-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:0=thinking.png,I just wanna make sure you know what you're getting into. You look like a nice girl, if maybe a little... lost.
0-female_removing_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=shocked.png,AH! What was that noise?!
0-female_removed_minor=smiling.png,Now that you're without your ~clothing~, let's keep going!
0-female_removed_minor=smug.png,I will claim victory one small step at a time.
0-female_removed_minor=thinking.png,I will make you lose the number of times it takes to beat you,  ~name~. Which judging by your remaining clothes, would be...
0-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;haru&stage;3:=thinking.png,Huh, so sweaters are good for concealing the size of your breasts... I should remember that the next time I need to avoid drawing attention to myself.
0-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;estelle&stage;2&sayingmarker;messy_c=6:=calm.png,What a mess. Too bad I don't have a hair brush to loan you right now.
0-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;1:,id:77=sad.png,You could always buy new clothes that fit you better. But that's so painful...
0-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,count-ann:1=smiling.png,That sounds just like me! I guess every group of outlaws needs a big sister.
0-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,count-haru:1=smiling.png,Looks can be deceiving, alright! That's always part of the strategy.
0-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,count-hifumi:1=smiling.png,She sounds like Robin. Every team needs someone who can keep their composure in times of crisis.
0-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,count-joker:1=smiling.png,Hahah, he couldn't be more different from my captain! Still, I wouldn't replace Luffy for anyone.
0-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,count-kasumi:1=smiling.png,Mysterious... If a little scary, too.
0-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,count-makoto:1=smiling.png,I can already tell you have more smart people in your crew than mine. I wish I could share some of the responsibilities that fall on me all the time. I'm a little jealous.
0-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,count-phantom_thieves:1=smiling.png,Those names make them all sound so mysterious. I guess they're nicknames, since you're a group of thieves.
0-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,count-ryuji:1=smiling.png,Oh, then he would fit perfectly in my own crew. We have a bunch of tough headed goofballs... no offense, Skull.
0-female_removed_minor,target:caulifla,targetStage:3=serious.png,(Why the hell am I trying to pick a fight with her? I'm the smart one, and Luffy isn't here.)
0-female_removed_minor,target:emi,targetStage:7,id:62=smiling.png,You know, maybe Franky could make you some better legs. He's the shipwright of our crew, and like half of his body is machine. It would probably take him like five minutes.
0-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:bee2=serious.png,I get your reaction, Florina. I also hate bugs. Especially the ones that destroy your clothes.
0-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=embarrassed.png,I'm 20. I know, I don't look a day over 18. It's strange that nobody asked my age at the entrance.
0-female_removed_minor,target:leggy,targetStage:3=smiling.png,Well, whatever you are, it's a fact you're super cute!
0-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=calm.png,Uh... I don't know that much about how ships are built, but I didn't understand a word of that. Maybe Franky, the shipwright of our ship, could. Though it might be too outlandish, even for him.
0-female_removed_minor,target:miko,targetStage:1=sad.png,Oh, y-you know her? I'm still shaking...
0-female_removed_minor,target:mythra,targetStage:2=greedy.png,Either way, I don't care. It looks valuable, that's all that matters.
0-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1=smiling.png,O-okay, you don't have to give me that much detail. I'm perfectly fine with it, but I think that's too much information.
0-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1=sad.png,Please ,don't curse me. I was just kidding earlier.
0-female_removed_minor,target:sakura,targetStage:3=shocked.png,Gahhh!!! A zombie! I didn't think I'd have to deal with them after Thriller Bark!
0-female_removed_minor,target:sakura,targetStage:4=furious.png,Why did you do that? You almost kill me! Just when I was okay with you being a zombie.
0-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=greedy.png,I bet it's a rare, expensive jewel. Don't worry, I'm not gonna steal it. I'll just admire it for a while...
0-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1=sad.png,When I see an airhead girl, my maternal instincts naturally kick in. I can't help it.
0-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=furious.png,Explosions now? Are you insane?


#lost belt
1-male_removing_minor=calm.png,Maybe you just want to feel more comfortable. That's why you're taking off your ~clothing~,
1-male_removing_minor=calm.png,Sure, go ahead, get comfortable. It's better to feel good if you think you have a chance to win the game.
1-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;ryuji&stage;0:=smiling.png,By any chance, that logo on your shirt isn't an emblem for some sort of organization, band, or... pirate crew, right?
1-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;dust&stage;5:=thinking.png,What wrong with taking off the hat? It only covers your face. And if I may say it, it's not very stylish.
1-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:6=sad.png,That cape is way too tacky for my taste, same as the glasses. I don't know why you saved it for last.
1-male_removed_minor=smiling.png,I do feel lighter without my belt and my Clima-Tact. I don't blame you.
1-male_removed_minor=smiling.png,Make yourself at home, ~name~. Before you lose again...
1-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;dust&stage;6:=smiling.png,See? You're a lot cuter without the hat. Garchu!
1-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:7=serious.png,(I hope this guy never meets Luffy and the others. They'd get along immediately, and then annoy me to no end.)
1-female_removing_minor=thinking.png,Seeing all these people wearing different clothes makes me want to go shopping.
1-female_removing_minor=thinking.png,So many women wearing different clothes in this place. Should I increase my inventory?
1-female_removing_minor=thinking.png,With all these different clothes everybody's wearing, I'm thinking if my closet is too samey.
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;6:=thinking.png,I completely forgot you have prosthetic legs. That's why you kept your socks on, huh?
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;haru&stage;2:=smiling.png,Is that sweater as comfortable as it looks? It's also super cute.
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;estelle&stage;1:=thinking.png,It's a big dress. There should be an easy way to take it off.
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;0:=thinking.png,Obsession with food is not good for you. At least Luffy doesn't get fat with all the meat that he eats.
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;mavis&stage;3:=smiling.png,So you like red and black, huh? I prefer lighter colors.
1-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;0:,count-role;self&saidmarker;target1:=smiling.png,You really like ~player~, don't you? (I should be careful trying to seduce ~player~ into losing with her here...)
1-female_removing_minor,target:caulifla,targetStage:2=sad.png,Oh, you can fly too? S-so what?
1-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:bee,targetNotSaidMarker:bee_stop,targetSayingMarker:bee2=shocked.png,Ah!!! A bee! Someone get it out of here!
1-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=thinking.png,I always thought I was young for a navigator, but you are even younger, Futaba. Though I have been drawing maps for as long as I can remember. But it's not a competition, right?
1-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3=calm.png,What's your crew like, Futaba? Since we have a few things in common, I'm guessing they might be a bunch of lovable morons too.
1-female_removing_minor,target:leggy,targetStage:2,id:8=thinking.png,You're shaving off our wool? I guess you really aren't a mink. They're very proud of their hair, after all.
1-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=thinking.png,I would like to see your ship. Judging by your outfit, it bet it has some interesting design for sailing.
1-female_removing_minor,target:miko,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Ah... G-g-g-g-ghoooost!!!
1-female_removing_minor,target:monika,targetStage:1=serious.png,(Her panties are showing again. Is she doing this on purpose to try to entice ~player~?)
1-female_removing_minor,target:mythra,targetStage:1=smug.png,You have so many jewels that I doubt you'd miss a few if they get lost, huh?
1-female_removing_minor,target:mythra,targetStage:1=serious.png,Do you keep a weapon or something there, or is it just for the look?
1-female_removing_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1=serious.png,Still, I wouldn't wear an outfit like that. Not because I don't like it, but because I'm sure it would make the guys think I'm going to do all their chores for them.
1-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0,id:54=calm.png,Oh, she's your wrestling partner? I see... What else do you two do together?
1-female_removing_minor,target:raven,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Huh...?! You can fly...?
1-female_removing_minor,target:sakura,targetStage:2,id:2=serious.png,What's wrong, Sakura? Your skin... Is that a rare disease? I have a doctor in my crew, I'm sure he can help you...
1-female_removing_minor,target:sakura,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:headless,id:3=shocked.png,OH MY GOSH!!! HER HEAD...!!!
1-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=smiling.png,Magic? Sure... But seriously, what is that thing?
1-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:0=thinking.png,I just wanna make sure you know what you're getting into. You look like a nice girl, if maybe a little... lost.
1-female_removing_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=shocked.png,AH! What was that noise?!
1-female_removed_minor=calm.png,By the way, where did you get your ~clothing~, ~name~?
1-female_removed_minor=calm.png,Hmmm, I wonder if your ~clothing~ would fit me.
1-female_removed_minor=sad.png,I am forced to dress depending on the weather of the islands we go to, anyway.
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;haru&stage;3:=thinking.png,Huh, so sweaters are good for concealing the size of your breasts... I should remember that the next time I need to avoid drawing attention to myself.
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;estelle&stage;2&sayingmarker;messy_c=6:=calm.png,What a mess. Too bad I don't have a hair brush to loan you right now.
1-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;1:,id:77=sad.png,You could always buy new clothes that fit you better. But that's so painful...
1-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,count-ann:1=smiling.png,That sounds just like me! I guess every group of outlaws needs a big sister.
1-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,count-haru:1=smiling.png,Looks can be deceiving, alright! That's always part of the strategy.
1-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,count-hifumi:1=smiling.png,She sounds like Robin. Every team needs someone who can keep their composure in times of crisis.
1-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,count-joker:1=smiling.png,Hahah, he couldn't be more different from my captain! Still, I wouldn't replace Luffy for anyone.
1-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,count-kasumi:1=smiling.png,Mysterious... If a little scary, too.
1-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,count-makoto:1=smiling.png,I can already tell you have more smart people in your crew than mine. I wish I could share some of the responsibilities that fall on me all the time. I'm a little jealous.
1-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,count-phantom_thieves:1=smiling.png,Those names make them all sound so mysterious. I guess they're nicknames, since you're a group of thieves.
1-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,count-ryuji:1=smiling.png,Oh, then he would fit perfectly in my own crew. We have a bunch of tough headed goofballs... no offense, Skull.
1-female_removed_minor,target:caulifla,targetStage:3=serious.png,(Why the hell am I trying to pick a fight with her? I'm the smart one, and Luffy isn't here.)
1-female_removed_minor,target:emi,targetStage:7,id:62=smiling.png,You know, maybe Franky could make you some better legs. He's the shipwright of our crew, and like half of his body is machine. It would probably take him like five minutes.
1-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:bee2=serious.png,I get your reaction, Florina. I also hate bugs. Especially the ones that destroy your clothes.
1-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=embarrassed.png,I'm 20. I know, I don't look a day over 18. It's strange that nobody asked my age at the entrance.
1-female_removed_minor,target:leggy,targetStage:3=smiling.png,Well, whatever you are, it's a fact you're super cute!
1-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=calm.png,Uh... I don't know that much about how ships are built, but I didn't understand a word of that. Maybe Franky, the shipwright of our ship, could. Though it might be too outlandish, even for him.
1-female_removed_minor,target:miko,targetStage:1=sad.png,Oh, y-you know her? I'm still shaking...
1-female_removed_minor,target:mythra,targetStage:2=greedy.png,Either way, I don't care. It looks valuable, that's all that matters.
1-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1=smiling.png,O-okay, you don't have to give me that much detail. I'm perfectly fine with it, but I think that's too much information.
1-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1=sad.png,Please ,don't curse me. I was just kidding earlier.
1-female_removed_minor,target:sakura,targetStage:3=shocked.png,Gahhh!!! A zombie! I didn't think I'd have to deal with them after Thriller Bark!
1-female_removed_minor,target:sakura,targetStage:4=furious.png,Why did you do that? You almost kill me! Just when I was okay with you being a zombie.
1-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=greedy.png,I bet it's a rare, expensive jewel. Don't worry, I'm not gonna steal it. I'll just admire it for a while...
1-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1=sad.png,When I see an airhead girl, my maternal instincts naturally kick in. I can't help it.
1-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=furious.png,Explosions now? Are you insane?


#lost bracelet
2-male_removing_minor=serious.png,I'm so bored...
2-male_removing_minor=thinking.png,Why is this game moving so slowly now?
2-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;ryuji&stage;0:=smiling.png,By any chance, that logo on your shirt isn't an emblem for some sort of organization, band, or... pirate crew, right?
2-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;dust&stage;5:=thinking.png,What wrong with taking off the hat? It only covers your face. And if I may say it, it's not very stylish.
2-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:6=sad.png,That cape is way too tacky for my taste, same as the glasses. I don't know why you saved it for last.
2-male_removed_minor=greedy.png,To entertain myself, I'm gonna think about all the stuff I'm gonna buy with the prize.
2-male_removed_minor=smiling.png,Maybe I should come up with a game to distract myself from the real game. Like counting the times ~player~ does something dumb.
2-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;dust&stage;6:=smiling.png,See? You're a lot cuter without the hat. Garchu!
2-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:7=serious.png,(I hope this guy never meets Luffy and the others. They'd get along immediately, and then annoy me to no end.)
2-female_removing_minor=smiling.png,It's so quiet here compared to the ship! It's feels nice for a change.
2-female_removing_minor=calm.png,I know this is my first time coming here, but I don't think I'm doing so bad.
2-female_removing_minor=smiling.png,Cute ~clothing~. But I bet it looks better when you're not wearing it.
2-female_removing_minor=happy.png,Alright, I have no complains.
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;6:=thinking.png,I completely forgot you have prosthetic legs. That's why you kept your socks on, huh?
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;haru&stage;2:=smiling.png,Is that sweater as comfortable as it looks? It's also super cute.
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;estelle&stage;1:=thinking.png,It's a big dress. There should be an easy way to take it off.
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;0:=thinking.png,Obsession with food is not good for you. At least Luffy doesn't get fat with all the meat that he eats.
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;mavis&stage;3:=smiling.png,So you like red and black, huh? I prefer lighter colors.
2-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;0:,count-role;self&saidmarker;target1:=smiling.png,You really like ~player~, don't you? (I should be careful trying to seduce ~player~ into losing with her here...)
2-female_removing_minor,target:caulifla,targetStage:2=sad.png,Oh, you can fly too? S-so what?
2-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:bee,targetNotSaidMarker:bee_stop,targetSayingMarker:bee2=shocked.png,Ah!!! A bee! Someone get it out of here!
2-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=thinking.png,I always thought I was young for a navigator, but you are even younger, Futaba. Though I have been drawing maps for as long as I can remember. But it's not a competition, right?
2-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3=calm.png,What's your crew like, Futaba? Since we have a few things in common, I'm guessing they might be a bunch of lovable morons too.
2-female_removing_minor,target:leggy,targetStage:2,id:8=thinking.png,You're shaving off our wool? I guess you really aren't a mink. They're very proud of their hair, after all.
2-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=thinking.png,I would like to see your ship. Judging by your outfit, it bet it has some interesting design for sailing.
2-female_removing_minor,target:miko,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Ah... G-g-g-g-ghoooost!!!
2-female_removing_minor,target:monika,targetStage:1=serious.png,(Her panties are showing again. Is she doing this on purpose to try to entice ~player~?)

2-female_removing_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1=serious.png,Still, I wouldn't wear an outfit like that. Not because I don't like it, but because I'm sure it would make the guys think I'm going to do all their chores for them.

2-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=smiling.png,Magic? Sure... But seriously, what is that thing?

2-female_removing_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=shocked.png,AH! What was that noise?!
2-female_removed_minor=serious.png,I hope Sanji and Brook aren't hiding somewhere, waiting for me to lose again.
2-female_removed_minor=thinking.png,The game is moving a little slow, isn't it?
2-female_removed_minor=calm.png,Isn't this a nice day? And it seems to get nicer the more I win.
2-female_removed_minor=annoyed.png,Normally I'd be glad there's not much control in this game, but who's going to make sure there aren't any cheaters playing?
2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;haru&stage;3:=thinking.png,Huh, so sweaters are good for concealing the size of your breasts... I should remember that the next time I need to avoid drawing attention to myself.
2-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;estelle&stage;2&sayingmarker;messy_c=6:=calm.png,What a mess. Too bad I don't have a hair brush to loan you right now.

3-female_removing_minor=embarrassed.png,Oh, your ~clothing~? For me? Ah, you're just taking it off.
3-female_removing_minor=thinking.png,I might have a similar ~clothing~ to yours. Or don't I?

3-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,count-phantom_thieves:1=smiling.png,Those names make them all sound so mysterious. I guess they're nicknames, since you're a group of thieves.
3-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,count-ryuji:1=smiling.png,Oh, then he would fit perfectly in my own crew. We have a bunch of tough headed goofballs... no offense, Skull.

3-female_removed_minor,target:emi,targetStage:7,id:62=smiling.png,You know, maybe Franky could make you some better legs. He's the shipwright of our crew, and like half of his body is machine. It would probably take him like five minutes.
3-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:bee2=serious.png,I get your reaction, Florina. I also hate bugs. Especially the ones that destroy your clothes.

#lost jeans
4-male_removing_minor=greedy.png,Your ~clothing~, huh? Is that where you keep your money by any chance?
4-male_removing_minor=greedy.png,Hmmm, I wonder if you could keep your wallet hidden inside your ~clothing~, by any chance.
4-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;ryuji&stage;0:=smiling.png,By any chance, that logo on your shirt isn't an emblem for some sort of organization, band, or... pirate crew, right?
4-male_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;dust&stage;5:=thinking.png,What wrong with taking off the hat? It only covers your face. And if I may say it, it's not very stylish.
4-male_removing_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:6=sad.png,That cape is way too tacky for my taste, same as the glasses. I don't know why you saved it for last.
4-male_removed_minor=smiling.png,I'm kidding, I'm kidding! I'm not here to steal. (Unless I lose the game...)
4-male_removed_minor=embarrassed.png,No, don't tell me. I'd rather guess.
4-male_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;dust&stage;6:=smiling.png,See? You're a lot cuter without the hat. Garchu!
4-male_removed_minor,target:kamina,targetStage:7=serious.png,(I hope this guy never meets Luffy and the others. They'd get along immediately, and then annoy me to no end.)
4-female_removing_minor=serious.png,Hmmm, that ~clothing~... Classic ~name~ move.
4-female_removing_minor=calm.png,Ha! I knew it. The ~clothing~ is coming off.
4-female_removing_minor=serious.png,I won't say I'm happy with this, but it makes sense.
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;emi&stage;6:=thinking.png,I completely forgot you have prosthetic legs. That's why you kept your socks on, huh?
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;haru&stage;2:=smiling.png,Is that sweater as comfortable as it looks? It's also super cute.
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;estelle&stage;1:=thinking.png,It's a big dress. There should be an easy way to take it off.
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;0:=thinking.png,Obsession with food is not good for you. At least Luffy doesn't get fat with all the meat that he eats.
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;mavis&stage;3:=smiling.png,So you like red and black, huh? I prefer lighter colors.
4-female_removing_minor,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;0:,count-role;self&saidmarker;target1:=smiling.png,You really like ~player~, don't you? (I should be careful trying to seduce ~player~ into losing with her here...)

4-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:bee,targetNotSaidMarker:bee_stop,targetSayingMarker:bee2=shocked.png,Ah!!! A bee! Someone get it out of here!
4-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:0=thinking.png,I always thought I was young for a navigator, but you are even younger, Futaba. Though I have been drawing maps for as long as I can remember. But it's not a competition, right?
4-female_removing_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:3=calm.png,What's your crew like, Futaba? Since we have a few things in common, I'm guessing they might be a bunch of lovable morons too.
4-female_removing_minor,target:leggy,targetStage:2,id:8=thinking.png,You're shaving off our wool? I guess you really aren't a mink. They're very proud of their hair, after all.
4-female_removing_minor,target:meia,targetStage:1=thinking.png,I would like to see your ship. Judging by your outfit, it bet it has some interesting design for sailing.
4-female_removing_minor,target:miko,targetStage:0=shocked.png,Ah... G-g-g-g-ghoooost!!!
4-female_removing_minor,target:monika,targetStage:1=serious.png,(Her panties are showing again. Is she doing this on purpose to try to entice ~player~?)

4-female_removing_minor,target:mythra,targetStage:1=serious.png,Do you keep a weapon or something there, or is it just for the look?
4-female_removing_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1=serious.png,Still, I wouldn't wear an outfit like that. Not because I don't like it, but because I'm sure it would make the guys think I'm going to do all their chores for them.
4-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0,id:54=calm.png,Oh, she's your wrestling partner? I see... What else do you two do together?

4-female_removing_minor,target:sakura,targetStage:2,id:2=serious.png,What's wrong, Sakura? Your skin... Is that a rare disease? I have a doctor in my crew, I'm sure he can help you...
4-female_removing_minor,target:sakura,targetStage:3,targetSayingMarker:headless,id:3=shocked.png,OH MY GOSH!!! HER HEAD...!!!
4-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=smiling.png,Magic? Sure... But seriously, what is that thing?
4-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:0=thinking.png,I just wanna make sure you know what you're getting into. You look like a nice girl, if maybe a little... lost.
4-female_removing_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=shocked.png,AH! What was that noise?!
4-female_removed_minor=calm.png,Even in my current position, I respect this. Girls need brains to survive, after all.
4-female_removed_minor=smiling.png,Game recognize game. But let's keep going.
4-female_removed_minor=calm.png,A most noble effort, fellow player. Let's continue.
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;haru&stage;3:=thinking.png,Huh, so sweaters are good for concealing the size of your breasts... I should remember that the next time I need to avoid drawing attention to myself.
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;estelle&stage;2&sayingmarker;messy_c=6:=calm.png,What a mess. Too bad I don't have a hair brush to loan you right now.
4-female_removed_minor,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;1:,id:77=sad.png,You could always buy new clothes that fit you better. But that's so painful...
4-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,count-ann:1=smiling.png,That sounds just like me! I guess every group of outlaws needs a big sister.
4-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,count-haru:1=smiling.png,Looks can be deceiving, alright! That's always part of the strategy.
4-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,count-hifumi:1=smiling.png,She sounds like Robin. Every team needs someone who can keep their composure in times of crisis.
4-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:4,count-joker:1=smiling.png,Hahah, he couldn't be more different from my captain! Still, I wouldn't replace Luffy for anyone.

-3-female_removed_minor=embarrassed.png,Aren't clothes the best? They make feel nice to wear, they give you style. They save you from being naked in front of others, like a weirdo...

-3-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=calm.png,Uh... I don't know that much about how ships are built, but I didn't understand a word of that. Maybe Franky, the shipwright of our ship, could. Though it might be too outlandish, even for him.

-1-female_removed_minor,target:futaba,targetStage:1=embarrassed.png,I'm 20. I know, I don't look a day over 18. It's strange that nobody asked my age at the entrance.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:leggy,targetStage:3=smiling.png,Well, whatever you are, it's a fact you're super cute!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=calm.png,Uh... I don't know that much about how ships are built, but I didn't understand a word of that. Maybe Franky, the shipwright of our ship, could. Though it might be too outlandish, even for him.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:miko,targetStage:1=sad.png,Oh, y-you know her? I'm still shaking...
-1-female_removed_minor,target:mythra,targetStage:2=greedy.png,Either way, I don't care. It looks valuable, that's all that matters.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:1=smiling.png,O-okay, you don't have to give me that much detail. I'm perfectly fine with it, but I think that's too much information.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1=sad.png,Please ,don't curse me. I was just kidding earlier.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sakura,targetStage:3=shocked.png,Gahhh!!! A zombie! I didn't think I'd have to deal with them after Thriller Bark!
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sakura,targetStage:4=furious.png,Why did you do that? You almost kill me! Just when I was okay with you being a zombie.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=greedy.png,I bet it's a rare, expensive jewel. Don't worry, I'm not gonna steal it. I'll just admire it for a while...
-1-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1=sad.png,When I see an airhead girl, my maternal instincts naturally kick in. I can't help it.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=furious.png,Explosions now? Are you insane?




#OPPONENT REMOVING MAJOR CLOTHING
#Major clothing reveals a significant amount of skin and likely underwear.
#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

#fully clothed
0-male_removing_major=smiling.png,Huh, I guess I underestimated you, ~name~.
0-male_removing_major=smiling.png,That's a fair choice, ~name~. Very fair.
0-male_removed_major=embarrassed.png,My, you're making me blush. If you strip again I don't know what I'll do.
0-male_removed_major=serious.png,I appreciate that you are playing the game right, but I hope you're not a guy that enjoys showing his body in front of strangers.
0-female_removing_major=happy.png,Yes! This is what I'm talking about!
0-female_removing_major=happy.png,Woohoo! Take it off!
0-female_removing_major=happy.png,Yay! The ~clothing~ is coming off!
0-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;3:=happy.png,If you want to lose weight, it's a good thing you haven't tasted Sanji's fries. They're <i>the best</i>!
0-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;2:,id:78=sad.png,Oh, boy... I hate when that happens.
0-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;1:,id:67=serious.png,What kind of trick are you pulling here?
0-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;misato&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,W-what? Your body?
0-female_removing_major,target:caulifla,targetStage:1,id:16=shocked.png,Ahhh! What's happening?!
0-female_removing_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:5=thinking.png,(I wonder if she's wearing panties underneath.)
0-female_removing_major,target:emi,targetStage:7=sad.png,But... you won't be able to stand up anymore. Should we get you a chair, or...?
0-female_removing_major,target:emi,targetStage:7=calm.png,No kidding. You really are a terrifying opponent in this game.
0-female_removing_major,target:futaba,targetStage:2=calm.png,Is that drawing on your shirt your crew's logo or something?
0-female_removing_major,target:hanako,targetStage:3=smiling.png,I think you're getting more confident, Hanako. You don't look scared to take off your shirt.
0-female_removing_major,target:hanako,targetStage:4=smiling.png,It's okay, Hanako. You're doing great.
0-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=shocked.png,Gah! The psycho woman is back.
0-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shocked.png,W-what's wrong? Are you gonna explode?
0-female_removing_major,target:misty_hgss,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Makes sense that you're wearing a jacket on top, or you wouldn't last very long in this game with just a swimsuit.
0-female_removing_major,target:mulan,targetStage:1=calm.png,What?
0-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5=smiling.png,Hey, that's a cute pair of underwear. Wait, are those... strawberries?
0-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:0=shocked.png,At least it's a friendly ball of light. Wait, how is it gonna strip?
0-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=shocked.png,Nayru! What...?!
0-female_removing_major,target:rarity_eg,targetStage:2=thinking.png,So how did you change clothes earlier? It must be a useful skill for a fashion designer.
0-female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2=sad.png,(I hope she doesn't have a demon head, or something...)
0-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=shocked.png,What the...?! This is like the transformation of the Germa 66 members.
0-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=shocked.png,Ah!!! Your uniform is alive! Is it a g-ghost?
0-female_removing_major,target:saki_zls,targetStage:5=serious.png,Your makeup? Come on, that's not enough. You have to remove your <i>clothes</i>.
0-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=furious.png,Enough with the explosions! They're freaking me out.
0-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=shocked.png,Down there now?!
0-female_removed_major=greedy.png,I can already see that prize in my hands.
0-female_removed_major=embarrassed.png,By the way, I'm not celebrating because I want to see you undress, I'm just happy to win. Sorry if I gave you the wrong idea, even if we're both girls.
0-female_removed_major=embarrassed.png,Oh, I guess I should be more supportive instead of celebrating in front of you. We women have to stand by each other.
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;2:=thinking.png,Huh, so your clothes disappeared... But what's the point of the book? Is it just for show?
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;4:=sad.png,Oh, for your own good I shouldn't have brought that up. Forget I said anything.
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;3:=calm.png,That wasn't funny. But if they split, they were too small for you anyway.
0-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;haru&stage;5&sayingmarker;mommyharu:,id:68=serious.png,What other side? What's with that look?
0-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,oneShotId:163=smiling.png,You got a nice figure, ~name~. I have to be careful to keep my own diet. Sanji's food is so good.
0-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,oneShotId:163=thinking.png,That's a nice body you have. Thanks to Luffy I couldn't get fat even if I tried. He's always stealing my food.
0-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,oneShotId:163=smiling.png,Nice figure. Do you exercise, ~name~? I don't, I guess I'm just lucky, heheh. Actually, I do go for a swim every now and then.
0-female_removed_major,filter:muscular,oneShotId:171=smiling.png,Those are some big muscles you have. I know they're not considered very feminine, but you are still beautiful.
0-female_removed_major,filter:muscular,oneShotId:171=smiling.png,Even with those muscles, you still have a distinct feminine figure. And you also look like a badass.
0-female_removed_major,filter:muscular,oneShotId:171=smiling.png,You have so many muscles, yet you're still beautiful. Maybe I could borrow some of Zoro's equipment and train my body a little.
0-female_removed_major,target:caulifla,targetStage:2=sad.png,So much light... I thought Kizaru showed up for a second, I almost had a heart attack.
0-female_removed_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:6=embarrassed.png,Those legs look even thicker when they're exposed... Oh, sorry Chun-Li. I didn't mean to say that out loud.
0-female_removed_major,target:futaba,targetStage:3=thinking.png,I see... Wearing a shirt with my crew's flag would be a terrible idea. Gosh, I hope Luffy doesn't get that idea.
0-female_removed_major,target:hanako,targetStage:4=sad.png,Oh, I thought the scars were only on your face. That must have hurt so much...
0-female_removed_major,target:hanako,targetStage:5=calm.png,Oh, I guess that would make you uncomfortable. But for what it's worth, I think you're beautiful.
0-female_removed_major,target:launch,targetStage:6=thinking.png,(No way I'm telling where the gun is. Wait, where is the gun?)
0-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=calm.png,Oh, hello. That's an interesting technology, even if it's a little flashy.
0-female_removed_major,target:mavis,targetStage:3=thinking.png,You're very pale, Mavis. A little sunlight wouldn't hurt you.
0-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=sad.png,Oh, that looks like it must've hurt. But it doesn't make you any less beautiful.
0-female_removed_major,target:misty_hgss,targetStage:1=calm.png,Even if you weren't wearing a swimsuit, it's easy to tell you have a swimmer's body.
0-female_removed_major,target:mulan,targetStage:2=serious.png,Huh?! You're actually a woman? That such a surprise, and... Bah, why pretend?
0-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5=thinking.png,This is just my opinion, but I think the oversized shirt is even more suggestive because it prolongs the mystery... Oh, but your panties are still visible, so it's no problem.
0-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:6=sad.png,Well, what's the problem if that underwear isn't very adult? They match your body. Eh... that didn't come out right.
0-female_removed_major,target:navi,targetStage:1,id:42=smiling.png,Oh, how cute! This look suits you much better.
0-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetSayingMarker:possess=sad.png,Are you OK? What the hell was that thing? It didn't look like anything I've seen.
0-female_removed_major,target:rarity_eg,targetStage:3=smiling.png,Too bad you're playing a strip poker game, there's not much you can do it with here.
0-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=smiling.png,Hey, you're cute! I mean, your face is normal...
0-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3=shocked.png,What is that drink? The color is a little suspicious...
0-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=embarrassed.png,Uh... That uniform is a little... lighter than I was expecting.
0-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:5=furious.png,First your friend shows up out of nowhere, then you transform, and now your clothes are alive? Do you want to give me a heart attack?
0-female_removed_major,target:saki_zls,targetStage:6,id:5=sad.png,You're doing it by dumping water on your head? Isn't that too much? Hey, your skin...
0-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:5=sad.png,You don't look very good, Sayori. I don't blame you, but I miss your enthusiasm from earlier.
0-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:dizzylose=sad.png,They're unsafe, and... Whoa, that's a skimpy bra.
0-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:6=sad.png,Should I call Chopper and ask him to stand by in case any of these explosions causes any real damage?

2-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=shocked.png,Ah!!! Your uniform is alive! Is it a g-ghost?
2-female_removing_major,target:saki_zls,targetStage:5=serious.png,Your makeup? Come on, that's not enough. You have to remove your <i>clothes</i>.
2-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=furious.png,Enough with the explosions! They're freaking me out.
2-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=shocked.png,Down there now?!
2-female_removed_major=smug.png,I have nothing to worry as long as I win this game. Oh, I wonder if I'm gonna win?
2-female_removed_major=smug.png,I'm suddenly filled with renewed confidence. Yes, I'm going to win this game. You should just accept it.
2-female_removed_major=smug.png,Even if I've lost a couple of times, at least it seems I'm doing better than ~name~.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;2:=thinking.png,Huh, so your clothes disappeared... But what's the point of the book? Is it just for show?
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;4:=sad.png,Oh, for your own good I shouldn't have brought that up. Forget I said anything.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;3:=calm.png,That wasn't funny. But if they split, they were too small for you anyway.
2-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;haru&stage;5&sayingmarker;mommyharu:,id:68=serious.png,What other side? What's with that look?
2-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,oneShotId:163=smiling.png,You got a nice figure, ~name~. I have to be careful to keep my own diet. Sanji's food is so good.
2-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,oneShotId:163=thinking.png,That's a nice body you have. Thanks to Luffy I couldn't get fat even if I tried. He's always stealing my food.
2-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,oneShotId:163=smiling.png,Nice figure. Do you exercise, ~name~? I don't, I guess I'm just lucky, heheh. Actually, I do go for a swim every now and then.
2-female_removed_major,filter:muscular,oneShotId:171=smiling.png,Those are some big muscles you have. I know they're not considered very feminine, but you are still beautiful.
2-female_removed_major,filter:muscular,oneShotId:171=smiling.png,Even with those muscles, you still have a distinct feminine figure. And you also look like a badass.
2-female_removed_major,filter:muscular,oneShotId:171=smiling.png,You have so many muscles, yet you're still beautiful. Maybe I could borrow some of Zoro's equipment and train my body a little.
2-female_removed_major,target:caulifla,targetStage:2=sad.png,So much light... I thought Kizaru showed up for a second, I almost had a heart attack.
2-female_removed_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:6=embarrassed.png,Those legs look even thicker when they're exposed... Oh, sorry Chun-Li. I didn't mean to say that out loud.
2-female_removed_major,target:futaba,targetStage:3=thinking.png,I see... Wearing a shirt with my crew's flag would be a terrible idea. Gosh, I hope Luffy doesn't get that idea.
2-female_removed_major,target:hanako,targetStage:4=sad.png,Oh, I thought the scars were only on your face. That must have hurt so much...
2-female_removed_major,target:hanako,targetStage:5=calm.png,Oh, I guess that would make you uncomfortable. But for what it's worth, I think you're beautiful.
2-female_removed_major,target:launch,targetStage:6=thinking.png,(No way I'm telling where the gun is. Wait, where is the gun?)
2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=calm.png,Oh, hello. That's an interesting technology, even if it's a little flashy.
2-female_removed_major,target:mavis,targetStage:3=thinking.png,You're very pale, Mavis. A little sunlight wouldn't hurt you.
2-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=sad.png,Oh, that looks like it must've hurt. But it doesn't make you any less beautiful.
2-female_removed_major,target:misty_hgss,targetStage:1=calm.png,Even if you weren't wearing a swimsuit, it's easy to tell you have a swimmer's body.
2-female_removed_major,target:mulan,targetStage:2=serious.png,Huh?! You're actually a woman? That such a surprise, and... Bah, why pretend?
2-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5=thinking.png,This is just my opinion, but I think the oversized shirt is even more suggestive because it prolongs the mystery... Oh, but your panties are still visible, so it's no problem.
2-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:6=sad.png,Well, what's the problem if that underwear isn't very adult? They match your body. Eh... that didn't come out right.
2-female_removed_major,target:navi,targetStage:1,id:42=smiling.png,Oh, how cute! This look suits you much better.
2-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetSayingMarker:possess=sad.png,Are you OK? What the hell was that thing? It didn't look like anything I've seen.
2-female_removed_major,target:rarity_eg,targetStage:3=smiling.png,Too bad you're playing a strip poker game, there's not much you can do it with here.
2-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=smiling.png,Hey, you're cute! I mean, your face is normal...
2-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3=shocked.png,What is that drink? The color is a little suspicious...
2-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=embarrassed.png,Uh... That uniform is a little... lighter than I was expecting.
2-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:5=furious.png,First your friend shows up out of nowhere, then you transform, and now your clothes are alive? Do you want to give me a heart attack?
2-female_removed_major,target:saki_zls,targetStage:6,id:5=sad.png,You're doing it by dumping water on your head? Isn't that too much? Hey, your skin...
2-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:5=sad.png,You don't look very good, Sayori. I don't blame you, but I miss your enthusiasm from earlier.
2-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:dizzylose=sad.png,They're unsafe, and... Whoa, that's a skimpy bra.
2-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:6=sad.png,Should I call Chopper and ask him to stand by in case any of these explosions causes any real damage?

3-male_removing_major=smiling.png,Oh, look who's one big step closer to being naked.
3-male_removed_major=smug.png,Are you worried yet, ~name~? Maybe you're not doing so well.
3-male_removed_major=smug.png,Maybe this is the most undressed you'll be, ~name~. But don't count on me helping you with that.
3-female_removing_major=happy.png,Hee hee hee, there it is! The proof that I'm making progress!
3-female_removing_major=happy.png,Oh, yeah! I keep moving forward.
3-female_removing_major=greedy.png,I'm gonna win! I'm more certain than ever before!

3-female_removing_major,target:hanako,targetStage:4=smiling.png,It's okay, Hanako. You're doing great.
3-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=shocked.png,Gah! The psycho woman is back.

3-female_removing_major,target:misty_hgss,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Makes sense that you're wearing a jacket on top, or you wouldn't last very long in this game with just a swimsuit.
3-female_removing_major,target:mulan,targetStage:1=calm.png,What?
3-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5=smiling.png,Hey, that's a cute pair of underwear. Wait, are those... strawberries?

3-female_removing_major,target:rarity_eg,targetStage:2=thinking.png,So how did you change clothes earlier? It must be a useful skill for a fashion designer.

3-female_removed_major=smiling.png,Are you sure you're aren't enjoying losing even a little, ~name~? You won't fool me.
3-female_removed_major=thinking.png,If you're worried about losing soon, I could sell you my pants to wear. Oh, that's not allowed? Never mind, then.
3-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;2:=thinking.png,Huh, so your clothes disappeared... But what's the point of the book? Is it just for show?

5-male_removing_major=serious.png,Your ~clothing~, huh? I see you want to die...
5-male_removing_major=serious.png,Oh, so it's your ~clothing~. I know who I'm zapping first with my Clima-Tact after the game ends.
5-male_removed_major=smiling.png,Just kidding! That's actually a nice choice. Isn't it amazing that I still have my sense of humor?
5-male_removed_major=smiling.png,It's a joke. I'm just happy because this is good for me.
5-female_removing_major=smiling.png,Oh, nice. I guess you taking off your ~clothing~ can't be a bad sign for me.
5-female_removing_major=smiling.png,Oh, look. Miss ~name~ is relinquishing some of her modesty.
5-female_removing_major=smiling.png,Haha. Now it's your turn to show some skin.

5-female_removing_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:5=thinking.png,(I wonder if she's wearing panties underneath.)
5-female_removing_major,target:emi,targetStage:7=sad.png,But... you won't be able to stand up anymore. Should we get you a chair, or...?
5-female_removing_major,target:emi,targetStage:7=calm.png,No kidding. You really are a terrifying opponent in this game.

5-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=shocked.png,What the...?! This is like the transformation of the Germa 66 members.

5-female_removed_major=serious.png,Unless you want me to lower my guard. Nice try, Missy! I won't fall for that.
5-female_removed_major=happy.png,And while you are too embarrassed to focus on the game, I'll swoop in and claim victory. Never mind that I'm already... half naked.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;2:=thinking.png,Huh, so your clothes disappeared... But what's the point of the book? Is it just for show?
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;4:=sad.png,Oh, for your own good I shouldn't have brought that up. Forget I said anything.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;3:=calm.png,That wasn't funny. But if they split, they were too small for you anyway.
5-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;haru&stage;5&sayingmarker;mommyharu:,id:68=serious.png,What other side? What's with that look?
5-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,oneShotId:163=smiling.png,You got a nice figure, ~name~. I have to be careful to keep my own diet. Sanji's food is so good.
5-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,oneShotId:163=thinking.png,That's a nice body you have. Thanks to Luffy I couldn't get fat even if I tried. He's always stealing my food.
5-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,oneShotId:163=smiling.png,Nice figure. Do you exercise, ~name~? I don't, I guess I'm just lucky, heheh. Actually, I do go for a swim every now and then.
5-female_removed_major,filter:muscular,oneShotId:171=smiling.png,Those are some big muscles you have. I know they're not considered very feminine, but you are still beautiful.
5-female_removed_major,filter:muscular,oneShotId:171=smiling.png,Even with those muscles, you still have a distinct feminine figure. And you also look like a badass.
5-female_removed_major,filter:muscular,oneShotId:171=smiling.png,You have so many muscles, yet you're still beautiful. Maybe I could borrow some of Zoro's equipment and train my body a little.
5-female_removed_major,target:caulifla,targetStage:2=sad.png,So much light... I thought Kizaru showed up for a second, I almost had a heart attack.
5-female_removed_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:6=embarrassed.png,Those legs look even thicker when they're exposed... Oh, sorry Chun-Li. I didn't mean to say that out loud.
5-female_removed_major,target:futaba,targetStage:3=thinking.png,I see... Wearing a shirt with my crew's flag would be a terrible idea. Gosh, I hope Luffy doesn't get that idea.
5-female_removed_major,target:hanako,targetStage:4=sad.png,Oh, I thought the scars were only on your face. That must have hurt so much...
5-female_removed_major,target:hanako,targetStage:5=calm.png,Oh, I guess that would make you uncomfortable. But for what it's worth, I think you're beautiful.
5-female_removed_major,target:launch,targetStage:6=thinking.png,(No way I'm telling where the gun is. Wait, where is the gun?)
5-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=calm.png,Oh, hello. That's an interesting technology, even if it's a little flashy.
5-female_removed_major,target:mavis,targetStage:3=thinking.png,You're very pale, Mavis. A little sunlight wouldn't hurt you.
5-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=sad.png,Oh, that looks like it must've hurt. But it doesn't make you any less beautiful.
5-female_removed_major,target:misty_hgss,targetStage:1=calm.png,Even if you weren't wearing a swimsuit, it's easy to tell you have a swimmer's body.
5-female_removed_major,target:mulan,targetStage:2=serious.png,Huh?! You're actually a woman? That such a surprise, and... Bah, why pretend?
5-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5=thinking.png,This is just my opinion, but I think the oversized shirt is even more suggestive because it prolongs the mystery... Oh, but your panties are still visible, so it's no problem.
5-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:6=sad.png,Well, what's the problem if that underwear isn't very adult? They match your body. Eh... that didn't come out right.
5-female_removed_major,target:navi,targetStage:1,id:42=smiling.png,Oh, how cute! This look suits you much better.
5-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetSayingMarker:possess=sad.png,Are you OK? What the hell was that thing? It didn't look like anything I've seen.
5-female_removed_major,target:rarity_eg,targetStage:3=smiling.png,Too bad you're playing a strip poker game, there's not much you can do it with here.
5-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=smiling.png,Hey, you're cute! I mean, your face is normal...
5-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3=shocked.png,What is that drink? The color is a little suspicious...
5-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=embarrassed.png,Uh... That uniform is a little... lighter than I was expecting.
5-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:5=furious.png,First your friend shows up out of nowhere, then you transform, and now your clothes are alive? Do you want to give me a heart attack?
5-female_removed_major,target:saki_zls,targetStage:6,id:5=sad.png,You're doing it by dumping water on your head? Isn't that too much? Hey, your skin...
5-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:5=sad.png,You don't look very good, Sayori. I don't blame you, but I miss your enthusiasm from earlier.

-3-male_removing_major=smug.png,Didn't you enjoy seeing me lose all my clothes? Now I'm gonna do the same.

-2-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,oneShotId:163=thinking.png,That's a nice body you have. Thanks to Luffy I couldn't get fat even if I tried. He's always stealing my food.
-2-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,oneShotId:163=smiling.png,Nice figure. Do you exercise, ~name~? I don't, I guess I'm just lucky, heheh. Actually, I do go for a swim every now and then.
-2-female_removed_major,filter:muscular,oneShotId:171=smiling.png,Those are some big muscles you have. I know they're not considered very feminine, but you are still beautiful.
-2-female_removed_major,filter:muscular,oneShotId:171=smiling.png,Even with those muscles, you still have a distinct feminine figure. And you also look like a badass.
-2-female_removed_major,filter:muscular,oneShotId:171=smiling.png,You have so many muscles, yet you're still beautiful. Maybe I could borrow some of Zoro's equipment and train my body a little.
-2-female_removed_major,target:caulifla,targetStage:2=sad.png,So much light... I thought Kizaru showed up for a second, I almost had a heart attack.
-2-female_removed_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:6=embarrassed.png,Those legs look even thicker when they're exposed... Oh, sorry Chun-Li. I didn't mean to say that out loud.
-2-female_removed_major,target:futaba,targetStage:3=thinking.png,I see... Wearing a shirt with my crew's flag would be a terrible idea. Gosh, I hope Luffy doesn't get that idea.
-2-female_removed_major,target:hanako,targetStage:4=sad.png,Oh, I thought the scars were only on your face. That must have hurt so much...
-2-female_removed_major,target:hanako,targetStage:5=calm.png,Oh, I guess that would make you uncomfortable. But for what it's worth, I think you're beautiful.
-2-female_removed_major,target:launch,targetStage:6=thinking.png,(No way I'm telling where the gun is. Wait, where is the gun?)
-2-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2=calm.png,Oh, hello. That's an interesting technology, even if it's a little flashy.
-2-female_removed_major,target:mavis,targetStage:3=thinking.png,You're very pale, Mavis. A little sunlight wouldn't hurt you.
-2-female_removed_major,target:misato,targetStage:4=sad.png,Oh, that looks like it must've hurt. But it doesn't make you any less beautiful.
-2-female_removed_major,target:misty_hgss,targetStage:1=calm.png,Even if you weren't wearing a swimsuit, it's easy to tell you have a swimmer's body.
-2-female_removed_major,target:mulan,targetStage:2=serious.png,Huh?! You're actually a woman? That such a surprise, and... Bah, why pretend?
-2-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5=thinking.png,This is just my opinion, but I think the oversized shirt is even more suggestive because it prolongs the mystery... Oh, but your panties are still visible, so it's no problem.
-2-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:6=sad.png,Well, what's the problem if that underwear isn't very adult? They match your body. Eh... that didn't come out right.
-2-female_removed_major,target:navi,targetStage:1,id:42=smiling.png,Oh, how cute! This look suits you much better.
-2-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetSayingMarker:possess=sad.png,Are you OK? What the hell was that thing? It didn't look like anything I've seen.
-2-female_removed_major,target:rarity_eg,targetStage:3=smiling.png,Too bad you're playing a strip poker game, there's not much you can do it with here.
-2-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=smiling.png,Hey, you're cute! I mean, your face is normal...
-2-female_removed_major,target:remilia,targetStage:3=shocked.png,What is that drink? The color is a little suspicious...
-2-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=embarrassed.png,Uh... That uniform is a little... lighter than I was expecting.
-2-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:5=furious.png,First your friend shows up out of nowhere, then you transform, and now your clothes are alive? Do you want to give me a heart attack?
-2-female_removed_major,target:saki_zls,targetStage:6,id:5=sad.png,You're doing it by dumping water on your head? Isn't that too much? Hey, your skin...
-2-female_removed_major,target:sayori,targetStage:5=sad.png,You don't look very good, Sayori. I don't blame you, but I miss your enthusiasm from earlier.
-2-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:dizzylose=sad.png,They're unsafe, and... Whoa, that's a skimpy bra.
-2-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:6=sad.png,Should I call Chopper and ask him to stand by in case any of these explosions causes any real damage?


#finished
-1-male_removing_major=smiling.png,The ~clothing~ it is, then. Let's see what you have to offer.
-1-male_removing_major=smiling.png,Oh, that's what you're taking off, huh? You don't mind if I look, do you?
-1-male_removed_major=embarrassed.png,What? It's not like there's much to do now that I'm out of the game.
-1-male_removed_major=embarrassed.png,Why? Because I'm... intrigued. In a mostly intellectual way.
-1-female_removing_major=happy.png,Your ~clothing~, huh? Don't give up, ~name~! You can still win.
-1-female_removing_major=happy.png,You go, girl! Even if you lost this one, you can still win everything.
-1-female_removing_major=calm.png,You're my favorite to win, ~name~. Just don't tell anybody.
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;3:=happy.png,If you want to lose weight, it's a good thing you haven't tasted Sanji's fries. They're <i>the best</i>!
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;2:,id:78=sad.png,Oh, boy... I hate when that happens.
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;1:,id:67=serious.png,What kind of trick are you pulling here?
-1-female_removing_major,count-role;target&character;misato&stage;3:=embarrassed.png,W-what? Your body?
-1-female_removing_major,target:caulifla,targetStage:1,id:16=shocked.png,Ahhh! What's happening?!
-1-female_removing_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:5=thinking.png,(I wonder if she's wearing panties underneath.)
-1-female_removing_major,target:emi,targetStage:7=sad.png,But... you won't be able to stand up anymore. Should we get you a chair, or...?
-1-female_removing_major,target:emi,targetStage:7=calm.png,No kidding. You really are a terrifying opponent in this game.
-1-female_removing_major,target:futaba,targetStage:2=calm.png,Is that drawing on your shirt your crew's logo or something?
-1-female_removing_major,target:hanako,targetStage:3=smiling.png,I think you're getting more confident, Hanako. You don't look scared to take off your shirt.
-1-female_removing_major,target:hanako,targetStage:4=smiling.png,It's okay, Hanako. You're doing great.
-1-female_removing_major,target:launch,targetStage:5=shocked.png,Gah! The psycho woman is back.
-1-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:1=shocked.png,W-what's wrong? Are you gonna explode?
-1-female_removing_major,target:misty_hgss,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Makes sense that you're wearing a jacket on top, or you wouldn't last very long in this game with just a swimsuit.
-1-female_removing_major,target:mulan,targetStage:1=calm.png,What?
-1-female_removing_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5=smiling.png,Hey, that's a cute pair of underwear. Wait, are those... strawberries?
-1-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:0=shocked.png,At least it's a friendly ball of light. Wait, how is it gonna strip?
-1-female_removing_major,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=shocked.png,Nayru! What...?!
-1-female_removing_major,target:rarity_eg,targetStage:2=thinking.png,So how did you change clothes earlier? It must be a useful skill for a fashion designer.
-1-female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2=sad.png,(I hope she doesn't have a demon head, or something...)
-1-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=shocked.png,What the...?! This is like the transformation of the Germa 66 members.
-1-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=shocked.png,Ah!!! Your uniform is alive! Is it a g-ghost?
-1-female_removing_major,target:saki_zls,targetStage:5=serious.png,Your makeup? Come on, that's not enough. You have to remove your <i>clothes</i>.
-1-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=furious.png,Enough with the explosions! They're freaking me out.
-1-female_removing_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=shocked.png,Down there now?!
-1-female_removed_major=thinking.png,But, ummm, even if you win, remember that some victories are more spiritual than material...
-1-female_removed_major=embarrassed.png,And so what if you win the game, but take nothing home? Is that really what this game is all about in the end?
-1-female_removed_major=smiling.png,Although, in the end, what do you think you'll remember about this game? That you had a good time, or that you didn't win anything?
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;tharja&stage;2:=thinking.png,Huh, so your clothes disappeared... But what's the point of the book? Is it just for show?
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;4:=sad.png,Oh, for your own good I shouldn't have brought that up. Forget I said anything.
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;erufuda&stage;3:=calm.png,That wasn't funny. But if they split, they were too small for you anyway.
-1-female_removed_major,count-role;target&character;haru&stage;5&sayingmarker;mommyharu:,id:68=serious.png,What other side? What's with that look?
-1-female_removed_major,filter:athletic,oneShotId:163=smiling.png,You got a nice figure, ~name~. I have to be careful to keep my own diet. Sanji's food is so good.

male_chest_will_be_visible=calm.png,Come on, ~name~. Aren't you a man? It's just your chest.
male_crotch_will_be_visible=sad.png,I guess this isn't only hard for women after all. Can you do it, ~name~?
male_crotch_will_be_visible=sad.png,I thought this was hard enough for women, but with men there's also the unavoidable question of <i>how big it is.</i>
male_small_crotch_is_visible=sad.png,W-well, this isn't something to cry about. I'm sure you have tons of other great qualities.
male_small_crotch_is_visible=thinking.png,I'm sure lots of men have that same size. Probably...
male_medium_crotch_is_visible=embarrassed.png,Eh... I don't want to say anything to humiliate you any further. And you can still lose even more, so...
male_medium_crotch_is_visible=serious.png,H-hey, don't point that at me, mister. We just met each other.
male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,That thing is huge!
male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,That big?! Is this a joke?
male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,Is that a Sea King? No, it's...
female_chest_will_be_visible=sad.png,I did warn you it would come to this, didn't I? Oh, I didn't?
female_chest_will_be_visible=sad.png,Uff, if only you'd played better, ~name~...
female_small_chest_is_visible=calm.png,I could tell you that large breasts are overrated, but I don't think I'm the right person for that.
female_small_chest_is_visible=smiling.png,I bet you can lie on your stomach without feeling uncomfortable. I can't...
female_medium_chest_is_visible=calm.png,Hey, you look good. Even if they're not that big, they suit you just fine.
female_medium_chest_is_visible=calm.png,The perfect middle point. Right, ~name~?
female_crotch_will_be_visible=smiling.png,Y-you know, maybe you can still quit. I take no enjoyment in beating people, I just want the prize.
female_crotch_will_be_visible=sad.png,Come on, everyone! Do we really want to force ~name~ to do this?
female_crotch_is_visible=sad.png,This isn't the right setting for a woman to be seen like this.

0-male_chest_will_be_visible=smug.png,Show your chest. No need to make a fuss over this, pal.
0-male_chest_is_visible=smiling.png,Sorry that this doesn't get a reaction out of me. I spend every day with a bunch of shirtless men, this is nothing new for me.
0-male_chest_is_visible=serious.png,I've seen so many bare chested men nothing can surprise me.
0-male_chest_is_visible,oneShotId:160,priority:1=thinking.png,You don't have any scars on your chest like Luffy and Zoro. Not as big as those, at least.
0-male_chest_is_visible,oneShotId:160,priority:1=calm.png,I'm so used to seeing men with scars on their chest that yours seems unnatural to me.
0-male_chest_is_visible,oneShotId:160,priority:1=smiling.png,No big scars, huh? I guess you're not a man that's always seeking out trouble.
0-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;dust:,id:90=calm.png,Only a Mink would have chest hair like that... Or a very hairy man.
0-male_chest_is_visible,filter:chubby,oneShotId:196=thinking.png,You've <i>kinda</i> let yourself go, ~name~. Well, it's your business. Maybe you just enjoy food way too much.
0-male_chest_is_visible,filter:chubby,oneShotId:196=thinking.png,Exercising a little wouldn't kill you, you know? Sorry,I guess it's none of my business.
0-male_chest_is_visible,filter:chubby,oneShotId:196=calm.png,You sure got a tummy, ~name~. Although that's nothing compared to Luffy right after he eats.
0-male_chest_is_visible,filter:muscular,oneShotId:195=smug.png,I see you take your body seriously. Are those muscles supposed to be intimidating? I don't rely on strength to fight.
0-male_chest_is_visible,filter:muscular,oneShotId:195=thinking.png,You must train on a daily basis to have muscles like that. Still, I've seen better.
0-male_chest_is_visible,filter:muscular,oneShotId:195=thinking.png,You probably train a lot to have a body like that. Probably as much as Zoro. Everytime he's not sleeping, he's training.
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible=shocked.png,Are you really going to show it? What's with this place?
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible=smiling.png,If we got to this point before I've lost once, it means I'm doing something right!
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kamina=thinking.png,You're dropping your underwear now? I should be surprised, but considering how eccentric you are...
0-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=calm.png,Come on, Pit. I'm sure you're braver than you look.
0-male_small_crotch_is_visible=sad.png,Oh... You're probably nervous because I still have all my clothes, right? (It's so small...)
0-male_small_crotch_is_visible=sad.png,Are you feeling intimidated, or something?

0-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=smiling.png,Oh, so sky men are not different from regular men <i>down there</i>. I've always been curious, but that's not the kind of thing you can just ask.
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,I knew it! You're enjoying this, aren't you?
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible=serious.png,Hgg... I think you're enjoying this way too much, ~name~.
0-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:kamina=embarrassed.png,If I'm blushing, it's not because of your nudity. I just find you annoying...
0-female_chest_will_be_visible=serious.png,I'm really not on board with women being forced to remove their clothes, even if it's a punishment for losing in this game.

0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sakura,id:4=serious.png,Hey! You should treat your underwear with more care. If you lose it, a pervert might steal it.
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sayaka,targetStage:3=thinking.png,I'm not sure I'd wear a bra under a corset, but that's up to you.

0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=shocked.png,Wait! That bra is too small for this!
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=shocked.png,Now your bra, huh? Is this really just for comfort, or are people in your kingdom not used to wearing underwear?
0-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:weiss_schnee,targetSayingMarker:weiss_attempts_bribery=greedy.png,Yes! I accept! You can leave with my clothes too, depending on how much you're willing to pay...

0-female_small_chest_is_visible=thinking.png,Those are very small. How old are you, again?
0-female_small_chest_is_visible=smiling.png,What does it matter that they're small? You're still a cutie.

0-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:ribbon_girl=thinking.png,I can't say I get it... In my experience, masked fighters is the kind of stuff guys are into.

1-male_chest_is_visible=seductive.png,I'm only wearing this thin top from the waist up. But go on, expose your chest.
1-male_chest_is_visible,oneShotId:160,priority:1=thinking.png,You don't have any scars on your chest like Luffy and Zoro. Not as big as those, at least.
1-male_chest_is_visible,oneShotId:160,priority:1=calm.png,I'm so used to seeing men with scars on their chest that yours seems unnatural to me.
1-male_chest_is_visible,oneShotId:160,priority:1=smiling.png,No big scars, huh? I guess you're not a man that's always seeking out trouble.

1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:misty_hgss=calm.png,Oh, you're removing only the top half of your swimsuit. I guess that makes sense, since it's covering all your <i>valuable</i> parts.

1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;syrenne:=smiling.png,You should drink sake. I'll even join you, but after the game. I need to keep my head clear.

1-female_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:97,count-hairy&role;target:=calm.png,Wow, if I had hair like that there's no way I could wear a bikini.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:97,count-hairy&role;target:=smiling.png,I see you're a... free spirit, ~name~.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:97,count-hairy&role;target:=thinking.png,Hmmm, that's way more hair than I'd be comfortable with. Do I care too much about stuff like that?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:98,count-shaved&role;target:=embarrassed.png,I, uhh... always leave a little hair when I shave. I don't know why.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:98,count-shaved&role;target:=calm.png,What do you use for shaving, ~name~? Oh, sorry. We can talk about this later.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:98,count-shaved&role;target:=thinking.png,So you take care of your personal appearance. But do you do it for yourself?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:181=serious.png,You're even more of a pervert than Franky.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:181=serious.png,Not even Franky is this set on showing off.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=thinking.png,What can you do? You lost all your clothes.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=sad.png,These Devil Fruit users always think they can do whatever they want, even in a poker game.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy_white=sad.png,What? No, I would never... That sucks.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy_white,targetSaidMarker:chunli_help,alsoPlaying:chun-li,id:32=sad.png,Well, friends forgive each other. I'd forgive Robin if she did that to me, though I doubt she'd make that mistake.

1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri,targetSaidMarker:mika_lifting,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,id:35=smiling.png,She probably won't thank you, but at least it looks like she won't try to kill you.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kizuna=sad.png,Okay, that's a relief. I was a little worried considering you didn't even know what you have down there.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika,targetSaidMarker:cammy_help,alsoPlaying:cammy_white,id:57=sad.png,Is Cammy turning a little blue? I've seen Luffy look like that when I grab his neck, I don't think it's a good thing.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rarity_eg=smiling.png,Even if you get naked, at least your hair is still very much in style.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,targetStage:4=shocked.png,There's nothing wrong with that! I didn't mean to stare.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ryuko=smiling.png,I understand the importance of shaving if you have to wear that skimpy uniform.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shimakaze=sad.png,Phew, it's over. Now you're naked. No more explosions, hopefully.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=sad.png,I've been called indecent before, but I still wouldn't wear a skirt without panties underneath. Not on purpose, at least.

2-male_chest_will_be_visible=smiling.png,Oh, so you're going to expose your chest? Don't let me stop you.
2-male_chest_is_visible=seductive.png,You're not giving up yet, are you? Come and get me, then!
2-male_chest_is_visible,oneShotId:160,priority:1=thinking.png,You don't have any scars on your chest like Luffy and Zoro. Not as big as those, at least.
2-male_chest_is_visible,oneShotId:160,priority:1=calm.png,I'm so used to seeing men with scars on their chest that yours seems unnatural to me.
2-male_chest_is_visible,oneShotId:160,priority:1=smiling.png,No big scars, huh? I guess you're not a man that's always seeking out trouble.
2-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;dust:,id:90=calm.png,Only a Mink would have chest hair like that... Or a very hairy man.
2-male_chest_is_visible,filter:chubby,oneShotId:196=thinking.png,You've <i>kinda</i> let yourself go, ~name~. Well, it's your business. Maybe you just enjoy food way too much.
2-male_chest_is_visible,filter:chubby,oneShotId:196=thinking.png,Exercising a little wouldn't kill you, you know? Sorry,I guess it's none of my business.
2-male_chest_is_visible,filter:chubby,oneShotId:196=calm.png,You sure got a tummy, ~name~. Although that's nothing compared to Luffy right after he eats.
2-male_chest_is_visible,filter:muscular,oneShotId:195=smug.png,I see you take your body seriously. Are those muscles supposed to be intimidating? I don't rely on strength to fight.
2-male_chest_is_visible,filter:muscular,oneShotId:195=thinking.png,You must train on a daily basis to have muscles like that. Still, I've seen better.
2-male_chest_is_visible,filter:muscular,oneShotId:195=thinking.png,You probably train a lot to have a body like that. Probably as much as Zoro. Everytime he's not sleeping, he's training.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible=serious.png,Go ahead. I just hope you're not a pervert who enjoys exposing himself, like Franky.
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible=serious.png,You're not going to enjoy exposing your parts to us, huh?
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kamina=thinking.png,You're dropping your underwear now? I should be surprised, but considering how eccentric you are...
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=calm.png,Come on, Pit. I'm sure you're braver than you look.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ryuji:=smiling.png,Heh, I had a feeling you weren't actually a blonde. You didn't act like one.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=smiling.png,Oh, so sky men are not different from regular men <i>down there</i>. I've always been curious, but that's not the kind of thing you can just ask.
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:kamina=embarrassed.png,If I'm blushing, it's not because of your nudity. I just find you annoying...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,filter:kind,oneShotId:165=sad.png,If you were a bad person, I wouldn't care much about you going through this, but it's ~name~.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,filter:kind,oneShotId:165=sad.png,I would be 100% on board with winning in this game if only the bad people lost. But with ~name~...? Not so much.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,filter:kind,oneShotId:165=sad.png,I'm sorry, ~name~. I mean it, you're a good girl and this doesn't bring me any pleasure.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=furious.png,Only some of the flowers? Remove them all!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:cammy_white,id:30=thinking.png,(For being so short, she has a nice butt. If maybe a little big.)

2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee2,targetSayingMarker:bee3=shocked.png,That bee came back?! That's it, I'm leaving!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kizuna=serious.png,Your bra already? Are you <i>trying</i> to get naked?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=shocked.png,Huh? Where did your clothes go? Wait, you <i>were</i> wearing a breastplate, weren't you?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:misty_hgss=calm.png,Oh, you're removing only the top half of your swimsuit. I guess that makes sense, since it's covering all your <i>valuable</i> parts.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ribbon_girl=serious.png,You're gonna expose your breasts already? Why don't you take off your mask? That's a mask, right?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:saki_zls,id:7=shocked.png,WAAAHH!! GET ME OUT OF HERE!!!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sakura,id:4=serious.png,Hey! You should treat your underwear with more care. If you lose it, a pervert might steal it.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sayaka,targetStage:3=thinking.png,I'm not sure I'd wear a bra under a corset, but that's up to you.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena=shocked.png,W-what is thaaat?!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=shocked.png,Wait! That bra is too small for this!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=shocked.png,Now your bra, huh? Is this really just for comfort, or are people in your kingdom not used to wearing underwear?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:weiss_schnee,targetSayingMarker:weiss_attempts_bribery=greedy.png,Yes! I accept! You can leave with my clothes too, depending on how much you're willing to pay...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2=smiling.png,You come on pretty strong for being so small. It's would be funny if it wasn't clear you really mean it.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba=embarrassed.png,I suppose we're not related after all... I didn't say anything.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:kizuna=thinking.png,Why wouldn't you have nipples? ...On second thought, forget I asked.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:ribbon_girl=thinking.png,I can't say I get it... In my experience, masked fighters is the kind of stuff guys are into.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:saki_zls=furious.png,W-w-what is with you? Is it too much to ask for a zombie to stay in one piece?
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:shimakaze=thinking.png,How are you doing this? Did you eat a Devil Fruit that allows you to explode your own clothes, or something? Although that would be a very useless ability.
2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:weiss_schnee,targetSaidMarker:weiss_attempts_bribery=furious.png,Why did no one else take the money?! What's wrong with you people that you'd rather see a topless girl than be rich? Perverts!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=serious.png,What kind of language is that?
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=serious.png,That's two more rounds you're playing after getting naked.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:cammy_white,targetSaidMarker:juri_help,alsoPlaying:juri,alsoPlayingStage:0,id:33=furious.png,Punch her, Cammy! Maybe I should punch her too...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee3,targetSayingMarker:exposed_chest=sad.png,You killed it? Now I feel bad, I just wanted it to go away. After all, it was just a bee, not a spider.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=serious.png,Hopefully, you can't do that to <i>our</i> clothes. You look like you might enjoy that.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:misty_hgss=smiling.png,That's not the <i>One Piece</i> Luffy is after... Heh, sorry that's a stupid joke, but I had to say it.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,id:47=shocked.png,Oh... At least we have one thing in common, Sayaka.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=thinking.png,Even if you still have clothes, we've already seen everything you have under. There are no more mysteries here.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan,targetStage:3=thinking.png,Now that I know you better, I'm not surprised you don't wear a bra, but that you still wear panties.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,id:22=shocked.png,Huh? (What kind of move is that?)
2-female_large_chest_is_visible=smiling.png,Large breasts are such a pain sometimes, am I right? I still wouldn't change mine.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible=calm.png,Isn't it annoying when your breasts bounce every time you move even a little fast because of how big they are? Well, maybe it's not so bad.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:chun-li,targetSaidMarker:juri_attack,alsoPlaying:juri,alsoPlayingStage:4,id:22=shocked.png,Huh? (What kind of move is that?)
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:chun-li,targetSaidMarker:juri_attack,alsoPlaying:juri,alsoPlayingStage:6,id:22=shocked.png,Huh? (What kind of move is that?)
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:nugi-chan=shocked.png,What's wrong with your nipples?! Oh, you have band aids over them... Sorry, I didn't see it right.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:sheena=sad.png,Tell me there aren't really spirits... It was just an illusion, right? I need to be able to sleep tonight.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie:=smug.png,(Did she forget she still has her necklace and stockings? Well, I'm not going to remind her.)
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;0:=shocked.png,Hey, what are you doing?! Even I know that isn't how a princess should act.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;misty_hgss:=smiling.png,My, you're very confident in your own body, Misty. I mean, why wouldn't you be? All that swimming makes you look amazing.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=smiling.png,You're not going to run away, are you?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=calm.png,Finally, no more flowers.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:cammy_white,id:29=shocked.png,Oh, I wasn't expecting that...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:cammy_white,targetSaidMarker:chunli_help,alsoPlaying:chun-li,id:31=shocked.png,Ah... Chun-Li, stop! That hurts just from looking at it!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jolyne=thinking.png,That's a weird tattoo. What girl would be dumb enough to forget her panties?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri,targetSaidMarker:mika_lifting,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,id:34=shocked.png,Oh, this could end badly...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kizuna=serious.png,You should really know your body better. Didn't you go through puberty?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika,targetSaidMarker:cammy_help,alsoPlaying:cammy_white,id:56=shocked.png,Oh my goodness...!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rarity_eg=happy.png,Having experience making clothes doesn't mean you enjoy taking them off, huh?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven,targetStage:3=thinking.png,You wouldn't wear panties under a leotard like that, would you?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ryuko=shocked.png,You two must be really good friends if you are okay with her pansting you.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sheena=sad.png,(No more spirits, please... No more spirits, please... No more...)
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=shocked.png,Ah...!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:syrenne=smug.png,Why are you so mad? It was just beer, wasn't it? Pfff, amateur.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,id:50=calm.png,I don't think even I'm as confident in my own body as you, ~name~.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&saying;geode:=thinking.png,Geode? Is that the thing you have around your neck? Is it special in any way?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;tharja:=serious.png,If I was ~player~ I'd be seriously scared of her considering how obsessed she is.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nugi-chan:=thinking.png,Oh, I was expecting you to be shaved, ~name~, just because of how organized you seem. But there's nothing wrong with some hair!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;misty_hgss&saying;skinny dipping:=embarrassed.png,Skinny dipping must be fun. But I still wouldn't do it unless there's no one around.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sayori:=sad.png,This is hard to watch. I wish you'd quit at the start of the game.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sheena:=shocked.png,Where did your pants go? I-it wasn't the spirits, right?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;misato:=thinking.png,You look like you're enjoying yourself now, Misato. I hope it's not just because of the drinking.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;syrenne:=smiling.png,You should drink sake. I'll even join you, but after the game. I need to keep my head clear.

3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:kamina=embarrassed.png,If I'm blushing, it's not because of your nudity. I just find you annoying...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible=serious.png,Why is showing your chest such a big deal for us compared to men? I don't know, it just is.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible=sad.png,It would be nice to live in a world in which women can show their chests without everyone making a big deal about it.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,filter:kind,oneShotId:165=sad.png,If you were a bad person, I wouldn't care much about you going through this, but it's ~name~.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,filter:kind,oneShotId:165=sad.png,I would be 100% on board with winning in this game if only the bad people lost. But with ~name~...? Not so much.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,filter:kind,oneShotId:165=sad.png,I'm sorry, ~name~. I mean it, you're a good girl and this doesn't bring me any pleasure.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=furious.png,Only some of the flowers? Remove them all!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:cammy_white,id:30=thinking.png,(For being so short, she has a nice butt. If maybe a little big.)
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:cammy_white,targetSaidMarker:juri_help,alsoPlaying:juri,alsoPlayingStage:0,id:36=shocked.png,What the hell?! She just...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chun-li,targetSaidMarker:juri_attack,alsoPlaying:juri,alsoPlayingStage:4-5,id:21=shocked.png,Chun-Li! That crazy woman is behind you!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee2,targetSayingMarker:bee3=shocked.png,That bee came back?! That's it, I'm leaving!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kizuna=serious.png,Your bra already? Are you <i>trying</i> to get naked?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=shocked.png,Huh? Where did your clothes go? Wait, you <i>were</i> wearing a breastplate, weren't you?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:misty_hgss=calm.png,Oh, you're removing only the top half of your swimsuit. I guess that makes sense, since it's covering all your <i>valuable</i> parts.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ribbon_girl=serious.png,You're gonna expose your breasts already? Why don't you take off your mask? That's a mask, right?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:saki_zls,id:7=shocked.png,WAAAHH!! GET ME OUT OF HERE!!!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sakura,id:4=serious.png,Hey! You should treat your underwear with more care. If you lose it, a pervert might steal it.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sayaka,targetStage:3=thinking.png,I'm not sure I'd wear a bra under a corset, but that's up to you.
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena=shocked.png,W-what is thaaat?!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=shocked.png,Wait! That bra is too small for this!
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=shocked.png,Now your bra, huh? Is this really just for comfort, or are people in your kingdom not used to wearing underwear?
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:weiss_schnee,targetSayingMarker:weiss_attempts_bribery=greedy.png,Yes! I accept! You can leave with my clothes too, depending on how much you're willing to pay...
3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2=smiling.png,You come on pretty strong for being so small. It's would be funny if it wasn't clear you really mean it.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible=serious.png,Why does it feel like such a looong time since I've seen a woman with small breasts?
3-female_small_chest_is_visible=smiling.png,I have <i>lots</i> of friends with small breasts. Like, umm... Well...
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba=embarrassed.png,I suppose we're not related after all... I didn't say anything.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:kizuna=thinking.png,Why wouldn't you have nipples? ...On second thought, forget I asked.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:ribbon_girl=thinking.png,I can't say I get it... In my experience, masked fighters is the kind of stuff guys are into.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:saki_zls=furious.png,W-w-what is with you? Is it too much to ask for a zombie to stay in one piece?
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:shimakaze=thinking.png,How are you doing this? Did you eat a Devil Fruit that allows you to explode your own clothes, or something? Although that would be a very useless ability.
3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:weiss_schnee,targetSaidMarker:weiss_attempts_bribery=furious.png,Why did no one else take the money?! What's wrong with you people that you'd rather see a topless girl than be rich? Perverts!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=smiling.png,My breasts were around that same size a couple of years ago. Well, maybe a little bigger.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=serious.png,What kind of language is that?
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=serious.png,That's two more rounds you're playing after getting naked.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:cammy_white,targetSaidMarker:juri_help,alsoPlaying:juri,alsoPlayingStage:0,id:33=furious.png,Punch her, Cammy! Maybe I should punch her too...
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee3,targetSayingMarker:exposed_chest=sad.png,You killed it? Now I feel bad, I just wanted it to go away. After all, it was just a bee, not a spider.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=serious.png,Hopefully, you can't do that to <i>our</i> clothes. You look like you might enjoy that.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:misty_hgss=smiling.png,That's not the <i>One Piece</i> Luffy is after... Heh, sorry that's a stupid joke, but I had to say it.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,id:47=shocked.png,Oh... At least we have one thing in common, Sayaka.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=thinking.png,Even if you still have clothes, we've already seen everything you have under. There are no more mysteries here.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan,targetStage:3=thinking.png,Now that I know you better, I'm not surprised you don't wear a bra, but that you still wear panties.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,id:22=shocked.png,Huh? (What kind of move is that?)
3-female_large_chest_is_visible=serious.png,Isn't it unfair how we sometimes get so much hate from girls with small breasts? It's not our fault, right?
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:chun-li,targetSaidMarker:juri_attack,alsoPlaying:juri,alsoPlayingStage:4,id:22=shocked.png,Huh? (What kind of move is that?)
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:chun-li,targetSaidMarker:juri_attack,alsoPlaying:juri,alsoPlayingStage:6,id:22=shocked.png,Huh? (What kind of move is that?)
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:nugi-chan=shocked.png,What's wrong with your nipples?! Oh, you have band aids over them... Sorry, I didn't see it right.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:sheena=sad.png,Tell me there aren't really spirits... It was just an illusion, right? I need to be able to sleep tonight.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=sad.png,I really don't want you to do this for us, ~name~. I may be a pirate, but I'm not cruel.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=smiling.png,I would really be okay with the game ending when we get to our underwear, ha ha...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie:=smug.png,(Did she forget she still has her necklace and stockings? Well, I'm not going to remind her.)
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;0:=shocked.png,Hey, what are you doing?! Even I know that isn't how a princess should act.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;misty_hgss:=smiling.png,My, you're very confident in your own body, Misty. I mean, why wouldn't you be? All that swimming makes you look amazing.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=smiling.png,You're not going to run away, are you?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=calm.png,Finally, no more flowers.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:cammy_white,id:29=shocked.png,Oh, I wasn't expecting that...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:cammy_white,targetSaidMarker:chunli_help,alsoPlaying:chun-li,id:31=shocked.png,Ah... Chun-Li, stop! That hurts just from looking at it!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jolyne=thinking.png,That's a weird tattoo. What girl would be dumb enough to forget her panties?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri,targetSaidMarker:mika_lifting,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,id:34=shocked.png,Oh, this could end badly...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kizuna=serious.png,You should really know your body better. Didn't you go through puberty?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika,targetSaidMarker:cammy_help,alsoPlaying:cammy_white,id:56=shocked.png,Oh my goodness...!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rarity_eg=happy.png,Having experience making clothes doesn't mean you enjoy taking them off, huh?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven,targetStage:3=thinking.png,You wouldn't wear panties under a leotard like that, would you?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ryuko=shocked.png,You two must be really good friends if you are okay with her pansting you.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sheena=sad.png,(No more spirits, please... No more spirits, please... No more...)
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=shocked.png,Ah...!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:syrenne=smug.png,Why are you so mad? It was just beer, wasn't it? Pfff, amateur.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,id:50=calm.png,I don't think even I'm as confident in my own body as you, ~name~.
3-female_crotch_is_visible=serious.png,This is the most private part of woman's body. Being forced to show it for the entertainment of others is just...
3-female_crotch_is_visible=sad.png,I really hope I don't get to the point in which I have to show mine. I'm refined lady, after all.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&saying;geode:=thinking.png,Geode? Is that the thing you have around your neck? Is it special in any way?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;tharja:=serious.png,If I was ~player~ I'd be seriously scared of her considering how obsessed she is.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nugi-chan:=thinking.png,Oh, I was expecting you to be shaved, ~name~, just because of how organized you seem. But there's nothing wrong with some hair!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;misty_hgss&saying;skinny dipping:=embarrassed.png,Skinny dipping must be fun. But I still wouldn't do it unless there's no one around.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sayori:=sad.png,This is hard to watch. I wish you'd quit at the start of the game.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sheena:=shocked.png,Where did your pants go? I-it wasn't the spirits, right?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;misato:=thinking.png,You look like you're enjoying yourself now, Misato. I hope it's not just because of the drinking.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;syrenne:=smiling.png,You should drink sake. I'll even join you, but after the game. I need to keep my head clear.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;revy:,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;5&sayingmarker;revyfight:,id:79=furious.png,Hey, no fighting! I have enough of that already back at the ship with Zoro and Sanji.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:97,count-hairy&role;target:=calm.png,Wow, if I had hair like that there's no way I could wear a bikini.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:97,count-hairy&role;target:=smiling.png,I see you're a... free spirit, ~name~.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:97,count-hairy&role;target:=thinking.png,Hmmm, that's way more hair than I'd be comfortable with. Do I care too much about stuff like that?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:98,count-shaved&role;target:=embarrassed.png,I, uhh... always leave a little hair when I shave. I don't know why.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:98,count-shaved&role;target:=calm.png,What do you use for shaving, ~name~? Oh, sorry. We can talk about this later.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:98,count-shaved&role;target:=thinking.png,So you take care of your personal appearance. But do you do it for yourself?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:181=serious.png,You're even more of a pervert than Franky.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:181=serious.png,Not even Franky is this set on showing off.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=thinking.png,What can you do? You lost all your clothes.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=sad.png,These Devil Fruit users always think they can do whatever they want, even in a poker game.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy_white=sad.png,What? No, I would never... That sucks.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy_white,targetSaidMarker:chunli_help,alsoPlaying:chun-li,id:32=sad.png,Well, friends forgive each other. I'd forgive Robin if she did that to me, though I doubt she'd make that mistake.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chun-li,targetSaidMarker:mika_pose,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,alsoPlayingStage:3,id:24=thinking.png,This image... looks like something that would be in a magazine Sanji likes to read.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba,targetStage:6=embarrassed.png,I don't think I've ever let my hair grow that much down there, even in my thieving days.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jolyne=sad.png,Oh... Sorry, I didn't mean to call you dumb.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri,targetSaidMarker:mika_lifting,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,id:35=smiling.png,She probably won't thank you, but at least it looks like she won't try to kill you.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kizuna=sad.png,Okay, that's a relief. I was a little worried considering you didn't even know what you have down there.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika,targetSaidMarker:cammy_help,alsoPlaying:cammy_white,id:57=sad.png,Is Cammy turning a little blue? I've seen Luffy look like that when I grab his neck, I don't think it's a good thing.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rarity_eg=smiling.png,Even if you get naked, at least your hair is still very much in style.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,targetStage:4=shocked.png,There's nothing wrong with that! I didn't mean to stare.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ryuko=smiling.png,I understand the importance of shaving if you have to wear that skimpy uniform.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shimakaze=sad.png,Phew, it's over. Now you're naked. No more explosions, hopefully.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=sad.png,I've been called indecent before, but I still wouldn't wear a skirt without panties underneath. Not on purpose, at least.


#lost jeans
4-male_chest_is_visible=serious.png,I'm way too use to men being shirtless. That can't be healthy.
4-male_chest_is_visible=seductive.png,You're a real gentleman, ~name~. Showing your body so I don't have to show mine.
4-male_chest_is_visible,oneShotId:160,priority:1=thinking.png,You don't have any scars on your chest like Luffy and Zoro. Not as big as those, at least.
4-male_chest_is_visible,oneShotId:160,priority:1=calm.png,I'm so used to seeing men with scars on their chest that yours seems unnatural to me.
4-male_chest_is_visible,oneShotId:160,priority:1=smiling.png,No big scars, huh? I guess you're not a man that's always seeking out trouble.
4-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;dust:,id:90=calm.png,Only a Mink would have chest hair like that... Or a very hairy man.
4-male_chest_is_visible,filter:chubby,oneShotId:196=thinking.png,You've <i>kinda</i> let yourself go, ~name~. Well, it's your business. Maybe you just enjoy food way too much.
4-male_chest_is_visible,filter:chubby,oneShotId:196=thinking.png,Exercising a little wouldn't kill you, you know? Sorry,I guess it's none of my business.
4-male_chest_is_visible,filter:chubby,oneShotId:196=calm.png,You sure got a tummy, ~name~. Although that's nothing compared to Luffy right after he eats.
4-male_chest_is_visible,filter:muscular,oneShotId:195=smug.png,I see you take your body seriously. Are those muscles supposed to be intimidating? I don't rely on strength to fight.
4-male_chest_is_visible,filter:muscular,oneShotId:195=thinking.png,You must train on a daily basis to have muscles like that. Still, I've seen better.
4-male_chest_is_visible,filter:muscular,oneShotId:195=thinking.png,You probably train a lot to have a body like that. Probably as much as Zoro. Everytime he's not sleeping, he's training.
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kamina=thinking.png,You're dropping your underwear now? I should be surprised, but considering how eccentric you are...
4-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=calm.png,Come on, Pit. I'm sure you're braver than you look.
4-male_small_crotch_is_visible=sad.png,That's, uh... small, isn't it? I'm sorry, ~name~.
4-male_small_crotch_is_visible=sad.png,It's... kind of small. I hope you haven't been bullied because of that.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=smiling.png,Well, I'll be damn. You're a vigorous man after all, ~name~.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=smiling.png,Heh, you're a man, alright...
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ryuji:=smiling.png,Heh, I had a feeling you weren't actually a blonde. You didn't act like one.
4-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=smiling.png,Oh, so sky men are not different from regular men <i>down there</i>. I've always been curious, but that's not the kind of thing you can just ask.
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,Aren't you enjoying this game <i>way</i> too much, ~name~?
4-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,I hope that's not its... "default" size.

4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,id:47=shocked.png,Oh... At least we have one thing in common, Sayaka.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=thinking.png,Even if you still have clothes, we've already seen everything you have under. There are no more mysteries here.
4-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan,targetStage:3=thinking.png,Now that I know you better, I'm not surprised you don't wear a bra, but that you still wear panties.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,id:22=shocked.png,Huh? (What kind of move is that?)
4-female_large_chest_is_visible=serious.png,Isn't it unfair how we sometimes get so much hate from girls with small breasts? It's not our fault, right?
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:chun-li,targetSaidMarker:juri_attack,alsoPlaying:juri,alsoPlayingStage:4,id:22=shocked.png,Huh? (What kind of move is that?)
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:chun-li,targetSaidMarker:juri_attack,alsoPlaying:juri,alsoPlayingStage:6,id:22=shocked.png,Huh? (What kind of move is that?)
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:nugi-chan=shocked.png,What's wrong with your nipples?! Oh, you have band aids over them... Sorry, I didn't see it right.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:sheena=sad.png,Tell me there aren't really spirits... It was just an illusion, right? I need to be able to sleep tonight.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible=sad.png,I really don't want you to do this for us, ~name~. I may be a pirate, but I'm not cruel.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible=smiling.png,I would really be okay with the game ending when we get to our underwear, ha ha...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie:=smug.png,(Did she forget she still has her necklace and stockings? Well, I'm not going to remind her.)
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;0:=shocked.png,Hey, what are you doing?! Even I know that isn't how a princess should act.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;misty_hgss:=smiling.png,My, you're very confident in your own body, Misty. I mean, why wouldn't you be? All that swimming makes you look amazing.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=smiling.png,You're not going to run away, are you?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=calm.png,Finally, no more flowers.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:cammy_white,id:29=shocked.png,Oh, I wasn't expecting that...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:cammy_white,targetSaidMarker:chunli_help,alsoPlaying:chun-li,id:31=shocked.png,Ah... Chun-Li, stop! That hurts just from looking at it!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jolyne=thinking.png,That's a weird tattoo. What girl would be dumb enough to forget her panties?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri,targetSaidMarker:mika_lifting,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,id:34=shocked.png,Oh, this could end badly...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kizuna=serious.png,You should really know your body better. Didn't you go through puberty?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika,targetSaidMarker:cammy_help,alsoPlaying:cammy_white,id:56=shocked.png,Oh my goodness...!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rarity_eg=happy.png,Having experience making clothes doesn't mean you enjoy taking them off, huh?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven,targetStage:3=thinking.png,You wouldn't wear panties under a leotard like that, would you?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ryuko=shocked.png,You two must be really good friends if you are okay with her pansting you.

4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=shocked.png,Ah...!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:syrenne=smug.png,Why are you so mad? It was just beer, wasn't it? Pfff, amateur.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,id:50=calm.png,I don't think even I'm as confident in my own body as you, ~name~.
4-female_crotch_is_visible=serious.png,This is the most private part of woman's body. Being forced to show it for the entertainment of others is just...
4-female_crotch_is_visible=sad.png,I really hope I don't get to the point in which I have to show mine. I'm refined lady, after all.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&saying;geode:=thinking.png,Geode? Is that the thing you have around your neck? Is it special in any way?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;tharja:=serious.png,If I was ~player~ I'd be seriously scared of her considering how obsessed she is.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nugi-chan:=thinking.png,Oh, I was expecting you to be shaved, ~name~, just because of how organized you seem. But there's nothing wrong with some hair!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;misty_hgss&saying;skinny dipping:=embarrassed.png,Skinny dipping must be fun. But I still wouldn't do it unless there's no one around.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sayori:=sad.png,This is hard to watch. I wish you'd quit at the start of the game.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sheena:=shocked.png,Where did your pants go? I-it wasn't the spirits, right?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;misato:=thinking.png,You look like you're enjoying yourself now, Misato. I hope it's not just because of the drinking.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;syrenne:=smiling.png,You should drink sake. I'll even join you, but after the game. I need to keep my head clear.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;revy:,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;5&sayingmarker;revyfight:,id:79=furious.png,Hey, no fighting! I have enough of that already back at the ship with Zoro and Sanji.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:97,count-hairy&role;target:=calm.png,Wow, if I had hair like that there's no way I could wear a bikini.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:97,count-hairy&role;target:=smiling.png,I see you're a... free spirit, ~name~.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:97,count-hairy&role;target:=thinking.png,Hmmm, that's way more hair than I'd be comfortable with. Do I care too much about stuff like that?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:98,count-shaved&role;target:=embarrassed.png,I, uhh... always leave a little hair when I shave. I don't know why.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:98,count-shaved&role;target:=calm.png,What do you use for shaving, ~name~? Oh, sorry. We can talk about this later.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:98,count-shaved&role;target:=thinking.png,So you take care of your personal appearance. But do you do it for yourself?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:181=serious.png,You're even more of a pervert than Franky.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:181=serious.png,Not even Franky is this set on showing off.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=thinking.png,What can you do? You lost all your clothes.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=sad.png,These Devil Fruit users always think they can do whatever they want, even in a poker game.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy_white=sad.png,What? No, I would never... That sucks.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy_white,targetSaidMarker:chunli_help,alsoPlaying:chun-li,id:32=sad.png,Well, friends forgive each other. I'd forgive Robin if she did that to me, though I doubt she'd make that mistake.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chun-li,targetSaidMarker:mika_pose,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,alsoPlayingStage:3,id:24=thinking.png,This image... looks like something that would be in a magazine Sanji likes to read.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba,targetStage:6=embarrassed.png,I don't think I've ever let my hair grow that much down there, even in my thieving days.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jolyne=sad.png,Oh... Sorry, I didn't mean to call you dumb.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri,targetSaidMarker:mika_lifting,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,id:35=smiling.png,She probably won't thank you, but at least it looks like she won't try to kill you.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kizuna=sad.png,Okay, that's a relief. I was a little worried considering you didn't even know what you have down there.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika,targetSaidMarker:cammy_help,alsoPlaying:cammy_white,id:57=sad.png,Is Cammy turning a little blue? I've seen Luffy look like that when I grab his neck, I don't think it's a good thing.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rarity_eg=smiling.png,Even if you get naked, at least your hair is still very much in style.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,targetStage:4=shocked.png,There's nothing wrong with that! I didn't mean to stare.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ryuko=smiling.png,I understand the importance of shaving if you have to wear that skimpy uniform.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shimakaze=sad.png,Phew, it's over. Now you're naked. No more explosions, hopefully.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=sad.png,I've been called indecent before, but I still wouldn't wear a skirt without panties underneath. Not on purpose, at least.


#lost top
5-male_chest_will_be_visible=smiling.png,Now you have to expose your chest, ~name~? Isn't it about time you gave up?
5-male_chest_will_be_visible=serious.png,Oh, you're going to show your chest. What a tragedy...
5-male_chest_is_visible=sad.png,Sorry, I'm worried I'm going to lose soon...
5-male_chest_is_visible=sad.png,Eh, sorry... I'm just feeling nervous.
5-male_chest_is_visible,oneShotId:160,priority:1=thinking.png,You don't have any scars on your chest like Luffy and Zoro. Not as big as those, at least.
5-male_chest_is_visible,oneShotId:160,priority:1=calm.png,I'm so used to seeing men with scars on their chest that yours seems unnatural to me.
5-male_chest_is_visible,oneShotId:160,priority:1=smiling.png,No big scars, huh? I guess you're not a man that's always seeking out trouble.
5-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;dust:,id:90=calm.png,Only a Mink would have chest hair like that... Or a very hairy man.
5-male_chest_is_visible,filter:chubby,oneShotId:196=thinking.png,You've <i>kinda</i> let yourself go, ~name~. Well, it's your business. Maybe you just enjoy food way too much.
5-male_chest_is_visible,filter:chubby,oneShotId:196=thinking.png,Exercising a little wouldn't kill you, you know? Sorry,I guess it's none of my business.
5-male_chest_is_visible,filter:chubby,oneShotId:196=calm.png,You sure got a tummy, ~name~. Although that's nothing compared to Luffy right after he eats.
5-male_chest_is_visible,filter:muscular,oneShotId:195=smug.png,I see you take your body seriously. Are those muscles supposed to be intimidating? I don't rely on strength to fight.
5-male_chest_is_visible,filter:muscular,oneShotId:195=thinking.png,You must train on a daily basis to have muscles like that. Still, I've seen better.
5-male_chest_is_visible,filter:muscular,oneShotId:195=thinking.png,You probably train a lot to have a body like that. Probably as much as Zoro. Everytime he's not sleeping, he's training.
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible=serious.png,If I had more clothes on, I might have some sympathy for you. But now it's too late.
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kamina=thinking.png,You're dropping your underwear now? I should be surprised, but considering how eccentric you are...
5-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=calm.png,Come on, Pit. I'm sure you're braver than you look.
5-male_small_crotch_is_visible=smiling.png,I'm sure there's a Devil Fruit somewhere that increases the size of your little friend. Maybe you should look into it.
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=sad.png,Looking at this reminded me of the time Robin squeezed Franky's... Ugh, why can't I still get that image out of my head?
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ryuji:=smiling.png,Heh, I had a feeling you weren't actually a blonde. You didn't act like one.
5-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=smiling.png,Oh, so sky men are not different from regular men <i>down there</i>. I've always been curious, but that's not the kind of thing you can just ask.
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible=seductive.png,Wow, that's big! A-a man of such gift doesn't need to play this game! Why don't you take it easy, and just quit, ~name~?
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible=smiling.png,T-that's it? It's so small. I've seen waaaay bigger ones. Why don't you go cry about it and stop playing the game? (Agh, no one would believe that...)
5-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:kamina=embarrassed.png,If I'm blushing, it's not because of your nudity. I just find you annoying...
5-female_chest_will_be_visible=sad.png,It wasn't easy for me. But if I got through it, so will you.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible=sad.png,Should I be happy that more women are going topless? No, it's terrible.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,filter:kind,oneShotId:165=sad.png,If you were a bad person, I wouldn't care much about you going through this, but it's ~name~.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,filter:kind,oneShotId:165=sad.png,I would be 100% on board with winning in this game if only the bad people lost. But with ~name~...? Not so much.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,filter:kind,oneShotId:165=sad.png,I'm sorry, ~name~. I mean it, you're a good girl and this doesn't bring me any pleasure.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=furious.png,Only some of the flowers? Remove them all!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:cammy_white,id:30=thinking.png,(For being so short, she has a nice butt. If maybe a little big.)
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:cammy_white,targetSaidMarker:juri_help,alsoPlaying:juri,alsoPlayingStage:0,id:36=shocked.png,What the hell?! She just...
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chun-li,targetSaidMarker:juri_attack,alsoPlaying:juri,alsoPlayingStage:4-5,id:21=shocked.png,Chun-Li! That crazy woman is behind you!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee2,targetSayingMarker:bee3=shocked.png,That bee came back?! That's it, I'm leaving!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kizuna=serious.png,Your bra already? Are you <i>trying</i> to get naked?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=shocked.png,Huh? Where did your clothes go? Wait, you <i>were</i> wearing a breastplate, weren't you?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:misty_hgss=calm.png,Oh, you're removing only the top half of your swimsuit. I guess that makes sense, since it's covering all your <i>valuable</i> parts.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ribbon_girl=serious.png,You're gonna expose your breasts already? Why don't you take off your mask? That's a mask, right?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:saki_zls,id:7=shocked.png,WAAAHH!! GET ME OUT OF HERE!!!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sakura,id:4=serious.png,Hey! You should treat your underwear with more care. If you lose it, a pervert might steal it.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sayaka,targetStage:3=thinking.png,I'm not sure I'd wear a bra under a corset, but that's up to you.
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena=shocked.png,W-what is thaaat?!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=shocked.png,Wait! That bra is too small for this!
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=shocked.png,Now your bra, huh? Is this really just for comfort, or are people in your kingdom not used to wearing underwear?
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:weiss_schnee,targetSayingMarker:weiss_attempts_bribery=greedy.png,Yes! I accept! You can leave with my clothes too, depending on how much you're willing to pay...
5-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2=smiling.png,You come on pretty strong for being so small. It's would be funny if it wasn't clear you really mean it.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible=smiling.png,At least men won't be drooling over you if you have such small breasts. Eh... that sounded better in my head.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible=smiling.png,Hey, if you have small breasts that means you have more space to keep important stuff inside your bra. Like your money.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba=embarrassed.png,I suppose we're not related after all... I didn't say anything.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:kizuna=thinking.png,Why wouldn't you have nipples? ...On second thought, forget I asked.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:ribbon_girl=thinking.png,I can't say I get it... In my experience, masked fighters is the kind of stuff guys are into.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:saki_zls=furious.png,W-w-what is with you? Is it too much to ask for a zombie to stay in one piece?
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:shimakaze=thinking.png,How are you doing this? Did you eat a Devil Fruit that allows you to explode your own clothes, or something? Although that would be a very useless ability.
5-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:weiss_schnee,targetSaidMarker:weiss_attempts_bribery=furious.png,Why did no one else take the money?! What's wrong with you people that you'd rather see a topless girl than be rich? Perverts!
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible=smiling.png,They're definitely not small, but maybe they'll still grow more. That happened to me.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible=smiling.png,They're perfect the way they are, ~name~. You don't have to compare them with mine.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=serious.png,What kind of language is that?
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=serious.png,That's two more rounds you're playing after getting naked.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:cammy_white,targetSaidMarker:juri_help,alsoPlaying:juri,alsoPlayingStage:0,id:33=furious.png,Punch her, Cammy! Maybe I should punch her too...
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee3,targetSayingMarker:exposed_chest=sad.png,You killed it? Now I feel bad, I just wanted it to go away. After all, it was just a bee, not a spider.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=serious.png,Hopefully, you can't do that to <i>our</i> clothes. You look like you might enjoy that.
5-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:misty_hgss=smiling.png,That's not the <i>One Piece</i> Luffy is after... Heh, sorry that's a stupid joke, but I had to say it.

5-female_large_chest_is_visible=calm.png,Hmmm, are they bigger than mine? Maybe they're around Robin's size.
5-female_large_chest_is_visible=thinking.png,That's big. And I think I know a little about that...
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,id:22=shocked.png,Huh? (What kind of move is that?)
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:chun-li,targetSaidMarker:juri_attack,alsoPlaying:juri,alsoPlayingStage:4,id:22=shocked.png,Huh? (What kind of move is that?)

5-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:sheena=sad.png,Tell me there aren't really spirits... It was just an illusion, right? I need to be able to sleep tonight.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible=calm.png,I'm sorry, ~name~. I should support you now, but in this game it's win or die.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie:=smug.png,(Did she forget she still has her necklace and stockings? Well, I'm not going to remind her.)
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;0:=shocked.png,Hey, what are you doing?! Even I know that isn't how a princess should act.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;misty_hgss:=smiling.png,My, you're very confident in your own body, Misty. I mean, why wouldn't you be? All that swimming makes you look amazing.

5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=calm.png,Finally, no more flowers.

5-female_crotch_is_visible=sad.png,Look at us, exposing our bodies for the chance to win some money and a little fun... Will it be worth it in the end?
5-female_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,I pray I don't lose another round. Man, this game is getting under my skin.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&saying;geode:=thinking.png,Geode? Is that the thing you have around your neck? Is it special in any way?

5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sheena:=shocked.png,Where did your pants go? I-it wasn't the spirits, right?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;misato:=thinking.png,You look like you're enjoying yourself now, Misato. I hope it's not just because of the drinking.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;syrenne:=smiling.png,You should drink sake. I'll even join you, but after the game. I need to keep my head clear.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;revy:,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;5&sayingmarker;revyfight:,id:79=furious.png,Hey, no fighting! I have enough of that already back at the ship with Zoro and Sanji.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:97,count-hairy&role;target:=calm.png,Wow, if I had hair like that there's no way I could wear a bikini.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:97,count-hairy&role;target:=smiling.png,I see you're a... free spirit, ~name~.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:97,count-hairy&role;target:=thinking.png,Hmmm, that's way more hair than I'd be comfortable with. Do I care too much about stuff like that?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:98,count-shaved&role;target:=embarrassed.png,I, uhh... always leave a little hair when I shave. I don't know why.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:98,count-shaved&role;target:=calm.png,What do you use for shaving, ~name~? Oh, sorry. We can talk about this later.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:98,count-shaved&role;target:=thinking.png,So you take care of your personal appearance. But do you do it for yourself?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:181=serious.png,You're even more of a pervert than Franky.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:181=serious.png,Not even Franky is this set on showing off.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=thinking.png,What can you do? You lost all your clothes.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=sad.png,These Devil Fruit users always think they can do whatever they want, even in a poker game.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy_white=sad.png,What? No, I would never... That sucks.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy_white,targetSaidMarker:chunli_help,alsoPlaying:chun-li,id:32=sad.png,Well, friends forgive each other. I'd forgive Robin if she did that to me, though I doubt she'd make that mistake.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chun-li,targetSaidMarker:mika_pose,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,alsoPlayingStage:3,id:24=thinking.png,This image... looks like something that would be in a magazine Sanji likes to read.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba,targetStage:6=embarrassed.png,I don't think I've ever let my hair grow that much down there, even in my thieving days.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jolyne=sad.png,Oh... Sorry, I didn't mean to call you dumb.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri,targetSaidMarker:mika_lifting,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,id:35=smiling.png,She probably won't thank you, but at least it looks like she won't try to kill you.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kizuna=sad.png,Okay, that's a relief. I was a little worried considering you didn't even know what you have down there.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika,targetSaidMarker:cammy_help,alsoPlaying:cammy_white,id:57=sad.png,Is Cammy turning a little blue? I've seen Luffy look like that when I grab his neck, I don't think it's a good thing.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rarity_eg=smiling.png,Even if you get naked, at least your hair is still very much in style.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,targetStage:4=shocked.png,There's nothing wrong with that! I didn't mean to stare.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ryuko=smiling.png,I understand the importance of shaving if you have to wear that skimpy uniform.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shimakaze=sad.png,Phew, it's over. Now you're naked. No more explosions, hopefully.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=sad.png,I've been called indecent before, but I still wouldn't wear a skirt without panties underneath. Not on purpose, at least.


#naked
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible=smiling.png,Now you have to expose your chest, ~name~? Isn't it about time you gave up?
-3-male_chest_will_be_visible=serious.png,Oh, you're going to show your chest. What a tragedy...
-3-male_chest_is_visible=sad.png,Sorry, I'm worried I'm going to lose soon...
-3-male_chest_is_visible=sad.png,Eh, sorry... I'm just feeling nervous.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,oneShotId:160,priority:1=thinking.png,You don't have any scars on your chest like Luffy and Zoro. Not as big as those, at least.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,oneShotId:160,priority:1=calm.png,I'm so used to seeing men with scars on their chest that yours seems unnatural to me.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,oneShotId:160,priority:1=smiling.png,No big scars, huh? I guess you're not a man that's always seeking out trouble.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,count-role;target&character;dust:,id:90=calm.png,Only a Mink would have chest hair like that... Or a very hairy man.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,filter:chubby,oneShotId:196=thinking.png,You've <i>kinda</i> let yourself go, ~name~. Well, it's your business. Maybe you just enjoy food way too much.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,filter:chubby,oneShotId:196=thinking.png,Exercising a little wouldn't kill you, you know? Sorry,I guess it's none of my business.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,filter:chubby,oneShotId:196=calm.png,You sure got a tummy, ~name~. Although that's nothing compared to Luffy right after he eats.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,filter:muscular,oneShotId:195=smug.png,I see you take your body seriously. Are those muscles supposed to be intimidating? I don't rely on strength to fight.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,filter:muscular,oneShotId:195=thinking.png,You must train on a daily basis to have muscles like that. Still, I've seen better.
-3-male_chest_is_visible,filter:muscular,oneShotId:195=thinking.png,You probably train a lot to have a body like that. Probably as much as Zoro. Everytime he's not sleeping, he's training.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible=serious.png,If I had more clothes on, I might have some sympathy for you. But now it's too late.
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kamina=thinking.png,You're dropping your underwear now? I should be surprised, but considering how eccentric you are...
-3-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=calm.png,Come on, Pit. I'm sure you're braver than you look.
-3-male_small_crotch_is_visible=smiling.png,I'm sure there's a Devil Fruit somewhere that increases the size of your little friend. Maybe you should look into it.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=sad.png,Looking at this reminded me of the time Robin squeezed Franky's... Ugh, why can't I still get that image out of my head?
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ryuji:=smiling.png,Heh, I had a feeling you weren't actually a blonde. You didn't act like one.
-3-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=smiling.png,Oh, so sky men are not different from regular men <i>down there</i>. I've always been curious, but that's not the kind of thing you can just ask.
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=seductive.png,Wow, that's big! A-a man of such gift doesn't need to play this game! Why don't you take it easy, and just quit, ~name~?
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible=smiling.png,T-that's it? It's so small. I've seen waaaay bigger ones. Why don't you go cry about it and stop playing the game? (Agh, no one would believe that...)
-3-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:kamina=embarrassed.png,If I'm blushing, it's not because of your nudity. I just find you annoying...
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible=sad.png,It wasn't easy for me. But if I got through it, so will you.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible=sad.png,Should I be happy that more women are going topless? No, it's terrible.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,filter:kind,oneShotId:165=sad.png,If you were a bad person, I wouldn't care much about you going through this, but it's ~name~.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,filter:kind,oneShotId:165=sad.png,I would be 100% on board with winning in this game if only the bad people lost. But with ~name~...? Not so much.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,filter:kind,oneShotId:165=sad.png,I'm sorry, ~name~. I mean it, you're a good girl and this doesn't bring me any pleasure.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=furious.png,Only some of the flowers? Remove them all!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:cammy_white,id:30=thinking.png,(For being so short, she has a nice butt. If maybe a little big.)
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:cammy_white,targetSaidMarker:juri_help,alsoPlaying:juri,alsoPlayingStage:0,id:36=shocked.png,What the hell?! She just...
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chun-li,targetSaidMarker:juri_attack,alsoPlaying:juri,alsoPlayingStage:4-5,id:21=shocked.png,Chun-Li! That crazy woman is behind you!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee2,targetSayingMarker:bee3=shocked.png,That bee came back?! That's it, I'm leaving!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kizuna=serious.png,Your bra already? Are you <i>trying</i> to get naked?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=shocked.png,Huh? Where did your clothes go? Wait, you <i>were</i> wearing a breastplate, weren't you?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:misty_hgss=calm.png,Oh, you're removing only the top half of your swimsuit. I guess that makes sense, since it's covering all your <i>valuable</i> parts.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ribbon_girl=serious.png,You're gonna expose your breasts already? Why don't you take off your mask? That's a mask, right?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:saki_zls,id:7=shocked.png,WAAAHH!! GET ME OUT OF HERE!!!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sakura,id:4=serious.png,Hey! You should treat your underwear with more care. If you lose it, a pervert might steal it.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sayaka,targetStage:3=thinking.png,I'm not sure I'd wear a bra under a corset, but that's up to you.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena=shocked.png,W-what is thaaat?!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=shocked.png,Wait! That bra is too small for this!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=shocked.png,Now your bra, huh? Is this really just for comfort, or are people in your kingdom not used to wearing underwear?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:weiss_schnee,targetSayingMarker:weiss_attempts_bribery=greedy.png,Yes! I accept! You can leave with my clothes too, depending on how much you're willing to pay...
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2=smiling.png,You come on pretty strong for being so small. It's would be funny if it wasn't clear you really mean it.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible=smiling.png,At least men won't be drooling over you if you have such small breasts. Eh... that sounded better in my head.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible=smiling.png,Hey, if you have small breasts that means you have more space to keep important stuff inside your bra. Like your money.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba=embarrassed.png,I suppose we're not related after all... I didn't say anything.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:kizuna=thinking.png,Why wouldn't you have nipples? ...On second thought, forget I asked.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:ribbon_girl=thinking.png,I can't say I get it... In my experience, masked fighters is the kind of stuff guys are into.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:saki_zls=furious.png,W-w-what is with you? Is it too much to ask for a zombie to stay in one piece?
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:shimakaze=thinking.png,How are you doing this? Did you eat a Devil Fruit that allows you to explode your own clothes, or something? Although that would be a very useless ability.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:weiss_schnee,targetSaidMarker:weiss_attempts_bribery=furious.png,Why did no one else take the money?! What's wrong with you people that you'd rather see a topless girl than be rich? Perverts!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=smiling.png,They're definitely not small, but maybe they'll still grow more. That happened to me.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible=smiling.png,They're perfect the way they are, ~name~. You don't have to compare them with mine.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=serious.png,What kind of language is that?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=serious.png,That's two more rounds you're playing after getting naked.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:cammy_white,targetSaidMarker:juri_help,alsoPlaying:juri,alsoPlayingStage:0,id:33=furious.png,Punch her, Cammy! Maybe I should punch her too...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee3,targetSayingMarker:exposed_chest=sad.png,You killed it? Now I feel bad, I just wanted it to go away. After all, it was just a bee, not a spider.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=serious.png,Hopefully, you can't do that to <i>our</i> clothes. You look like you might enjoy that.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:misty_hgss=smiling.png,That's not the <i>One Piece</i> Luffy is after... Heh, sorry that's a stupid joke, but I had to say it.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,id:47=shocked.png,Oh... At least we have one thing in common, Sayaka.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=thinking.png,Even if you still have clothes, we've already seen everything you have under. There are no more mysteries here.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan,targetStage:3=thinking.png,Now that I know you better, I'm not surprised you don't wear a bra, but that you still wear panties.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible=calm.png,Hmmm, are they bigger than mine? Maybe they're around Robin's size.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible=thinking.png,That's big. And I think I know a little about that...
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,id:22=shocked.png,Huh? (What kind of move is that?)
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:chun-li,targetSaidMarker:juri_attack,alsoPlaying:juri,alsoPlayingStage:4,id:22=shocked.png,Huh? (What kind of move is that?)
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:chun-li,targetSaidMarker:juri_attack,alsoPlaying:juri,alsoPlayingStage:6,id:22=shocked.png,Huh? (What kind of move is that?)
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:nugi-chan=shocked.png,What's wrong with your nipples?! Oh, you have band aids over them... Sorry, I didn't see it right.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:sheena=sad.png,Tell me there aren't really spirits... It was just an illusion, right? I need to be able to sleep tonight.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=calm.png,I'm sorry, ~name~. I should support you now, but in this game it's win or die.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie:=smug.png,(Did she forget she still has her necklace and stockings? Well, I'm not going to remind her.)
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;0:=shocked.png,Hey, what are you doing?! Even I know that isn't how a princess should act.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;misty_hgss:=smiling.png,My, you're very confident in your own body, Misty. I mean, why wouldn't you be? All that swimming makes you look amazing.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=smiling.png,You're not going to run away, are you?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=calm.png,Finally, no more flowers.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:cammy_white,id:29=shocked.png,Oh, I wasn't expecting that...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:cammy_white,targetSaidMarker:chunli_help,alsoPlaying:chun-li,id:31=shocked.png,Ah... Chun-Li, stop! That hurts just from looking at it!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jolyne=thinking.png,That's a weird tattoo. What girl would be dumb enough to forget her panties?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri,targetSaidMarker:mika_lifting,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,id:34=shocked.png,Oh, this could end badly...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kizuna=serious.png,You should really know your body better. Didn't you go through puberty?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika,targetSaidMarker:cammy_help,alsoPlaying:cammy_white,id:56=shocked.png,Oh my goodness...!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rarity_eg=happy.png,Having experience making clothes doesn't mean you enjoy taking them off, huh?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven,targetStage:3=thinking.png,You wouldn't wear panties under a leotard like that, would you?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ryuko=shocked.png,You two must be really good friends if you are okay with her pansting you.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sheena=sad.png,(No more spirits, please... No more spirits, please... No more...)
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=shocked.png,Ah...!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:syrenne=smug.png,Why are you so mad? It was just beer, wasn't it? Pfff, amateur.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,id:50=calm.png,I don't think even I'm as confident in my own body as you, ~name~.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible=sad.png,Look at us, exposing our bodies for the chance to win some money and a little fun... Will it be worth it in the end?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible=shocked.png,I pray I don't lose another round. Man, this game is getting under my skin.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&saying;geode:=thinking.png,Geode? Is that the thing you have around your neck? Is it special in any way?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;tharja:=serious.png,If I was ~player~ I'd be seriously scared of her considering how obsessed she is.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nugi-chan:=thinking.png,Oh, I was expecting you to be shaved, ~name~, just because of how organized you seem. But there's nothing wrong with some hair!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;misty_hgss&saying;skinny dipping:=embarrassed.png,Skinny dipping must be fun. But I still wouldn't do it unless there's no one around.

-3-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;revy:,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;5&sayingmarker;revyfight:,id:79=furious.png,Hey, no fighting! I have enough of that already back at the ship with Zoro and Sanji.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:97,count-hairy&role;target:=calm.png,Wow, if I had hair like that there's no way I could wear a bikini.

-2-male_chest_is_visible,filter:chubby,oneShotId:196=thinking.png,You've <i>kinda</i> let yourself go, ~name~. Well, it's your business. Maybe you just enjoy food way too much.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,filter:chubby,oneShotId:196=thinking.png,Exercising a little wouldn't kill you, you know? Sorry,I guess it's none of my business.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,filter:chubby,oneShotId:196=calm.png,You sure got a tummy, ~name~. Although that's nothing compared to Luffy right after he eats.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,filter:muscular,oneShotId:195=smug.png,I see you take your body seriously. Are those muscles supposed to be intimidating? I don't rely on strength to fight.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,filter:muscular,oneShotId:195=thinking.png,You must train on a daily basis to have muscles like that. Still, I've seen better.
-2-male_chest_is_visible,filter:muscular,oneShotId:195=thinking.png,You probably train a lot to have a body like that. Probably as much as Zoro. Everytime he's not sleeping, he's training.
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible=custom:calm,Normally I wouldn't want to see this, but now...
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible=custom:smiling,(~Name~ is going to show it... I don't remember the last time I felt like this.)
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kamina=thinking.png,You're dropping your underwear now? I should be surprised, but considering how eccentric you are...
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:pit=calm.png,Come on, Pit. I'm sure you're braver than you look.
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible=custom:sad,Oh... You don't think I'm cute enough,  ~name~?
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible=custom:smiling,It's kind of adorable, but I'm not sure it would be very functional. But I may be wrong.
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=custom:happy,Heheh... Sorry, I wasn't laughing at your... you know. I just think you look adorable, ~name~.
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=custom:seductive,This suits me just fine...
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;ryuji:=smiling.png,Heh, I had a feeling you weren't actually a blonde. You didn't act like one.
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=smiling.png,Oh, so sky men are not different from regular men <i>down there</i>. I've always been curious, but that's not the kind of thing you can just ask.
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=custom:shocked,W-what?! But that... And mine... Oh...
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=custom:embarrassed2,For a feeble little girl like me, this is a very intimidating sight.
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:kamina=embarrassed.png,If I'm blushing, it's not because of your nudity. I just find you annoying...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible=custom:calm,You shouldn't feel that awkward doing this now with me standing here, fully naked and wet.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible=custom:smiling,I prefer treasure chests, but I'll take it.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,filter:kind,oneShotId:165=sad.png,If you were a bad person, I wouldn't care much about you going through this, but it's ~name~.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,filter:kind,oneShotId:165=sad.png,I would be 100% on board with winning in this game if only the bad people lost. But with ~name~...? Not so much.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,filter:kind,oneShotId:165=sad.png,I'm sorry, ~name~. I mean it, you're a good girl and this doesn't bring me any pleasure.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=furious.png,Only some of the flowers? Remove them all!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:cammy_white,id:30=thinking.png,(For being so short, she has a nice butt. If maybe a little big.)

-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:kyu=shocked.png,Huh? Where did your clothes go? Wait, you <i>were</i> wearing a breastplate, weren't you?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:misty_hgss=calm.png,Oh, you're removing only the top half of your swimsuit. I guess that makes sense, since it's covering all your <i>valuable</i> parts.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:ribbon_girl=serious.png,You're gonna expose your breasts already? Why don't you take off your mask? That's a mask, right?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:saki_zls,id:7=shocked.png,WAAAHH!! GET ME OUT OF HERE!!!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sakura,id:4=serious.png,Hey! You should treat your underwear with more care. If you lose it, a pervert might steal it.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sayaka,targetStage:3=thinking.png,I'm not sure I'd wear a bra under a corset, but that's up to you.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:sheena=shocked.png,W-what is thaaat?!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=shocked.png,Wait! That bra is too small for this!
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=shocked.png,Now your bra, huh? Is this really just for comfort, or are people in your kingdom not used to wearing underwear?
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:weiss_schnee,targetSayingMarker:weiss_attempts_bribery=greedy.png,Yes! I accept! You can leave with my clothes too, depending on how much you're willing to pay...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2=smiling.png,You come on pretty strong for being so small. It's would be funny if it wasn't clear you really mean it.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible=custom:smiling,Well, they didn't seem to be big even when you were wearing clothes.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible=custom:thinking,They would feel even smaller in big hands.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba=embarrassed.png,I suppose we're not related after all... I didn't say anything.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:kizuna=thinking.png,Why wouldn't you have nipples? ...On second thought, forget I asked.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:ribbon_girl=thinking.png,I can't say I get it... In my experience, masked fighters is the kind of stuff guys are into.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:saki_zls=furious.png,W-w-what is with you? Is it too much to ask for a zombie to stay in one piece?
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:shimakaze=thinking.png,How are you doing this? Did you eat a Devil Fruit that allows you to explode your own clothes, or something? Although that would be a very useless ability.
-2-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:weiss_schnee,targetSaidMarker:weiss_attempts_bribery=furious.png,Why did no one else take the money?! What's wrong with you people that you'd rather see a topless girl than be rich? Perverts!
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=custom:calm,My breasts were around that big a couple of years ago. It makes me nostalgic.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible=custom:smug,Don't feel bad that mine are bigger. There's nothing wrong with your breasts.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=serious.png,What kind of language is that?
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=serious.png,That's two more rounds you're playing after getting naked.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:cammy_white,targetSaidMarker:juri_help,alsoPlaying:juri,alsoPlayingStage:0,id:33=furious.png,Punch her, Cammy! Maybe I should punch her too...
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee3,targetSayingMarker:exposed_chest=sad.png,You killed it? Now I feel bad, I just wanted it to go away. After all, it was just a bee, not a spider.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=serious.png,Hopefully, you can't do that to <i>our</i> clothes. You look like you might enjoy that.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:misty_hgss=smiling.png,That's not the <i>One Piece</i> Luffy is after... Heh, sorry that's a stupid joke, but I had to say it.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,id:47=shocked.png,Oh... At least we have one thing in common, Sayaka.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=thinking.png,Even if you still have clothes, we've already seen everything you have under. There are no more mysteries here.
-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan,targetStage:3=thinking.png,Now that I know you better, I'm not surprised you don't wear a bra, but that you still wear panties.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible=custom:thinking,Don't you just hate it when your back hurts?
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible=custom:smiling,Seems like we could exchange our underwear without problem.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,id:22=shocked.png,Huh? (What kind of move is that?)
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:chun-li,targetSaidMarker:juri_attack,alsoPlaying:juri,alsoPlayingStage:4,id:22=shocked.png,Huh? (What kind of move is that?)
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:chun-li,targetSaidMarker:juri_attack,alsoPlaying:juri,alsoPlayingStage:6,id:22=shocked.png,Huh? (What kind of move is that?)
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:nugi-chan=shocked.png,What's wrong with your nipples?! Oh, you have band aids over them... Sorry, I didn't see it right.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:sheena=sad.png,Tell me there aren't really spirits... It was just an illusion, right? I need to be able to sleep tonight.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible=custom:serious,You kept playing and losing until you got to this point. Do you think it'll be worth it, ~name~?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible=custom:smug,If you have trouble with this, the rest will be really hard on you.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;0:=shocked.png,Hey, what are you doing?! Even I know that isn't how a princess should act.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;misty_hgss:=smiling.png,My, you're very confident in your own body, Misty. I mean, why wouldn't you be? All that swimming makes you look amazing.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=smiling.png,You're not going to run away, are you?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=calm.png,Finally, no more flowers.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:cammy_white,id:29=shocked.png,Oh, I wasn't expecting that...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:cammy_white,targetSaidMarker:chunli_help,alsoPlaying:chun-li,id:31=shocked.png,Ah... Chun-Li, stop! That hurts just from looking at it!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jolyne=thinking.png,That's a weird tattoo. What girl would be dumb enough to forget her panties?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri,targetSaidMarker:mika_lifting,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,id:34=shocked.png,Oh, this could end badly...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kizuna=serious.png,You should really know your body better. Didn't you go through puberty?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika,targetSaidMarker:cammy_help,alsoPlaying:cammy_white,id:56=shocked.png,Oh my goodness...!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rarity_eg=happy.png,Having experience making clothes doesn't mean you enjoy taking them off, huh?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven,targetStage:3=thinking.png,You wouldn't wear panties under a leotard like that, would you?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ryuko=shocked.png,You two must be really good friends if you are okay with her pansting you.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sheena=sad.png,(No more spirits, please... No more spirits, please... No more...)
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=shocked.png,Ah...!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:syrenne=smug.png,Why are you so mad? It was just beer, wasn't it? Pfff, amateur.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,id:50=calm.png,I don't think even I'm as confident in my own body as you, ~name~.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible=custom:smiling,If people want to look at me instead of her, I don't mind. I'm not that uncomfortable anymore.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible=custom:thinking,Maybe you should start getting ready in case you lose again. You know, warm your hands, relax...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&saying;geode:=thinking.png,Geode? Is that the thing you have around your neck? Is it special in any way?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;tharja:=serious.png,If I was ~player~ I'd be seriously scared of her considering how obsessed she is.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nugi-chan:=thinking.png,Oh, I was expecting you to be shaved, ~name~, just because of how organized you seem. But there's nothing wrong with some hair!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;misty_hgss&saying;skinny dipping:=embarrassed.png,Skinny dipping must be fun. But I still wouldn't do it unless there's no one around.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sayori:=sad.png,This is hard to watch. I wish you'd quit at the start of the game.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sheena:=shocked.png,Where did your pants go? I-it wasn't the spirits, right?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;misato:=thinking.png,You look like you're enjoying yourself now, Misato. I hope it's not just because of the drinking.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;syrenne:=smiling.png,You should drink sake. I'll even join you, but after the game. I need to keep my head clear.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;revy:,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;5&sayingmarker;revyfight:,id:79=furious.png,Hey, no fighting! I have enough of that already back at the ship with Zoro and Sanji.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:97,count-hairy&role;target:=calm.png,Wow, if I had hair like that there's no way I could wear a bikini.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:97,count-hairy&role;target:=smiling.png,I see you're a... free spirit, ~name~.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:97,count-hairy&role;target:=thinking.png,Hmmm, that's way more hair than I'd be comfortable with. Do I care too much about stuff like that?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:98,count-shaved&role;target:=embarrassed.png,I, uhh... always leave a little hair when I shave. I don't know why.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:98,count-shaved&role;target:=calm.png,What do you use for shaving, ~name~? Oh, sorry. We can talk about this later.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:98,count-shaved&role;target:=thinking.png,So you take care of your personal appearance. But do you do it for yourself?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:181=serious.png,You're even more of a pervert than Franky.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:181=serious.png,Not even Franky is this set on showing off.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=thinking.png,What can you do? You lost all your clothes.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=sad.png,These Devil Fruit users always think they can do whatever they want, even in a poker game.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy_white=sad.png,What? No, I would never... That sucks.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy_white,targetSaidMarker:chunli_help,alsoPlaying:chun-li,id:32=sad.png,Well, friends forgive each other. I'd forgive Robin if she did that to me, though I doubt she'd make that mistake.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chun-li,targetSaidMarker:mika_pose,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,alsoPlayingStage:3,id:24=thinking.png,This image... looks like something that would be in a magazine Sanji likes to read.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba,targetStage:6=embarrassed.png,I don't think I've ever let my hair grow that much down there, even in my thieving days.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jolyne=sad.png,Oh... Sorry, I didn't mean to call you dumb.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri,targetSaidMarker:mika_lifting,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,id:35=smiling.png,She probably won't thank you, but at least it looks like she won't try to kill you.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kizuna=sad.png,Okay, that's a relief. I was a little worried considering you didn't even know what you have down there.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika,targetSaidMarker:cammy_help,alsoPlaying:cammy_white,id:57=sad.png,Is Cammy turning a little blue? I've seen Luffy look like that when I grab his neck, I don't think it's a good thing.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rarity_eg=smiling.png,Even if you get naked, at least your hair is still very much in style.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,targetStage:4=shocked.png,There's nothing wrong with that! I didn't mean to stare.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ryuko=smiling.png,I understand the importance of shaving if you have to wear that skimpy uniform.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shimakaze=sad.png,Phew, it's over. Now you're naked. No more explosions, hopefully.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=sad.png,I've been called indecent before, but I still wouldn't wear a skirt without panties underneath. Not on purpose, at least.

-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=shocked.png,Now your bra, huh? Is this really just for comfort, or are people in your kingdom not used to wearing underwear?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:weiss_schnee,targetSayingMarker:weiss_attempts_bribery=greedy.png,Yes! I accept! You can leave with my clothes too, depending on how much you're willing to pay...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,targetStage:2=smiling.png,You come on pretty strong for being so small. It's would be funny if it wasn't clear you really mean it.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible=happy.png,Even if they're small, someone skilled can still find fun ways to play with them.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible=smiling.png,Despite being small, I bet they're pretty sensitive to touch.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:futaba=embarrassed.png,I suppose we're not related after all... I didn't say anything.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:kizuna=thinking.png,Why wouldn't you have nipples? ...On second thought, forget I asked.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:ribbon_girl=thinking.png,I can't say I get it... In my experience, masked fighters is the kind of stuff guys are into.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:saki_zls=furious.png,W-w-what is with you? Is it too much to ask for a zombie to stay in one piece?
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:shimakaze=thinking.png,How are you doing this? Did you eat a Devil Fruit that allows you to explode your own clothes, or something? Although that would be a very useless ability.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:weiss_schnee,targetSaidMarker:weiss_attempts_bribery=furious.png,Why did no one else take the money?! What's wrong with you people that you'd rather see a topless girl than be rich? Perverts!
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=calm.png,Oh, so adorable, ~name~! I knew you'd have a nice figure.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=smiling.png,See? What did I say? You look great!
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=serious.png,What kind of language is that?
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=serious.png,That's two more rounds you're playing after getting naked.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:cammy_white,targetSaidMarker:juri_help,alsoPlaying:juri,alsoPlayingStage:0,id:33=furious.png,Punch her, Cammy! Maybe I should punch her too...
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:florina,targetSaidMarker:bee3,targetSayingMarker:exposed_chest=sad.png,You killed it? Now I feel bad, I just wanted it to go away. After all, it was just a bee, not a spider.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kyu=serious.png,Hopefully, you can't do that to <i>our</i> clothes. You look like you might enjoy that.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:misty_hgss=smiling.png,That's not the <i>One Piece</i> Luffy is after... Heh, sorry that's a stupid joke, but I had to say it.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sayaka,targetStage:4,id:47=shocked.png,Oh... At least we have one thing in common, Sayaka.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:2=thinking.png,Even if you still have clothes, we've already seen everything you have under. There are no more mysteries here.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:zone-tan,targetStage:3=thinking.png,Now that I know you better, I'm not surprised you don't wear a bra, but that you still wear panties.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible=smiling.png,Do you think there's such a thing as "too big" when it comes to breasts?
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible=thinking.png,That's one new thing we have in common, sister.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,id:22=shocked.png,Huh? (What kind of move is that?)
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:chun-li,targetSaidMarker:juri_attack,alsoPlaying:juri,alsoPlayingStage:4,id:22=shocked.png,Huh? (What kind of move is that?)
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:chun-li,targetSaidMarker:juri_attack,alsoPlaying:juri,alsoPlayingStage:6,id:22=shocked.png,Huh? (What kind of move is that?)
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:nugi-chan=shocked.png,What's wrong with your nipples?! Oh, you have band aids over them... Sorry, I didn't see it right.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:sheena=sad.png,Tell me there aren't really spirits... It was just an illusion, right? I need to be able to sleep tonight.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=serious.png,Look at it this way, ~name~: No one will be using their imagination to picture you naked after this. I mean, you know they have...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=thinking.png,One of the last remaining mysteries in the game is about to be revealed.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;twilight&stage;0:=shocked.png,Hey, what are you doing?! Even I know that isn't how a princess should act.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,count-role;target&character;misty_hgss:=smiling.png,My, you're very confident in your own body, Misty. I mean, why wouldn't you be? All that swimming makes you look amazing.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:4=smiling.png,You're not going to run away, are you?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=calm.png,Finally, no more flowers.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:cammy_white,id:29=shocked.png,Oh, I wasn't expecting that...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:cammy_white,targetSaidMarker:chunli_help,alsoPlaying:chun-li,id:31=shocked.png,Ah... Chun-Li, stop! That hurts just from looking at it!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:jolyne=thinking.png,That's a weird tattoo. What girl would be dumb enough to forget her panties?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri,targetSaidMarker:mika_lifting,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,id:34=shocked.png,Oh, this could end badly...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kizuna=serious.png,You should really know your body better. Didn't you go through puberty?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika,targetSaidMarker:cammy_help,alsoPlaying:cammy_white,id:56=shocked.png,Oh my goodness...!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rarity_eg=happy.png,Having experience making clothes doesn't mean you enjoy taking them off, huh?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:raven,targetStage:3=thinking.png,You wouldn't wear panties under a leotard like that, would you?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ryuko=shocked.png,You two must be really good friends if you are okay with her pansting you.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sheena=sad.png,(No more spirits, please... No more spirits, please... No more...)
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=shocked.png,Ah...!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:syrenne=smug.png,Why are you so mad? It was just beer, wasn't it? Pfff, amateur.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:zone-tan,id:50=calm.png,I don't think even I'm as confident in my own body as you, ~name~.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible=furious.png,Okay, just continue playing, you guys. You don't have to inspect her body, or something.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible=happy.png,Do you play with it often, ~name~? Come on, we've grown close after all we've been through.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&saying;geode:=thinking.png,Geode? Is that the thing you have around your neck? Is it special in any way?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;tharja:=serious.png,If I was ~player~ I'd be seriously scared of her considering how obsessed she is.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;nugi-chan:=thinking.png,Oh, I was expecting you to be shaved, ~name~, just because of how organized you seem. But there's nothing wrong with some hair!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;misty_hgss&saying;skinny dipping:=embarrassed.png,Skinny dipping must be fun. But I still wouldn't do it unless there's no one around.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sayori:=sad.png,This is hard to watch. I wish you'd quit at the start of the game.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;sheena:=shocked.png,Where did your pants go? I-it wasn't the spirits, right?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;misato:=thinking.png,You look like you're enjoying yourself now, Misato. I hope it's not just because of the drinking.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;syrenne:=smiling.png,You should drink sake. I'll even join you, but after the game. I need to keep my head clear.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,count-role;target&character;revy:,count-role;other&character;meia&stage;5&sayingmarker;revyfight:,id:79=furious.png,Hey, no fighting! I have enough of that already back at the ship with Zoro and Sanji.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:97,count-hairy&role;target:=calm.png,Wow, if I had hair like that there's no way I could wear a bikini.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:97,count-hairy&role;target:=smiling.png,I see you're a... free spirit, ~name~.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:97,count-hairy&role;target:=thinking.png,Hmmm, that's way more hair than I'd be comfortable with. Do I care too much about stuff like that?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:98,count-shaved&role;target:=embarrassed.png,I, uhh... always leave a little hair when I shave. I don't know why.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:98,count-shaved&role;target:=calm.png,What do you use for shaving, ~name~? Oh, sorry. We can talk about this later.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,oneShotId:98,count-shaved&role;target:=thinking.png,So you take care of your personal appearance. But do you do it for yourself?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:181=serious.png,You're even more of a pervert than Franky.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:181=serious.png,Not even Franky is this set on showing off.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=thinking.png,What can you do? You lost all your clothes.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7=sad.png,These Devil Fruit users always think they can do whatever they want, even in a poker game.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy_white=sad.png,What? No, I would never... That sucks.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy_white,targetSaidMarker:chunli_help,alsoPlaying:chun-li,id:32=sad.png,Well, friends forgive each other. I'd forgive Robin if she did that to me, though I doubt she'd make that mistake.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:chun-li,targetSaidMarker:mika_pose,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,alsoPlayingStage:3,id:24=thinking.png,This image... looks like something that would be in a magazine Sanji likes to read.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba,targetStage:6=embarrassed.png,I don't think I've ever let my hair grow that much down there, even in my thieving days.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jolyne=sad.png,Oh... Sorry, I didn't mean to call you dumb.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri,targetSaidMarker:mika_lifting,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,id:35=smiling.png,She probably won't thank you, but at least it looks like she won't try to kill you.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kizuna=sad.png,Okay, that's a relief. I was a little worried considering you didn't even know what you have down there.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika,targetSaidMarker:cammy_help,alsoPlaying:cammy_white,id:57=sad.png,Is Cammy turning a little blue? I've seen Luffy look like that when I grab his neck, I don't think it's a good thing.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rarity_eg=smiling.png,Even if you get naked, at least your hair is still very much in style.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven,targetStage:4=shocked.png,There's nothing wrong with that! I didn't mean to stare.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ryuko=smiling.png,I understand the importance of shaving if you have to wear that skimpy uniform.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shimakaze=sad.png,Phew, it's over. Now you're naked. No more explosions, hopefully.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight,targetStage:1=sad.png,I've been called indecent before, but I still wouldn't wear a skirt without panties underneath. Not on purpose, at least.

0-opponent_lost,alsoPlaying:human,saidMarker:manipulation_final,oneShotId:69,priority:301,marker:target2end=sad.png,Oh, so you didn't lose, ~player~? Did you hear what I said? I'm just worried for your health. Well, if you do get sick, maybe my doctor friend can help you. His name is Chopper.
0-opponent_lost,alsoPlaying:human,saidMarker:manipulation1,notSaidMarker:manipulation1end,priority:302,marker:manipulation1end=smiling.png,S-see? It helped you, ~player~! And now ~name~ is the one that has to strip, hahah...
0-opponent_lost,alsoPlaying:human,saidMarker:manipulation1,notSaidMarker:manipulation1end,priority:302,marker:manipulation1end=calm.png,Hey, you didn't lose! You're welcome, ~player~. Now if only ~name~ knew about what I taught you...

0-opponent_lost,alsoPlaying:human,saidMarker:seduction_final,oneShotId:22,priority:301=sad.png,I see ~name~ lost this round. ~player~, do you still want to lose the next round for me?
0-opponent_lost,alsoPlaying:human,saidMarker:seduction1,notSaidMarker:seduction1end,priority:302,marker:seduction1end=smiling.png,Oh. Never mind, ~player~.

0-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:bounty_hunter,oneShotId:179,priority:240=smiling.png,S-so you're a bounty hunter, ~name~? You probably go after pirates all the time, huh? Good thing there isn't one here, so you can relax, heheh.
0-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:bounty_hunter,oneShotId:179,priority:240=shocked.png,(Crap! A bounty hunter. This is what I was worried about. I should be fine as long as I'm not recognized.)
0-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:cheerful,oneShotId:168,priority:225,one-shot-id:4=smiling.png,You're the life of this table, aren't you, ~name~?
0-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:cheerful,oneShotId:168,priority:225,one-shot-id:76=smiling.png,My, you're a cheerful one, aren't you? Nothing wrong with that.
0-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:exotic_hair,oneShotId:167=calm.png,I've met people with weird hairstyles, but wow...
0-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:exotic_hair,oneShotId:167=thinking.png,That's a very unique hairstyle you have. It would be quite easy to identify you with that.
0-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:fancy,oneShotId:172=greedy.png,You're rich, aren't you? You don't have to tell me. Are you looking for some new friends, ~name~?
0-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:fancy,oneShotId:172,one-shot-id:6=greedy.png,Those clothes... You must be rich, huh? I hope we can be friends, ~name~. For no reason in particular, heheh.
0-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:hero,oneShotId:166,priority:225=smiling.png,I can tell you're a good person, ~name~. I hope we can get along.
0-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:hero,oneShotId:166,priority:225,one-shot-id:2=calm.png,It seems to me your heart is in the right place. If I don't win this game, I hope you do. But I'm really gonna win!
0-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:musician,oneShotId:175,priority:240=smiling.png,You play music, ~name~? I wonder if you have anything to teach Brook. I doubt it, he's really good. Though I probably wouldn't say it to his face.
0-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:musician,oneShotId:175,priority:240=smiling.png,You're a musician, huh? My crew mate, Brook, plays... pretty much every instrument. And don't tell him I said this, but he's really good.
0-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:pirate,oneShotId:177,priority:240=smiling.png,So you're a pirate, huh? What's that like? I wouldn't know, because I'm not a pirate, heheh.
0-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:pirate,oneShotId:177,priority:240=shocked.png,(A pirate? It's not someone I know, so I better be careful about what I say.)
0-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:shy,oneShotId:237=greedy.png,Why did you come to play this game if you're so scared of losing? Oh, it must be because of the prize. I get you.
0-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:shy,oneShotId:237=sad.png,Aren't you a little too shy to play a game like this one? You should start with something easier, like regular poker.
0-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:very_long_hair,oneShotId:174,priority:220=thinking.png,How do you even take care of hair that long? Doesn't it get tangled everywhere?
0-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:very_long_hair,oneShotId:174,priority:220=thinking.png,I could never have hair that long. I'd probably trip on it everytime I walk.

0-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:weapon,oneShotId:169,priority:225=calm.png,I hope you have no intention of using that weapon, or there will be trouble. And I'll be out of here.
0-opponent_lost,hasHand:High Card,oneShotId:191=smiling.png,Uff, that was a close one. I thought I was losing this one.
0-opponent_lost,hasHand:High Card,oneShotId:191=smiling.png,Huh, what do you know? I didn't lose.
0-opponent_lost,hasHand:High Card,oneShotId:191=smiling.png,That was a close call, alright.
0-opponent_lost,target:chihiro,targetStage:0=sad.png,You look way too young and innocent. I'm not looking forward to seeing you lose, little girl.
0-opponent_lost,target:chihiro,targetStage:4=sad.png,Calm down, young lady. Breathe in, breathe out...
0-opponent_lost,target:chihiro,targetStage:5=serious.png,Ah, you finally came back. You owe us all an apology.
0-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:manipulation_final,oneShotId:68,marker:target2end=calm.png,Oh, you... lost? That's good, I was worried for your health, and... I'm sorry, that wasn't very nice of me.
0-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:manipulation_final,oneShotId:68,marker:target2end=sad.png,You actually lost? Is it because of what I said? M-maybe you won't really get sick, and... I'm sorry, I guess this is my fault.
0-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:manipulation1,notSaidMarker:manipulation1end,marker:manipulation1end=smiling.png,Whaaaat? That didn't work? Are you sure you did it right, ~player~? Try it again next round.
0-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:manipulation1,notSaidMarker:manipulation1end,marker:manipulation1end=calm.png,Oh, I can't believe that didn't work, ~player~! Are you sure you heard me right? Let me explain it to you again...
0-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:manipulation1,notSaidMarker:manipulation1end,marker:manipulation1end=smiling.png,Oh, I'm sorry my tip didn't help you, ~player~. It actually works 2 out of 3 times. If you try it again, I'm sure it will work!
0-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:seduction_final,oneShotId:15,marker:target1end=sad.png,Yes! Thank you, ~player~! Oh. Eh...
0-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:seduction_final,oneShotId:15,marker:target1end=sad.png,~Player~ lost! Yeah! Hmm...
0-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:seduction_final,oneShotId:15,marker:target1end=sad.png,Thank you, ~player~! You're the best, and you... lost. Uh...
0-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:seduction1,notSaidMarker:seduction1end,marker:seduction1end=smug.png,Thank you, ~player~! You're very kind.
0-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:seduction1,notSaidMarker:seduction1end,marker:seduction1end=smiling.png,You're so nice, ~player~! I like you even more now.
0-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:seduction1,notSaidMarker:seduction1end,marker:seduction1end=smiling.png,See? I knew you lose like a champion, ~player~.
0-opponent_lost,target:lucina,targetStage:0=calm.png,Why the mask? Are you hiding something? I guess we all have something to hide.
0-opponent_lost,target:lucina,targetStage:4=thinking.png,Now that I look at you closer, Lucina... Are your eyes different from each other? They're not exactly the same color...
0-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:2,one-shot-id:77=thinking.png,Uff, you can't catch a break, huh?
0-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:2,one-shot-id:78=thinking.png,~Name~, didn't you lose the last round too?
0-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:2,one-shot-id:79=thinking.png,You lost again? That sucks... for you.
0-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:2,one-shot-id:80=thinking.png,Maybe you should've reviewed the rules before playing a game, ~name~.
0-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:3-=shocked.png,You're on the express train to full nudity.
0-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:3-=sad.png,How many losses in a row does this make? I feel bad for you.
0-opponent_lost,timeInStage:7-,oneShotId:94=smiling.png,Wow! I keep winning round after round. It almost seems like... magic!
0-opponent_stripping,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mask_falls,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:embarrassed,id:60=shocked.png,What's wrong? Mika, it's just a mask. You were already showing everything.
0-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip=thinking.png,So why can't you take off your own clothes, ~name~? I'm just curious.
0-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip=serious.png,You seem perfectly capable of undressing yourself, ~name~. That's just my opinion.
0-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip=thinking.png,Doesn't it take longer to have someone else remove your clothes for you?
0-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip=calm.png,I assume your partner knows everything you're wearing, huh?
0-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip=thinking.png,This is one way to have your friend participate without playing the game, I suppose.
0-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip,oneShotId:184,priority:151=thinking.png,So your friend will help you getting naked? Okaaay...
0-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip,oneShotId:184,priority:151=thinking.png,I see. So so you'll get help undressing...?
0-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Oh, at least we won't have to wait for the reveal. Whatever it is...
0-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:3=thinking.png,You're taking off your gloves, but you're still holding on to your sword. Hmmm...
0-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:108,test:~clothing~:armor=sad.png,Wearing armor must be the worst. You can barely move, and it's so heavy... Plus, most of them don't even look fashionable.
0-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:108,test:~clothing~:armor=sad.png,How uncomfortable is it to wear armor? Sure, it can save your life, but is it really worth it?
0-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:186,test:~clothing~:belt=calm.png,Cool belt. Not as cool as mine, but it's still nice.
0-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:186,test:~clothing~:belt=calm.png,Hmmm, where did you get that belt? Want me to tell you where I got mine so you can get a better looking one?
0-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:102,test:~clothing~:boots=calm.png,Those are some nice boots. I used to wear mine a lot before I... joined my current crew.
0-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:102,test:~clothing~:boots=calm.png,Nice boots. I still have a pair or two, even though I don't wear them that much.
0-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:188,test:~clothing~:bracelets=calm.png,Do those bracelets have any significant value to you, ~name~? Mine has a lot of sentimental value. It's from my sister, Nojiko.
0-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:188,test:~clothing~:bracelets=calm.png,Are those bracelets important to you, ~name~? Mine sure is. My sister, Nojiko, gave it to me.
0-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:111,test:~clothing~:cape=thinking.png,I can't say I understand the point in wearing a cape. It must be so difficult to fight with that. What if it gets stuck in something?
0-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:111,test:~clothing~:cape=thinking.png,Why do you even wear a cape? Does it allow you to fly or something? I think it's a little too much.
0-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:106,test:~clothing~:gloves=serious.png,Now why would you wear gloves to a game of poker? Oh, because you knew you'd have to strip at one point and needed something extra to remove.
0-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:106,test:~clothing~:gloves=serious.png,Gloves would be the perfect piece of clothing to hide more cards in a game of poker. You just slip them right into your hand.
0-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:99,test:~clothing~:hat=smiling.png,My Captain has a hat. Do you also get super intense when someone takes it?
0-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:99,test:~clothing~:hat=smiling.png,If you're taking it off, I suppose that hat isn't very important for you. Like my Captain's hat.
0-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:107,test:~clothing~:necklace=greedy.png,That necklace... Is it valuable? I mean, real value. Not the sentimental kind.
0-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:107,test:~clothing~:necklace=greedy.png,Pretty necklace. And... expensive looking.
0-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:101,test:~clothing~:panties=serious.png,If Brook was here, he would be losing it now. Although his deal is seeing panties, not what's under them, isn't it? I really don't get it. Either way, he is a pervert.
0-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:101,test:~clothing~:panties=thinking.png,Panties are all Brook ever talks about. If he was here, would he be trying to steal them, or does he just want to see them?
0-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:101,test:~clothing~:panties=thinking.png,How many times have I punched Brook after he asks to see a girl's panties? I don't remember, but my knuckles hurt now.
0-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:110,test:~clothing~:scarf=smiling.png,I like scarves. Too bad I only get to wear one when I go to a winter island, or I'd look out of place.
0-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:110,test:~clothing~:scarf=smiling.png,Nice scarf, ~name~. I should get myself a similar one for the next time we sail to a winter island.
0-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:104,test:~clothing~:shoes=smug.png,No luck, no shoes, no prize! I'm joking, even without your shoes you can still win. But you won't!
0-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:104,test:~clothing~:shoes=smug.png,Be careful where you step now, ~name~. Because you're taking off your shoes, of course. I wasn't trying to threaten you, or something.
0-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:112,test:~clothing~:stockings=smiling.png,Aren't stockings nice? The perfect mix of sexy and cute.
0-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:112,test:~clothing~:stockings=smiling.png,Stocking are cute. Ah, so many adorable kind of clothing I could've worn for this game.
0-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:100,test:~clothing~:sword=thinking.png,Only one sword? I guess that's normal. Because of Zoro, I'm now used to people carrying around three swords.
0-opponent_stripped,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:embarrassed,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:putting_mask,id:61=sad.png,Wow. I guess you never really know a person's weakness until you see it.
0-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:197,count-role;target&character;human:,test:~clothing~:belt=smug.png,That's a boring belt; it doesn't even work as a holster. Relax, I'm just kidding.
0-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:197,count-role;target&character;human:,test:~clothing~:belt=thinking.png,Be careful your pants don't fall down without your belt.
0-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:197,count-role;target&character;human:,test:~clothing~:belt=smug.png,That belt came off very easy. Have you lost weight worrying about the game, ~player~?
0-opponent_stripped,filter:assisted_strip,oneShotId:185,priority:151=calm.png,Then you can't take off your own clothes? I've no problem with this, it just seems unnecessary.
0-opponent_stripped,filter:assisted_strip,oneShotId:185,priority:151=calm.png,This doesn't bother me, but I can't say I understand it.
0-opponent_stripped,target:human,targetStatus:lost_all,saidMarker:target1,oneShotId:12,marker:target1naked=smiling.png,Oh, now you're completely naked, ~player~. If you were to lose one more time...
0-opponent_stripped,target:human,targetStatus:lost_all,saidMarker:target1,oneShotId:12,marker:target1naked=serious.png,(One more loss, and ~player~ will be out of the game. I can do this.)
0-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:1,id:39=smiling.png,So you're a woman, huh? And you have a pretty face, that mask wasn't doing you any favors.
0-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:4=serious.png,Normally I'd be worried about something like that, but you don't seem like the kind of woman who'd use that sword unless there's a reason.
0-opponent_stripped,targetStatus:crotch_visible,totalExposed:1,oneShotId:23=shocked.png,Part of me was hoping the "getting naked" part of this game was just a bluff.
0-opponent_stripped,targetStatus:crotch_visible,totalExposed:1,oneShotId:23=sad.png,Suddenly, this game feels a lot more real.
0-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:109,test:~clothing~:armor=smiling.png,Oh, not in your case, ~name~. Your armor looks great on you.
0-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:109,test:~clothing~:armor=smiling.png,Oh, but I'm not talking about your armor, ~name~. This one looks so good that it's a shame to see it go.
0-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:187,test:~clothing~:belt=smug.png,And my belt doubles as a holster for my Clima-Tact too. Now that's really cool.
0-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:187,test:~clothing~:belt=calm.png,I can also keep my Clima-Tact in my belt. What about yours, ~name~?
0-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:147,test:~clothing~:boots=thinking.png,Now I only have to wear boots when I go to a winter island, especially if it's winter there too. The rest of the time, it's not that cold.
0-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:147,test:~clothing~:boots=thinking.png,We don't sail to that many cold islands, so I can wear sandals most of the time.
0-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:189,test:~clothing~:bracelets=serious.png,I hope the staff here knows how to save our valuable items. Because if anything happens to my possessions I'll make them pay.
0-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:189,test:~clothing~:bracelets=serious.png,Who's in charge of protecting the items we remove while we continue playing? They better be qualified.
0-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:148,test:~clothing~:cape=serious.png,I suppose they look cool, but I've never cared for that. Only the guys freak out over stuff like that.
0-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:148,test:~clothing~:cape=serious.png,The guys in my crew always freak out over stuff that looks cool, but is kind of pointless. Like capes.
0-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:198,test:~clothing~:glasses=smiling.png,Will you be able to see the cards without your glasses? Or that I'm cheating? Hahah, that's a joke, I'm not cheating. Not that you'll be able to tell without glasses.
0-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:198,test:~clothing~:glasses=serious.png,Are those glasses necessary for your eyes, or just for show? You didn't seem to have much of a problem with taking them off.
0-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:198,test:~clothing~:glasses=seductive.png,Without glasses I can see you have nice eyes, ~player~.
0-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:149,test:~clothing~:gloves=smug.png,From now on, I'm gonna be watching your hands,  ~name~. I mean your actual hands, not your cards.
0-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:149,test:~clothing~:gloves=thinking.png,If your hands get cold, you're gonna regret taking off your gloves.
0-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:199,test:~clothing~:gloves=serious.png,Who wears gloves to a poker game? Sketchy people, that's who.
0-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:199,test:~clothing~:gloves=thinking.png,Why wear gloves to this game? Do you bite your nails and you didn't want us to see?
0-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:199,test:~clothing~:gloves=smug.png,Do you bite your nails, ~player~? You have reason to be nervous, so it makes sense.
0-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:150,test:~clothing~:hat=embarrassed.png,But he does let me hold on to it every now and then. I guess he trusts me.
0-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:150,test:~clothing~:hat=embarrassed.png,And then when something happens to it, he comes crying to me to fix it. It's kind of adorable, I'll admit.
0-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:200,test:~clothing~:hat=calm.png,Your hair got all messy when you removed your hat. Do you want a comb, ~player~?
0-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:200,test:~clothing~:hat=greedy.png,Awww, I was kinda hoping you kept something hidden under your hat. Like your money...
0-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:200,test:~clothing~:hat=thinking.png,If Luffy was playing strip poker, would he take off his hat? Eh... I don't know why that thought entered my head.
0-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:201,test:~clothing~:headphones=furious.png,You weren't listening to music with those headphones, right? It would mean you've been ignoring everything I've been saying this whole time.
0-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:201,test:~clothing~:headphones=smiling.png,Nice headphones. What kind of music do you listen to, ~player~?
0-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:201,test:~clothing~:headphones=serious.png,You've not been using those headphones for cheating, have you? Like for getting tips from a friend, or something? Hmmm...
0-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:203,test:~clothing~:kilt=thinking.png,So you wear a skirt... Are you an okama, ~player~?
0-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:203,test:~clothing~:kilt=thinking.png,I don't think I've seen a man wearing a skirt before. Well, unless you count the okama.
0-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:203,test:~clothing~:kilt=smiling.png,You must be a confident guy to wear a skirt. I mean, you must be proud of your legs.
0-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:151,test:~clothing~:necklace=smug.png,Stealing a necklace is not that hard... Eh? Who said that?
0-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:151,test:~clothing~:necklace=smug.png,You better hope your necklace is not too expensive. For no reason...
0-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:204,test:~clothing~:necklace=greedy.png,That necklace looks valuable. How expensive is it, ~player~? Eh... I just would like to buy one.
0-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:204,test:~clothing~:necklace=greedy.png,Is that stone on your necklace real, ~player~? It looks big.
0-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:204,test:~clothing~:necklace=greedy.png,Is that necklace a family jewel or something, ~player~? Cause if it doesn't have sentimental value...
0-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:152,test:~clothing~:scarf=thinking.png,But they really are fashionable, aren't they?
0-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:152,test:~clothing~:scarf=calm.png,But still, scarves are cute.
0-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:105,test:~clothing~:shoes=thinking.png,I've really gotten in the habit of wearing open-toed shoes recently. Maybe I should go shopping for new shoes soon...
0-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:105,test:~clothing~:shoes=annoyed.png,Now I always wear sandals or open-toed shoes. Too bad it always attracts the feet guys. I've never understood that fixation.
0-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:153,test:~clothing~:stockings=seductive.png,I doubt any men can resist a woman wearing stockings.
0-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:153,test:~clothing~:stockings=seductive.png,Stockings are irresistible. I should wear them more.
0-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:202,test:~clothing~:tie=smug.png,Look at you, Big Shot. Taking off your tie. Now you're just an average player.
0-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:202,test:~clothing~:tie=thinking.png,Aren't you thinking you'll look less professional without your tie.
0-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:202,test:~clothing~:tie=calm.png,Oh, I liked the tie. It really made you look like you knew what you were doing.
0-opponent_stripped,target:human,targetStatus:lost_all,saidMarker:target2,oneShotId:65,test:~target.gender~:female,marker:target2naked=thinking.png,(Hmmm, so ~player~ is now fully naked. Which means she only has to lose once more to be out. How am I going to do this?)
0-opponent_stripped,target:human,targetStatus:lost_all,saidMarker:target2,oneShotId:65,test:~target.gender~:female,marker:target2naked=thinking.png,(One more loss for ~player~, and she'll be out. Maybe I can "help" her with that. I don't want to do this to a woman, but this is about survival.)

0-opponent_chest_will_be_visible,target:chihiro,id:41=shocked.png,Hey, where are you going? Huh?
0-opponent_chest_will_be_visible,target:lucina=serious.png,Come on, this isn't a big deal. I'm sure you've faced more dire situations than this one.
0-opponent_chest_is_visible,target:chihiro=serious.png,Hey, you can't replace yourself with... whatever that device is. It clearly isn't a Den Den Mushi. Either way, that's against the rules.
0-opponent_chest_is_visible,target:lucina=smiling.png,Well, if you're a warrior, bigger breasts probably wouldn't help you at all.

0-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:180=serious.png,Why do you want to show your body so much? And why do you assume we want to see it?
0-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:shy,oneShotId:164=sad.png,Don't be so scared, ~name~. I wish I could do something for you, but...
0-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:shy,oneShotId:164=sad.png,I feel so bad for ~name~. This is not something one should be forced to do unless you want to.
0-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:shy,oneShotId:164=calm.png,You're confronting your fear, ~name~. I believe in you.
0-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chihiro=sad.png,I understand you're scared, but don't run away again, okay?
0-opponent_crotch_is_visible,target:chihiro,id:1=shocked.png,You're a guy? But you look so girly... I'm sorry, this just really caught me by surprise.
0-opponent_crotch_is_visible,target:chihiro,id:1=shocked.png,Oh, I didn't see this coming. You really look like a girl...
0-opponent_start_masturbating,target:human,saidMarker:target1end,oneShotId:16=calm.png,~Player~, I, eh... wasn't serious about what I said. I was using you to win the game. I'm really sorry, I promise I'll make it up to you after I win the game.
0-opponent_start_masturbating,target:human,saidMarker:target1end,oneShotId:16=calm.png,I have a confession. I was seducing you so I would have a better chance of winning the game. I'm really sorry, ~player~. But your sacrifice won't be in vain if I win. I promise you I won't forget.
0-opponent_start_masturbating,target:human,saidMarker:target2end,oneShotId:70=calm.png,I'll make it up to you, ~player~. Not with money, of course. Maybe I can get Sanji to cook you something, or...
0-opponent_start_masturbating,target:human,saidMarker:target2end,oneShotId:70=calm.png,Maybe I can do something for you, ~player~. Something other than giving you the prize, of course.  I could get Usopp to make something for you? Nah, that's too lame.
0-opponent_start_masturbating,target:lucina=shocked.png,Are you praying? You know the punishment for losing the game is a little different, right?
0-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:lucina,targetTimeInStage:0-,targetSaidMarker:finished,targetSayingMarker:sit_on_crate=shocked.png,Did you just yell out Robin? Oh, I guess that's a different Robin. Sorry, I have a friend named Robin too, so I got confused for second.

1-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:weapon,oneShotId:169,priority:225=thinking.png,Why would you even bring a weapon to a poker game? Oh, I did bring my Clima-Tact, heheh...
1-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:weapon,oneShotId:169,priority:225=calm.png,I hope you have no intention of using that weapon, or there will be trouble. And I'll be out of here.
1-opponent_lost,hasHand:High Card,oneShotId:191=smiling.png,Uff, that was a close one. I thought I was losing this one.
1-opponent_lost,hasHand:High Card,oneShotId:191=smiling.png,Huh, what do you know? I didn't lose.
1-opponent_lost,hasHand:High Card,oneShotId:191=smiling.png,That was a close call, alright.
1-opponent_lost,target:chihiro,targetStage:0=sad.png,You look way too young and innocent. I'm not looking forward to seeing you lose, little girl.
1-opponent_lost,target:chihiro,targetStage:4=sad.png,Calm down, young lady. Breathe in, breathe out...
1-opponent_lost,target:chihiro,targetStage:5=serious.png,Ah, you finally came back. You owe us all an apology.
1-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:manipulation_final,oneShotId:68,marker:target2end=calm.png,Oh, you... lost? That's good, I was worried for your health, and... I'm sorry, that wasn't very nice of me.
1-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:manipulation_final,oneShotId:68,marker:target2end=sad.png,You actually lost? Is it because of what I said? M-maybe you won't really get sick, and... I'm sorry, I guess this is my fault.
1-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:seduction_final,oneShotId:15,marker:target1end=sad.png,Yes! Thank you, ~player~! Oh. Eh...
1-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:seduction_final,oneShotId:15,marker:target1end=sad.png,~Player~ lost! Yeah! Hmm...
1-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:seduction_final,oneShotId:15,marker:target1end=sad.png,Thank you, ~player~! You're the best, and you... lost. Uh...
1-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:seduction2,notSaidMarker:seduction2end,oneShotId:7,marker:seduction2end=greedy.png,I'm one step closer to victory! Oh, yeah, yeah... You can strip, ~player~,
1-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:seduction2,notSaidMarker:seduction2end,oneShotId:7,marker:seduction2end=happy.png,Heheheh, it worked!
1-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:seduction2,notSaidMarker:seduction2end,oneShotId:7,marker:seduction2end=smiling.png,Oh, thank you, ~player~! You're a delight.
1-opponent_lost,target:lucina,targetStage:0=calm.png,Why the mask? Are you hiding something? I guess we all have something to hide.
1-opponent_lost,target:lucina,targetStage:4=thinking.png,Now that I look at you closer, Lucina... Are your eyes different from each other? They're not exactly the same color...
1-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:2,one-shot-id:77=thinking.png,Uff, you can't catch a break, huh?
1-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:2,one-shot-id:78=thinking.png,~Name~, didn't you lose the last round too?
1-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:2,one-shot-id:79=thinking.png,You lost again? That sucks... for you.
1-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:2,one-shot-id:80=thinking.png,Maybe you should've reviewed the rules before playing a game, ~name~.
1-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:3-=shocked.png,You're on the express train to full nudity.
1-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:3-=sad.png,How many losses in a row does this make? I feel bad for you.
1-opponent_lost,timeInStage:7-,oneShotId:94=smiling.png,Wow! I keep winning round after round. It almost seems like... magic!
1-opponent_stripping,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mask_falls,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:embarrassed,id:60=shocked.png,What's wrong? Mika, it's just a mask. You were already showing everything.
1-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip=thinking.png,So why can't you take off your own clothes, ~name~? I'm just curious.
1-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip=serious.png,You seem perfectly capable of undressing yourself, ~name~. That's just my opinion.
1-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip=thinking.png,Doesn't it take longer to have someone else remove your clothes for you?
1-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip=calm.png,I assume your partner knows everything you're wearing, huh?
1-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip=thinking.png,This is one way to have your friend participate without playing the game, I suppose.
1-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip,oneShotId:184,priority:151=thinking.png,So your friend will help you getting naked? Okaaay...
1-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip,oneShotId:184,priority:151=thinking.png,I see. So so you'll get help undressing...?
1-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Oh, at least we won't have to wait for the reveal. Whatever it is...
1-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:3=thinking.png,You're taking off your gloves, but you're still holding on to your sword. Hmmm...
1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:108,test:~clothing~:armor=sad.png,Wearing armor must be the worst. You can barely move, and it's so heavy... Plus, most of them don't even look fashionable.
1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:108,test:~clothing~:armor=sad.png,How uncomfortable is it to wear armor? Sure, it can save your life, but is it really worth it?
1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:186,test:~clothing~:belt=calm.png,Cool belt. Not as cool as mine, but it's still nice.
1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:186,test:~clothing~:belt=calm.png,Hmmm, where did you get that belt? Want me to tell you where I got mine so you can get a better looking one?
1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:102,test:~clothing~:boots=calm.png,Those are some nice boots. I used to wear mine a lot before I... joined my current crew.
1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:102,test:~clothing~:boots=calm.png,Nice boots. I still have a pair or two, even though I don't wear them that much.
1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:188,test:~clothing~:bracelets=calm.png,Do those bracelets have any significant value to you, ~name~? Mine has a lot of sentimental value. It's from my sister, Nojiko.
1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:188,test:~clothing~:bracelets=calm.png,Are those bracelets important to you, ~name~? Mine sure is. My sister, Nojiko, gave it to me.
1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:111,test:~clothing~:cape=thinking.png,I can't say I understand the point in wearing a cape. It must be so difficult to fight with that. What if it gets stuck in something?
1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:111,test:~clothing~:cape=thinking.png,Why do you even wear a cape? Does it allow you to fly or something? I think it's a little too much.
1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:106,test:~clothing~:gloves=serious.png,Now why would you wear gloves to a game of poker? Oh, because you knew you'd have to strip at one point and needed something extra to remove.
1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:106,test:~clothing~:gloves=serious.png,Gloves would be the perfect piece of clothing to hide more cards in a game of poker. You just slip them right into your hand.
1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:99,test:~clothing~:hat=smiling.png,My Captain has a hat. Do you also get super intense when someone takes it?
1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:99,test:~clothing~:hat=smiling.png,If you're taking it off, I suppose that hat isn't very important for you. Like my Captain's hat.
1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:107,test:~clothing~:necklace=greedy.png,That necklace... Is it valuable? I mean, real value. Not the sentimental kind.
1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:107,test:~clothing~:necklace=greedy.png,Pretty necklace. And... expensive looking.
1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:101,test:~clothing~:panties=serious.png,If Brook was here, he would be losing it now. Although his deal is seeing panties, not what's under them, isn't it? I really don't get it. Either way, he is a pervert.
1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:101,test:~clothing~:panties=thinking.png,Panties are all Brook ever talks about. If he was here, would he be trying to steal them, or does he just want to see them?
1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:101,test:~clothing~:panties=thinking.png,How many times have I punched Brook after he asks to see a girl's panties? I don't remember, but my knuckles hurt now.
1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:110,test:~clothing~:scarf=smiling.png,I like scarves. Too bad I only get to wear one when I go to a winter island, or I'd look out of place.
1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:110,test:~clothing~:scarf=smiling.png,Nice scarf, ~name~. I should get myself a similar one for the next time we sail to a winter island.
1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:104,test:~clothing~:shoes=smug.png,No luck, no shoes, no prize! I'm joking, even without your shoes you can still win. But you won't!
1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:104,test:~clothing~:shoes=smug.png,Be careful where you step now, ~name~. Because you're taking off your shoes, of course. I wasn't trying to threaten you, or something.
1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:112,test:~clothing~:stockings=smiling.png,Aren't stockings nice? The perfect mix of sexy and cute.
1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:112,test:~clothing~:stockings=smiling.png,Stocking are cute. Ah, so many adorable kind of clothing I could've worn for this game.
1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:100,test:~clothing~:sword=thinking.png,Only one sword? I guess that's normal. Because of Zoro, I'm now used to people carrying around three swords.
1-opponent_stripped,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:embarrassed,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:putting_mask,id:61=sad.png,Wow. I guess you never really know a person's weakness until you see it.
1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:197,count-role;target&character;human:,test:~clothing~:belt=smug.png,That's a boring belt; it doesn't even work as a holster. Relax, I'm just kidding.
1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:197,count-role;target&character;human:,test:~clothing~:belt=thinking.png,Be careful your pants don't fall down without your belt.
1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:197,count-role;target&character;human:,test:~clothing~:belt=smug.png,That belt came off very easy. Have you lost weight worrying about the game, ~player~?
1-opponent_stripped,filter:assisted_strip,oneShotId:185,priority:151=calm.png,Then you can't take off your own clothes? I've no problem with this, it just seems unnecessary.
1-opponent_stripped,filter:assisted_strip,oneShotId:185,priority:151=calm.png,This doesn't bother me, but I can't say I understand it.
1-opponent_stripped,target:human,targetStatus:lost_all,saidMarker:target1,oneShotId:12,marker:target1naked=smiling.png,Oh, now you're completely naked, ~player~. If you were to lose one more time...
1-opponent_stripped,target:human,targetStatus:lost_all,saidMarker:target1,oneShotId:12,marker:target1naked=serious.png,(One more loss, and ~player~ will be out of the game. I can do this.)
1-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:1,id:39=smiling.png,So you're a woman, huh? And you have a pretty face, that mask wasn't doing you any favors.
1-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:4=serious.png,Normally I'd be worried about something like that, but you don't seem like the kind of woman who'd use that sword unless there's a reason.
1-opponent_stripped,targetStatus:crotch_visible,totalExposed:1,oneShotId:23=shocked.png,Part of me was hoping the "getting naked" part of this game was just a bluff.
1-opponent_stripped,targetStatus:crotch_visible,totalExposed:1,oneShotId:23=sad.png,Suddenly, this game feels a lot more real.
1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:109,test:~clothing~:armor=smiling.png,Oh, not in your case, ~name~. Your armor looks great on you.
1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:109,test:~clothing~:armor=smiling.png,Oh, but I'm not talking about your armor, ~name~. This one looks so good that it's a shame to see it go.
1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:187,test:~clothing~:belt=smug.png,And my belt doubles as a holster for my Clima-Tact too. Now that's really cool.
1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:187,test:~clothing~:belt=calm.png,I can also keep my Clima-Tact in my belt. What about yours, ~name~?
1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:147,test:~clothing~:boots=thinking.png,Now I only have to wear boots when I go to a winter island, especially if it's winter there too. The rest of the time, it's not that cold.
1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:147,test:~clothing~:boots=thinking.png,We don't sail to that many cold islands, so I can wear sandals most of the time.
1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:189,test:~clothing~:bracelets=serious.png,I hope the staff here knows how to save our valuable items. Because if anything happens to my possessions I'll make them pay.
1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:189,test:~clothing~:bracelets=serious.png,Who's in charge of protecting the items we remove while we continue playing? They better be qualified.
1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:148,test:~clothing~:cape=serious.png,I suppose they look cool, but I've never cared for that. Only the guys freak out over stuff like that.
1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:148,test:~clothing~:cape=serious.png,The guys in my crew always freak out over stuff that looks cool, but is kind of pointless. Like capes.
1-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:198,test:~clothing~:glasses=smiling.png,Will you be able to see the cards without your glasses? Or that I'm cheating? Hahah, that's a joke, I'm not cheating. Not that you'll be able to tell without glasses.
1-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:198,test:~clothing~:glasses=serious.png,Are those glasses necessary for your eyes, or just for show? You didn't seem to have much of a problem with taking them off.
1-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:198,test:~clothing~:glasses=seductive.png,Without glasses I can see you have nice eyes, ~player~.
1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:149,test:~clothing~:gloves=smug.png,From now on, I'm gonna be watching your hands,  ~name~. I mean your actual hands, not your cards.
1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:149,test:~clothing~:gloves=thinking.png,If your hands get cold, you're gonna regret taking off your gloves.
1-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:199,test:~clothing~:gloves=serious.png,Who wears gloves to a poker game? Sketchy people, that's who.
1-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:199,test:~clothing~:gloves=thinking.png,Why wear gloves to this game? Do you bite your nails and you didn't want us to see?
1-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:199,test:~clothing~:gloves=smug.png,Do you bite your nails, ~player~? You have reason to be nervous, so it makes sense.
1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:150,test:~clothing~:hat=embarrassed.png,But he does let me hold on to it every now and then. I guess he trusts me.
1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:150,test:~clothing~:hat=embarrassed.png,And then when something happens to it, he comes crying to me to fix it. It's kind of adorable, I'll admit.
1-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:200,test:~clothing~:hat=calm.png,Your hair got all messy when you removed your hat. Do you want a comb, ~player~?
1-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:200,test:~clothing~:hat=greedy.png,Awww, I was kinda hoping you kept something hidden under your hat. Like your money...
1-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:200,test:~clothing~:hat=thinking.png,If Luffy was playing strip poker, would he take off his hat? Eh... I don't know why that thought entered my head.
1-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:201,test:~clothing~:headphones=furious.png,You weren't listening to music with those headphones, right? It would mean you've been ignoring everything I've been saying this whole time.
1-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:201,test:~clothing~:headphones=smiling.png,Nice headphones. What kind of music do you listen to, ~player~?
1-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:201,test:~clothing~:headphones=serious.png,You've not been using those headphones for cheating, have you? Like for getting tips from a friend, or something? Hmmm...
1-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:203,test:~clothing~:kilt=thinking.png,So you wear a skirt... Are you an okama, ~player~?
1-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:203,test:~clothing~:kilt=thinking.png,I don't think I've seen a man wearing a skirt before. Well, unless you count the okama.
1-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:203,test:~clothing~:kilt=smiling.png,You must be a confident guy to wear a skirt. I mean, you must be proud of your legs.
1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:151,test:~clothing~:necklace=smug.png,Stealing a necklace is not that hard... Eh? Who said that?
1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:151,test:~clothing~:necklace=smug.png,You better hope your necklace is not too expensive. For no reason...
1-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:204,test:~clothing~:necklace=greedy.png,That necklace looks valuable. How expensive is it, ~player~? Eh... I just would like to buy one.
1-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:204,test:~clothing~:necklace=greedy.png,Is that stone on your necklace real, ~player~? It looks big.
1-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:204,test:~clothing~:necklace=greedy.png,Is that necklace a family jewel or something, ~player~? Cause if it doesn't have sentimental value...
1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:152,test:~clothing~:scarf=thinking.png,But they really are fashionable, aren't they?
1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:152,test:~clothing~:scarf=calm.png,But still, scarves are cute.
1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:105,test:~clothing~:shoes=thinking.png,I've really gotten in the habit of wearing open-toed shoes recently. Maybe I should go shopping for new shoes soon...
1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:105,test:~clothing~:shoes=annoyed.png,Now I always wear sandals or open-toed shoes. Too bad it always attracts the feet guys. I've never understood that fixation.
1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:153,test:~clothing~:stockings=seductive.png,I doubt any men can resist a woman wearing stockings.
1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:153,test:~clothing~:stockings=seductive.png,Stockings are irresistible. I should wear them more.
1-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:202,test:~clothing~:tie=smug.png,Look at you, Big Shot. Taking off your tie. Now you're just an average player.
1-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:202,test:~clothing~:tie=thinking.png,Aren't you thinking you'll look less professional without your tie.
1-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:202,test:~clothing~:tie=calm.png,Oh, I liked the tie. It really made you look like you knew what you were doing.
1-opponent_stripped,target:human,targetStatus:lost_all,saidMarker:target2,oneShotId:65,test:~target.gender~:female,marker:target2naked=thinking.png,(Hmmm, so ~player~ is now fully naked. Which means she only has to lose once more to be out. How am I going to do this?)
1-opponent_stripped,target:human,targetStatus:lost_all,saidMarker:target2,oneShotId:65,test:~target.gender~:female,marker:target2naked=thinking.png,(One more loss for ~player~, and she'll be out. Maybe I can "help" her with that. I don't want to do this to a woman, but this is about survival.)
1-opponent_stripped,target:human,targetStatus:lost_all,saidMarker:target2,oneShotId:63,test:~target.gender~:male,marker:target2naked=thinking.png,(Hmmm, so ~player~ is now fully naked. Which means he only has to lose once more to be out. How am I going to do this?)
1-opponent_stripped,target:human,targetStatus:lost_all,saidMarker:target2,oneShotId:63,test:~target.gender~:male,marker:target2naked=thinking.png,(One more loss for ~player~, and he'll be out. Maybe I can "help" him with that. I'm not happy about it, but it's my only choice.)
1-opponent_chest_will_be_visible,target:chihiro,id:41=shocked.png,Hey, where are you going? Huh?
1-opponent_chest_will_be_visible,target:lucina=serious.png,Come on, this isn't a big deal. I'm sure you've faced more dire situations than this one.
1-opponent_chest_is_visible,target:chihiro=serious.png,Hey, you can't replace yourself with... whatever that device is. It clearly isn't a Den Den Mushi. Either way, that's against the rules.
1-opponent_chest_is_visible,target:lucina=smiling.png,Well, if you're a warrior, bigger breasts probably wouldn't help you at all.
1-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:confident,oneShotId:113=serious.png,This is the moment your confidence is really put to the test, ~name~.
1-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:confident,oneShotId:113=serious.png,You seem pretty confident, ~name~. But still...
1-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:180=serious.png,Do you actually want to be naked? I don't get it.
1-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:180=serious.png,Why do you want to show your body so much? And why do you assume we want to see it?
1-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:shy,oneShotId:164=sad.png,Don't be so scared, ~name~. I wish I could do something for you, but...
1-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:shy,oneShotId:164=sad.png,I feel so bad for ~name~. This is not something one should be forced to do unless you want to.
1-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:shy,oneShotId:164=calm.png,You're confronting your fear, ~name~. I believe in you.
1-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chihiro=sad.png,I understand you're scared, but don't run away again, okay?
1-opponent_crotch_is_visible,target:chihiro,id:1=shocked.png,You're a guy? But you look so girly... I'm sorry, this just really caught me by surprise.
1-opponent_crotch_is_visible,target:chihiro,id:1=shocked.png,Oh, I didn't see this coming. You really look like a girl...
1-opponent_start_masturbating,target:human,saidMarker:target1end,oneShotId:16=calm.png,~Player~, I, eh... wasn't serious about what I said. I was using you to win the game. I'm really sorry, I promise I'll make it up to you after I win the game.
1-opponent_start_masturbating,target:human,saidMarker:target1end,oneShotId:16=calm.png,I have a confession. I was seducing you so I would have a better chance of winning the game. I'm really sorry, ~player~. But your sacrifice won't be in vain if I win. I promise you I won't forget.
1-opponent_start_masturbating,target:human,saidMarker:target2end,oneShotId:70=calm.png,I'll make it up to you, ~player~. Not with money, of course. Maybe I can get Sanji to cook you something, or...
1-opponent_start_masturbating,target:human,saidMarker:target2end,oneShotId:70=calm.png,Maybe I can do something for you, ~player~. Something other than giving you the prize, of course.  I could get Usopp to make something for you? Nah, that's too lame.
1-opponent_start_masturbating,target:lucina=shocked.png,Are you praying? You know the punishment for losing the game is a little different, right?
1-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:lucina,targetTimeInStage:0-,targetSaidMarker:finished,targetSayingMarker:sit_on_crate=shocked.png,Did you just yell out Robin? Oh, I guess that's a different Robin. Sorry, I have a friend named Robin too, so I got confused for second.

2-opponent_lost,alsoPlaying:human,saidMarker:manipulation_final,oneShotId:69,priority:301,marker:target2end=sad.png,Oh, so you didn't lose, ~player~? Did you hear what I said? I'm just worried for your health. Well, if you do get sick, maybe my doctor friend can help you. His name is Chopper.
2-opponent_lost,alsoPlaying:human,saidMarker:manipulation3,notSaidMarker:manipulation3end,oneShotId:47,priority:302,marker:manipulation3end=serious.png,Oh, I didn't lose. But I have ~name~ to thank for that. Not you, ~player~.

2-opponent_lost,alsoPlaying:human,saidMarker:seduction3,notSaidMarker:seduction3end,oneShotId:30,priority:302,marker:seduction3end=smiling.png,Hey, ~name~ lost! I only promised to kiss you if <i>you</i> lost, ~player~. So I guess I don't owe you anything, heheh.
2-opponent_lost,alsoPlaying:human,saidMarker:seduction3,notSaidMarker:seduction3end,oneShotId:30,priority:302,marker:seduction3end=smiling.png,Nice, I'm saved! Too bad it wasn't you who lost, ~player~. You would've earned a nice kiss from me.
2-opponent_lost,alsoPlaying:human,saidMarker:seduction3,notSaidMarker:seduction3end,oneShotId:30,priority:302,marker:seduction3end=calm.png,Oh, ~name~ lost. And I was so looking forward to kissing ~player~. But it wasn't you who lost, so...
2-opponent_lost,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:1-,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mask,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:mask_falls,id:59=calm.png,Hey, Mika, your mask fell off. Oh, you have a pretty face.
2-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:bounty_hunter,oneShotId:179,priority:240=smiling.png,S-so you're a bounty hunter, ~name~? You probably go after pirates all the time, huh? Good thing there isn't one here, so you can relax, heheh.
2-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:bounty_hunter,oneShotId:179,priority:240=shocked.png,(Crap! A bounty hunter. This is what I was worried about. I should be fine as long as I'm not recognized.)
2-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:cheerful,oneShotId:168,priority:225,one-shot-id:4=smiling.png,You're the life of this table, aren't you, ~name~?
2-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:cheerful,oneShotId:168,priority:225,one-shot-id:76=smiling.png,My, you're a cheerful one, aren't you? Nothing wrong with that.
2-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:exotic_hair,oneShotId:167=calm.png,I've met people with weird hairstyles, but wow...
2-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:exotic_hair,oneShotId:167=thinking.png,That's a very unique hairstyle you have. It would be quite easy to identify you with that.
2-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:fancy,oneShotId:172=greedy.png,You're rich, aren't you? You don't have to tell me. Are you looking for some new friends, ~name~?
2-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:fancy,oneShotId:172,one-shot-id:6=greedy.png,Those clothes... You must be rich, huh? I hope we can be friends, ~name~. For no reason in particular, heheh.
2-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:hero,oneShotId:166,priority:225=smiling.png,I can tell you're a good person, ~name~. I hope we can get along.
2-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:hero,oneShotId:166,priority:225,one-shot-id:2=calm.png,It seems to me your heart is in the right place. If I don't win this game, I hope you do. But I'm really gonna win!
2-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:musician,oneShotId:175,priority:240=smiling.png,You play music, ~name~? I wonder if you have anything to teach Brook. I doubt it, he's really good. Though I probably wouldn't say it to his face.
2-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:musician,oneShotId:175,priority:240=smiling.png,You're a musician, huh? My crew mate, Brook, plays... pretty much every instrument. And don't tell him I said this, but he's really good.
2-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:pirate,oneShotId:177,priority:240=smiling.png,So you're a pirate, huh? What's that like? I wouldn't know, because I'm not a pirate, heheh.
2-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:pirate,oneShotId:177,priority:240=shocked.png,(A pirate? It's not someone I know, so I better be careful about what I say.)
2-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:shy,oneShotId:237=greedy.png,Why did you come to play this game if you're so scared of losing? Oh, it must be because of the prize. I get you.
2-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:shy,oneShotId:237=sad.png,Aren't you a little too shy to play a game like this one? You should start with something easier, like regular poker.
2-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:very_long_hair,oneShotId:174,priority:220=thinking.png,How do you even take care of hair that long? Doesn't it get tangled everywhere?
2-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:very_long_hair,oneShotId:174,priority:220=thinking.png,I could never have hair that long. I'd probably trip on it everytime I walk.
2-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:villain,oneShotId:173,priority:235=serious.png,(I have a feeling this person is bad news. I better watch out.)
2-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:villain,oneShotId:173,priority:235=serious.png,(There's something about ~name~ I just don't like. But I better be careful not to say anything to indicate that.)
2-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:weapon,oneShotId:169,priority:225=thinking.png,Why would you even bring a weapon to a poker game? Oh, I did bring my Clima-Tact, heheh...
2-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:weapon,oneShotId:169,priority:225=calm.png,I hope you have no intention of using that weapon, or there will be trouble. And I'll be out of here.
2-opponent_lost,hasHand:High Card,oneShotId:191=smiling.png,Uff, that was a close one. I thought I was losing this one.
2-opponent_lost,hasHand:High Card,oneShotId:191=smiling.png,Huh, what do you know? I didn't lose.
2-opponent_lost,hasHand:High Card,oneShotId:191=smiling.png,That was a close call, alright.
2-opponent_lost,target:chihiro,targetStage:0=sad.png,You look way too young and innocent. I'm not looking forward to seeing you lose, little girl.
2-opponent_lost,target:chihiro,targetStage:4=sad.png,Calm down, young lady. Breathe in, breathe out...
2-opponent_lost,target:chihiro,targetStage:5=serious.png,Ah, you finally came back. You owe us all an apology.
2-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:manipulation_final,oneShotId:68,marker:target2end=calm.png,Oh, you... lost? That's good, I was worried for your health, and... I'm sorry, that wasn't very nice of me.
2-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:manipulation_final,oneShotId:68,marker:target2end=sad.png,You actually lost? Is it because of what I said? M-maybe you won't really get sick, and... I'm sorry, I guess this is my fault.
2-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:manipulation3,notSaidMarker:manipulation3end,oneShotId:46,marker:manipulation3end=happy.png,Yes! You actually have a good heart, ~player~. You're... not bad.
2-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:manipulation3,notSaidMarker:manipulation3end,oneShotId:46,marker:manipulation3end=greedy.png,Excellent! I can't wait to get that money... S-so I can share it, of course.
2-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:manipulation3,notSaidMarker:manipulation3end,oneShotId:46,marker:manipulation3end=happy.png,Oh, thank you, ~player~! The orphanage will not forget your kindness. Or was it the hospital? Well, whatever I just said.
2-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:seduction_final,oneShotId:15,marker:target1end=sad.png,Yes! Thank you, ~player~! Oh. Eh...
2-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:seduction_final,oneShotId:15,marker:target1end=sad.png,~Player~ lost! Yeah! Hmm...
2-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:seduction_final,oneShotId:15,marker:target1end=sad.png,Thank you, ~player~! You're the best, and you... lost. Uh...
2-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:seduction3,notSaidMarker:seduction3end,oneShotId:29,marker:seduction3end=thinking.png,Hmm, did I just promise something? Oh, cool! I didn't lose.
2-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:seduction3,notSaidMarker:seduction3end,oneShotId:29,marker:seduction3end=smiling.png,Thank you, ~player~! You're so nice. I'll give you that kiss after the game. We have to stay focused, after all.
2-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:seduction3,notSaidMarker:seduction3end,oneShotId:29,marker:seduction3end=happy.png,Yes! Oh, I did say I would give you a kiss, ~player~. But I have to put my lipstick on first. Now where did I leave it...?
2-opponent_lost,target:lucina,targetStage:0=calm.png,Why the mask? Are you hiding something? I guess we all have something to hide.
2-opponent_lost,target:lucina,targetStage:4=thinking.png,Now that I look at you closer, Lucina... Are your eyes different from each other? They're not exactly the same color...
2-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:2,one-shot-id:77=thinking.png,Uff, you can't catch a break, huh?
2-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:2,one-shot-id:78=thinking.png,~Name~, didn't you lose the last round too?
2-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:2,one-shot-id:79=thinking.png,You lost again? That sucks... for you.
2-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:2,one-shot-id:80=thinking.png,Maybe you should've reviewed the rules before playing a game, ~name~.
2-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:3-=shocked.png,You're on the express train to full nudity.
2-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:3-=sad.png,How many losses in a row does this make? I feel bad for you.
2-opponent_lost,timeInStage:7-,oneShotId:94=smiling.png,Wow! I keep winning round after round. It almost seems like... magic!
2-opponent_stripping,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mask_falls,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:embarrassed,id:60=shocked.png,What's wrong? Mika, it's just a mask. You were already showing everything.
2-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip=thinking.png,So why can't you take off your own clothes, ~name~? I'm just curious.
2-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip=serious.png,You seem perfectly capable of undressing yourself, ~name~. That's just my opinion.
2-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip=thinking.png,Doesn't it take longer to have someone else remove your clothes for you?
2-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip=calm.png,I assume your partner knows everything you're wearing, huh?
2-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip=thinking.png,This is one way to have your friend participate without playing the game, I suppose.
2-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip,oneShotId:184,priority:151=thinking.png,So your friend will help you getting naked? Okaaay...
2-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip,oneShotId:184,priority:151=thinking.png,I see. So so you'll get help undressing...?
2-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Oh, at least we won't have to wait for the reveal. Whatever it is...
2-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:3=thinking.png,You're taking off your gloves, but you're still holding on to your sword. Hmmm...
2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:108,test:~clothing~:armor=sad.png,Wearing armor must be the worst. You can barely move, and it's so heavy... Plus, most of them don't even look fashionable.
2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:108,test:~clothing~:armor=sad.png,How uncomfortable is it to wear armor? Sure, it can save your life, but is it really worth it?
2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:186,test:~clothing~:belt=calm.png,Cool belt. Not as cool as mine, but it's still nice.
2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:186,test:~clothing~:belt=calm.png,Hmmm, where did you get that belt? Want me to tell you where I got mine so you can get a better looking one?
2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:102,test:~clothing~:boots=calm.png,Those are some nice boots. I used to wear mine a lot before I... joined my current crew.
2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:102,test:~clothing~:boots=calm.png,Nice boots. I still have a pair or two, even though I don't wear them that much.
2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:188,test:~clothing~:bracelets=calm.png,Do those bracelets have any significant value to you, ~name~? Mine has a lot of sentimental value. It's from my sister, Nojiko.
2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:188,test:~clothing~:bracelets=calm.png,Are those bracelets important to you, ~name~? Mine sure is. My sister, Nojiko, gave it to me.
2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:111,test:~clothing~:cape=thinking.png,I can't say I understand the point in wearing a cape. It must be so difficult to fight with that. What if it gets stuck in something?
2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:111,test:~clothing~:cape=thinking.png,Why do you even wear a cape? Does it allow you to fly or something? I think it's a little too much.
2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:106,test:~clothing~:gloves=serious.png,Now why would you wear gloves to a game of poker? Oh, because you knew you'd have to strip at one point and needed something extra to remove.
2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:106,test:~clothing~:gloves=serious.png,Gloves would be the perfect piece of clothing to hide more cards in a game of poker. You just slip them right into your hand.
2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:99,test:~clothing~:hat=smiling.png,My Captain has a hat. Do you also get super intense when someone takes it?
2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:99,test:~clothing~:hat=smiling.png,If you're taking it off, I suppose that hat isn't very important for you. Like my Captain's hat.
2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:107,test:~clothing~:necklace=greedy.png,That necklace... Is it valuable? I mean, real value. Not the sentimental kind.
2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:107,test:~clothing~:necklace=greedy.png,Pretty necklace. And... expensive looking.
2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:101,test:~clothing~:panties=serious.png,If Brook was here, he would be losing it now. Although his deal is seeing panties, not what's under them, isn't it? I really don't get it. Either way, he is a pervert.
2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:101,test:~clothing~:panties=thinking.png,Panties are all Brook ever talks about. If he was here, would he be trying to steal them, or does he just want to see them?
2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:101,test:~clothing~:panties=thinking.png,How many times have I punched Brook after he asks to see a girl's panties? I don't remember, but my knuckles hurt now.
2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:110,test:~clothing~:scarf=smiling.png,I like scarves. Too bad I only get to wear one when I go to a winter island, or I'd look out of place.
2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:110,test:~clothing~:scarf=smiling.png,Nice scarf, ~name~. I should get myself a similar one for the next time we sail to a winter island.
2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:104,test:~clothing~:shoes=smug.png,No luck, no shoes, no prize! I'm joking, even without your shoes you can still win. But you won't!
2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:104,test:~clothing~:shoes=smug.png,Be careful where you step now, ~name~. Because you're taking off your shoes, of course. I wasn't trying to threaten you, or something.
2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:112,test:~clothing~:stockings=smiling.png,Aren't stockings nice? The perfect mix of sexy and cute.
2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:112,test:~clothing~:stockings=smiling.png,Stocking are cute. Ah, so many adorable kind of clothing I could've worn for this game.
2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:100,test:~clothing~:sword=thinking.png,Only one sword? I guess that's normal. Because of Zoro, I'm now used to people carrying around three swords.
2-opponent_stripped,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:embarrassed,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:putting_mask,id:61=sad.png,Wow. I guess you never really know a person's weakness until you see it.
2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:197,count-role;target&character;human:,test:~clothing~:belt=smug.png,That's a boring belt; it doesn't even work as a holster. Relax, I'm just kidding.
2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:197,count-role;target&character;human:,test:~clothing~:belt=thinking.png,Be careful your pants don't fall down without your belt.
2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:197,count-role;target&character;human:,test:~clothing~:belt=smug.png,That belt came off very easy. Have you lost weight worrying about the game, ~player~?
2-opponent_stripped,filter:assisted_strip,oneShotId:185,priority:151=calm.png,Then you can't take off your own clothes? I've no problem with this, it just seems unnecessary.
2-opponent_stripped,filter:assisted_strip,oneShotId:185,priority:151=calm.png,This doesn't bother me, but I can't say I understand it.
2-opponent_stripped,target:human,targetStatus:lost_all,saidMarker:target1,oneShotId:12,marker:target1naked=smiling.png,Oh, now you're completely naked, ~player~. If you were to lose one more time...
2-opponent_stripped,target:human,targetStatus:lost_all,saidMarker:target1,oneShotId:12,marker:target1naked=serious.png,(One more loss, and ~player~ will be out of the game. I can do this.)
2-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:1,id:39=smiling.png,So you're a woman, huh? And you have a pretty face, that mask wasn't doing you any favors.
2-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:4=serious.png,Normally I'd be worried about something like that, but you don't seem like the kind of woman who'd use that sword unless there's a reason.
2-opponent_stripped,targetStatus:crotch_visible,totalExposed:1,oneShotId:23=shocked.png,Part of me was hoping the "getting naked" part of this game was just a bluff.
2-opponent_stripped,targetStatus:crotch_visible,totalExposed:1,oneShotId:23=sad.png,Suddenly, this game feels a lot more real.
2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:109,test:~clothing~:armor=smiling.png,Oh, not in your case, ~name~. Your armor looks great on you.
2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:109,test:~clothing~:armor=smiling.png,Oh, but I'm not talking about your armor, ~name~. This one looks so good that it's a shame to see it go.
2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:187,test:~clothing~:belt=smug.png,And my belt doubles as a holster for my Clima-Tact too. Now that's really cool.
2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:187,test:~clothing~:belt=calm.png,I can also keep my Clima-Tact in my belt. What about yours, ~name~?
2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:147,test:~clothing~:boots=thinking.png,Now I only have to wear boots when I go to a winter island, especially if it's winter there too. The rest of the time, it's not that cold.
2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:147,test:~clothing~:boots=thinking.png,We don't sail to that many cold islands, so I can wear sandals most of the time.
2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:189,test:~clothing~:bracelets=serious.png,I hope the staff here knows how to save our valuable items. Because if anything happens to my possessions I'll make them pay.
2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:189,test:~clothing~:bracelets=serious.png,Who's in charge of protecting the items we remove while we continue playing? They better be qualified.
2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:148,test:~clothing~:cape=serious.png,I suppose they look cool, but I've never cared for that. Only the guys freak out over stuff like that.
2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:148,test:~clothing~:cape=serious.png,The guys in my crew always freak out over stuff that looks cool, but is kind of pointless. Like capes.
2-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:198,test:~clothing~:glasses=smiling.png,Will you be able to see the cards without your glasses? Or that I'm cheating? Hahah, that's a joke, I'm not cheating. Not that you'll be able to tell without glasses.
2-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:198,test:~clothing~:glasses=serious.png,Are those glasses necessary for your eyes, or just for show? You didn't seem to have much of a problem with taking them off.
2-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:198,test:~clothing~:glasses=seductive.png,Without glasses I can see you have nice eyes, ~player~.
2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:149,test:~clothing~:gloves=smug.png,From now on, I'm gonna be watching your hands,  ~name~. I mean your actual hands, not your cards.
2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:149,test:~clothing~:gloves=thinking.png,If your hands get cold, you're gonna regret taking off your gloves.
2-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:199,test:~clothing~:gloves=serious.png,Who wears gloves to a poker game? Sketchy people, that's who.
2-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:199,test:~clothing~:gloves=thinking.png,Why wear gloves to this game? Do you bite your nails and you didn't want us to see?
2-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:199,test:~clothing~:gloves=smug.png,Do you bite your nails, ~player~? You have reason to be nervous, so it makes sense.
2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:150,test:~clothing~:hat=embarrassed.png,But he does let me hold on to it every now and then. I guess he trusts me.
2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:150,test:~clothing~:hat=embarrassed.png,And then when something happens to it, he comes crying to me to fix it. It's kind of adorable, I'll admit.
2-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:200,test:~clothing~:hat=calm.png,Your hair got all messy when you removed your hat. Do you want a comb, ~player~?
2-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:200,test:~clothing~:hat=greedy.png,Awww, I was kinda hoping you kept something hidden under your hat. Like your money...
2-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:200,test:~clothing~:hat=thinking.png,If Luffy was playing strip poker, would he take off his hat? Eh... I don't know why that thought entered my head.
2-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:201,test:~clothing~:headphones=furious.png,You weren't listening to music with those headphones, right? It would mean you've been ignoring everything I've been saying this whole time.
2-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:201,test:~clothing~:headphones=smiling.png,Nice headphones. What kind of music do you listen to, ~player~?
2-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:201,test:~clothing~:headphones=serious.png,You've not been using those headphones for cheating, have you? Like for getting tips from a friend, or something? Hmmm...
2-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:203,test:~clothing~:kilt=thinking.png,So you wear a skirt... Are you an okama, ~player~?
2-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:203,test:~clothing~:kilt=thinking.png,I don't think I've seen a man wearing a skirt before. Well, unless you count the okama.
2-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:203,test:~clothing~:kilt=smiling.png,You must be a confident guy to wear a skirt. I mean, you must be proud of your legs.
2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:151,test:~clothing~:necklace=smug.png,Stealing a necklace is not that hard... Eh? Who said that?
2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:151,test:~clothing~:necklace=smug.png,You better hope your necklace is not too expensive. For no reason...
2-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:204,test:~clothing~:necklace=greedy.png,That necklace looks valuable. How expensive is it, ~player~? Eh... I just would like to buy one.
2-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:204,test:~clothing~:necklace=greedy.png,Is that stone on your necklace real, ~player~? It looks big.
2-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:204,test:~clothing~:necklace=greedy.png,Is that necklace a family jewel or something, ~player~? Cause if it doesn't have sentimental value...
2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:152,test:~clothing~:scarf=thinking.png,But they really are fashionable, aren't they?
2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:152,test:~clothing~:scarf=calm.png,But still, scarves are cute.
2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:105,test:~clothing~:shoes=thinking.png,I've really gotten in the habit of wearing open-toed shoes recently. Maybe I should go shopping for new shoes soon...
2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:105,test:~clothing~:shoes=annoyed.png,Now I always wear sandals or open-toed shoes. Too bad it always attracts the feet guys. I've never understood that fixation.
2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:153,test:~clothing~:stockings=seductive.png,I doubt any men can resist a woman wearing stockings.
2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:153,test:~clothing~:stockings=seductive.png,Stockings are irresistible. I should wear them more.
2-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:202,test:~clothing~:tie=smug.png,Look at you, Big Shot. Taking off your tie. Now you're just an average player.
2-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:202,test:~clothing~:tie=thinking.png,Aren't you thinking you'll look less professional without your tie.
2-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:202,test:~clothing~:tie=calm.png,Oh, I liked the tie. It really made you look like you knew what you were doing.

2-opponent_chest_will_be_visible,target:chihiro,id:41=shocked.png,Hey, where are you going? Huh?
2-opponent_chest_will_be_visible,target:lucina=serious.png,Come on, this isn't a big deal. I'm sure you've faced more dire situations than this one.
2-opponent_chest_is_visible,target:chihiro=serious.png,Hey, you can't replace yourself with... whatever that device is. It clearly isn't a Den Den Mushi. Either way, that's against the rules.
2-opponent_chest_is_visible,target:lucina=smiling.png,Well, if you're a warrior, bigger breasts probably wouldn't help you at all.
2-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:confident,oneShotId:113=serious.png,This is the moment your confidence is really put to the test, ~name~.
2-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:confident,oneShotId:113=serious.png,You seem pretty confident, ~name~. But still...
2-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:180=serious.png,Do you actually want to be naked? I don't get it.
2-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:180=serious.png,Why do you want to show your body so much? And why do you assume we want to see it?
2-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:shy,oneShotId:164=sad.png,Don't be so scared, ~name~. I wish I could do something for you, but...
2-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:shy,oneShotId:164=sad.png,I feel so bad for ~name~. This is not something one should be forced to do unless you want to.
2-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:shy,oneShotId:164=calm.png,You're confronting your fear, ~name~. I believe in you.
2-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chihiro=sad.png,I understand you're scared, but don't run away again, okay?
2-opponent_crotch_is_visible,target:chihiro,id:1=shocked.png,You're a guy? But you look so girly... I'm sorry, this just really caught me by surprise.
2-opponent_crotch_is_visible,target:chihiro,id:1=shocked.png,Oh, I didn't see this coming. You really look like a girl...
2-opponent_start_masturbating,target:human,saidMarker:target1end,oneShotId:16=calm.png,~Player~, I, eh... wasn't serious about what I said. I was using you to win the game. I'm really sorry, I promise I'll make it up to you after I win the game.
2-opponent_start_masturbating,target:human,saidMarker:target1end,oneShotId:16=calm.png,I have a confession. I was seducing you so I would have a better chance of winning the game. I'm really sorry, ~player~. But your sacrifice won't be in vain if I win. I promise you I won't forget.
2-opponent_start_masturbating,target:human,saidMarker:target2end,oneShotId:70=calm.png,I'll make it up to you, ~player~. Not with money, of course. Maybe I can get Sanji to cook you something, or...
2-opponent_start_masturbating,target:human,saidMarker:target2end,oneShotId:70=calm.png,Maybe I can do something for you, ~player~. Something other than giving you the prize, of course.  I could get Usopp to make something for you? Nah, that's too lame.
2-opponent_start_masturbating,target:lucina=shocked.png,Are you praying? You know the punishment for losing the game is a little different, right?
2-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:lucina,targetTimeInStage:0-,targetSaidMarker:finished,targetSayingMarker:sit_on_crate=shocked.png,Did you just yell out Robin? Oh, I guess that's a different Robin. Sorry, I have a friend named Robin too, so I got confused for second.

3-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:bounty_hunter,oneShotId:178=serious.png,Now that you know I'm a pirate, I hope you won't get any ideas, ~name~. Even if you managed to capture me, my crew won't stand idly by, and they'll come after you with all they have. That's just a friendly warning.

3-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:exotic_hair,oneShotId:167=thinking.png,That's a very unique hairstyle you have. It would be quite easy to identify you with that.
3-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:fancy,oneShotId:172=greedy.png,You're rich, aren't you? You don't have to tell me. Are you looking for some new friends, ~name~?

3-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:hero,oneShotId:166,priority:225=smiling.png,I can tell you're a good person, ~name~. I hope we can get along.

3-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:pirate,oneShotId:176=smiling.png,So we're both pirates. But there's no reason why we couldn't get along, huh? You don't seem that bad.
3-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:pirate,oneShotId:176=smiling.png,Pirates playing poker. Normally this wouldn't end well for any of us, but you don't seem too bad to me, ~name~.
3-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:shy,oneShotId:237=greedy.png,Why did you come to play this game if you're so scared of losing? Oh, it must be because of the prize. I get you.
3-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:shy,oneShotId:237=sad.png,Aren't you a little too shy to play a game like this one? You should start with something easier, like regular poker.

3-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:very_long_hair,oneShotId:174,priority:220=thinking.png,I could never have hair that long. I'd probably trip on it everytime I walk.

3-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:manipulation4,notSaidMarker:manipulation4end,oneShotId:50,marker:manipulation4end=smiling.png,Oh, that worked! I mean, well done, ~player~. You're safe for now.

3-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:seduction_final,oneShotId:15,marker:target1end=sad.png,Thank you, ~player~! You're the best, and you... lost. Uh...
3-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:seduction4,notSaidMarker:seduction4end,oneShotId:34,marker:seduction4end=happy.png,Yes, I didn't lose! So, who loses this round?
3-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:seduction4,notSaidMarker:seduction4end,oneShotId:34,marker:seduction4end=greedy.png,Oh, yeah! That prize is going to be mine! Who has to strip, then? ~player~? Cool.
3-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:seduction4,notSaidMarker:seduction4end,oneShotId:34,marker:seduction4end=smiling.png,Heheh, what about that? I'm safe. Hmmm, looks like it's your turn to strip, ~player~. Chop, chop.
3-opponent_lost,target:lucina,targetStage:0=calm.png,Why the mask? Are you hiding something? I guess we all have something to hide.
3-opponent_lost,target:lucina,targetStage:4=thinking.png,Now that I look at you closer, Lucina... Are your eyes different from each other? They're not exactly the same color...
3-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:2,one-shot-id:77=thinking.png,Uff, you can't catch a break, huh?
3-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:2,one-shot-id:78=thinking.png,~Name~, didn't you lose the last round too?
3-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:2,one-shot-id:79=thinking.png,You lost again? That sucks... for you.
3-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:2,one-shot-id:80=thinking.png,Maybe you should've reviewed the rules before playing a game, ~name~.
3-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:3-=shocked.png,You're on the express train to full nudity.
3-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:3-=sad.png,How many losses in a row does this make? I feel bad for you.
3-opponent_lost,timeInStage:7-,oneShotId:94=smiling.png,Wow! I keep winning round after round. It almost seems like... magic!
3-opponent_stripping,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mask_falls,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:embarrassed,id:60=shocked.png,What's wrong? Mika, it's just a mask. You were already showing everything.
3-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip=thinking.png,So why can't you take off your own clothes, ~name~? I'm just curious.
3-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip=serious.png,You seem perfectly capable of undressing yourself, ~name~. That's just my opinion.
3-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip=thinking.png,Doesn't it take longer to have someone else remove your clothes for you?
3-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip=calm.png,I assume your partner knows everything you're wearing, huh?
3-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip=thinking.png,This is one way to have your friend participate without playing the game, I suppose.
3-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip,oneShotId:184,priority:151=thinking.png,So your friend will help you getting naked? Okaaay...
3-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip,oneShotId:184,priority:151=thinking.png,I see. So so you'll get help undressing...?
3-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Oh, at least we won't have to wait for the reveal. Whatever it is...
3-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:3=thinking.png,You're taking off your gloves, but you're still holding on to your sword. Hmmm...
3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:108,test:~clothing~:armor=sad.png,Wearing armor must be the worst. You can barely move, and it's so heavy... Plus, most of them don't even look fashionable.
3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:108,test:~clothing~:armor=sad.png,How uncomfortable is it to wear armor? Sure, it can save your life, but is it really worth it?
3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:186,test:~clothing~:belt=calm.png,Cool belt. Not as cool as mine, but it's still nice.
3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:186,test:~clothing~:belt=calm.png,Hmmm, where did you get that belt? Want me to tell you where I got mine so you can get a better looking one?
3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:103,test:~clothing~:boots=calm.png,Those are some nice boots. I used to wear mine a lot in my pre pirate days.
3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:103,test:~clothing~:boots=calm.png,Nice boots. I still have a pair or two, even though I don't wear them that much.
3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:188,test:~clothing~:bracelets=calm.png,Do those bracelets have any significant value to you, ~name~? Mine has a lot of sentimental value. It's from my sister, Nojiko.
3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:188,test:~clothing~:bracelets=calm.png,Are those bracelets important to you, ~name~? Mine sure is. My sister, Nojiko, gave it to me.
3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:111,test:~clothing~:cape=thinking.png,I can't say I understand the point in wearing a cape. It must be so difficult to fight with that. What if it gets stuck in something?
3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:111,test:~clothing~:cape=thinking.png,Why do you even wear a cape? Does it allow you to fly or something? I think it's a little too much.
3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:106,test:~clothing~:gloves=serious.png,Now why would you wear gloves to a game of poker? Oh, because you knew you'd have to strip at one point and needed something extra to remove.
3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:106,test:~clothing~:gloves=serious.png,Gloves would be the perfect piece of clothing to hide more cards in a game of poker. You just slip them right into your hand.
3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:99,test:~clothing~:hat=smiling.png,My Captain has a hat. Do you also get super intense when someone takes it?
3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:99,test:~clothing~:hat=smiling.png,If you're taking it off, I suppose that hat isn't very important for you. Like my Captain's hat.
3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:107,test:~clothing~:necklace=greedy.png,That necklace... Is it valuable? I mean, real value. Not the sentimental kind.
3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:107,test:~clothing~:necklace=greedy.png,Pretty necklace. And... expensive looking.
3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:101,test:~clothing~:panties=serious.png,If Brook was here, he would be losing it now. Although his deal is seeing panties, not what's under them, isn't it? I really don't get it. Either way, he is a pervert.
3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:101,test:~clothing~:panties=thinking.png,Panties are all Brook ever talks about. If he was here, would he be trying to steal them, or does he just want to see them?
3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:101,test:~clothing~:panties=thinking.png,How many times have I punched Brook after he asks to see a girl's panties? I don't remember, but my knuckles hurt now.
3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:110,test:~clothing~:scarf=smiling.png,I like scarves. Too bad I only get to wear one when I go to a winter island, or I'd look out of place.
3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:110,test:~clothing~:scarf=smiling.png,Nice scarf, ~name~. I should get myself a similar one for the next time we sail to a winter island.
3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:104,test:~clothing~:shoes=smug.png,No luck, no shoes, no prize! I'm joking, even without your shoes you can still win. But you won't!
3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:104,test:~clothing~:shoes=smug.png,Be careful where you step now, ~name~. Because you're taking off your shoes, of course. I wasn't trying to threaten you, or something.
3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:112,test:~clothing~:stockings=smiling.png,Aren't stockings nice? The perfect mix of sexy and cute.
3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:112,test:~clothing~:stockings=smiling.png,Stocking are cute. Ah, so many adorable kind of clothing I could've worn for this game.
3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:100,test:~clothing~:sword=thinking.png,Only one sword? I guess that's normal. Because of Zoro, I'm now used to people carrying around three swords.
3-opponent_stripped,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:embarrassed,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:putting_mask,id:61=sad.png,Wow. I guess you never really know a person's weakness until you see it.
3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:197,count-role;target&character;human:,test:~clothing~:belt=smug.png,That's a boring belt; it doesn't even work as a holster. Relax, I'm just kidding.
3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:197,count-role;target&character;human:,test:~clothing~:belt=thinking.png,Be careful your pants don't fall down without your belt.
3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:197,count-role;target&character;human:,test:~clothing~:belt=smug.png,That belt came off very easy. Have you lost weight worrying about the game, ~player~?
3-opponent_stripped,filter:assisted_strip,oneShotId:185,priority:151=calm.png,Then you can't take off your own clothes? I've no problem with this, it just seems unnecessary.
3-opponent_stripped,filter:assisted_strip,oneShotId:185,priority:151=calm.png,This doesn't bother me, but I can't say I understand it.
3-opponent_stripped,target:human,targetStatus:lost_all,saidMarker:target1,oneShotId:12,marker:target1naked=smiling.png,Oh, now you're completely naked, ~player~. If you were to lose one more time...
3-opponent_stripped,target:human,targetStatus:lost_all,saidMarker:target1,oneShotId:12,marker:target1naked=serious.png,(One more loss, and ~player~ will be out of the game. I can do this.)
3-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:1,id:39=smiling.png,So you're a woman, huh? And you have a pretty face, that mask wasn't doing you any favors.
3-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:4=serious.png,Normally I'd be worried about something like that, but you don't seem like the kind of woman who'd use that sword unless there's a reason.
3-opponent_stripped,targetStatus:crotch_visible,totalExposed:1,oneShotId:23=shocked.png,Part of me was hoping the "getting naked" part of this game was just a bluff.
3-opponent_stripped,targetStatus:crotch_visible,totalExposed:1,oneShotId:23=sad.png,Suddenly, this game feels a lot more real.
3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:109,test:~clothing~:armor=smiling.png,Oh, not in your case, ~name~. Your armor looks great on you.
3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:109,test:~clothing~:armor=smiling.png,Oh, but I'm not talking about your armor, ~name~. This one looks so good that it's a shame to see it go.
3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:187,test:~clothing~:belt=smug.png,And my belt doubles as a holster for my Clima-Tact too. Now that's really cool.
3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:187,test:~clothing~:belt=calm.png,I can also keep my Clima-Tact in my belt. What about yours, ~name~?
3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:147,test:~clothing~:boots=thinking.png,Now I only have to wear boots when I go to a winter island, especially if it's winter there too. The rest of the time, it's not that cold.
3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:147,test:~clothing~:boots=thinking.png,We don't sail to that many cold islands, so I can wear sandals most of the time.
3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:189,test:~clothing~:bracelets=serious.png,I hope the staff here knows how to save our valuable items. Because if anything happens to my possessions I'll make them pay.
3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:189,test:~clothing~:bracelets=serious.png,Who's in charge of protecting the items we remove while we continue playing? They better be qualified.
3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:148,test:~clothing~:cape=serious.png,I suppose they look cool, but I've never cared for that. Only the guys freak out over stuff like that.
3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:148,test:~clothing~:cape=serious.png,The guys in my crew always freak out over stuff that looks cool, but is kind of pointless. Like capes.
3-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:198,test:~clothing~:glasses=smiling.png,Will you be able to see the cards without your glasses? Or that I'm cheating? Hahah, that's a joke, I'm not cheating. Not that you'll be able to tell without glasses.
3-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:198,test:~clothing~:glasses=serious.png,Are those glasses necessary for your eyes, or just for show? You didn't seem to have much of a problem with taking them off.
3-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:198,test:~clothing~:glasses=seductive.png,Without glasses I can see you have nice eyes, ~player~.
3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:149,test:~clothing~:gloves=smug.png,From now on, I'm gonna be watching your hands,  ~name~. I mean your actual hands, not your cards.
3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:149,test:~clothing~:gloves=thinking.png,If your hands get cold, you're gonna regret taking off your gloves.
3-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:199,test:~clothing~:gloves=serious.png,Who wears gloves to a poker game? Sketchy people, that's who.
3-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:199,test:~clothing~:gloves=thinking.png,Why wear gloves to this game? Do you bite your nails and you didn't want us to see?
3-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:199,test:~clothing~:gloves=smug.png,Do you bite your nails, ~player~? You have reason to be nervous, so it makes sense.
3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:150,test:~clothing~:hat=embarrassed.png,But he does let me hold on to it every now and then. I guess he trusts me.
3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:150,test:~clothing~:hat=embarrassed.png,And then when something happens to it, he comes crying to me to fix it. It's kind of adorable, I'll admit.
3-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:200,test:~clothing~:hat=calm.png,Your hair got all messy when you removed your hat. Do you want a comb, ~player~?
3-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:200,test:~clothing~:hat=greedy.png,Awww, I was kinda hoping you kept something hidden under your hat. Like your money...
3-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:200,test:~clothing~:hat=thinking.png,If Luffy was playing strip poker, would he take off his hat? Eh... I don't know why that thought entered my head.
3-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:201,test:~clothing~:headphones=furious.png,You weren't listening to music with those headphones, right? It would mean you've been ignoring everything I've been saying this whole time.
3-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:201,test:~clothing~:headphones=smiling.png,Nice headphones. What kind of music do you listen to, ~player~?
3-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:201,test:~clothing~:headphones=serious.png,You've not been using those headphones for cheating, have you? Like for getting tips from a friend, or something? Hmmm...
3-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:203,test:~clothing~:kilt=thinking.png,So you wear a skirt... Are you an okama, ~player~?
3-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:203,test:~clothing~:kilt=thinking.png,I don't think I've seen a man wearing a skirt before. Well, unless you count the okama.
3-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:203,test:~clothing~:kilt=smiling.png,You must be a confident guy to wear a skirt. I mean, you must be proud of your legs.
3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:151,test:~clothing~:necklace=smug.png,Stealing a necklace is not that hard... Eh? Who said that?
3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:151,test:~clothing~:necklace=smug.png,You better hope your necklace is not too expensive. For no reason...
3-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:204,test:~clothing~:necklace=greedy.png,That necklace looks valuable. How expensive is it, ~player~? Eh... I just would like to buy one.
3-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:204,test:~clothing~:necklace=greedy.png,Is that stone on your necklace real, ~player~? It looks big.
3-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:204,test:~clothing~:necklace=greedy.png,Is that necklace a family jewel or something, ~player~? Cause if it doesn't have sentimental value...
3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:152,test:~clothing~:scarf=thinking.png,But they really are fashionable, aren't they?
3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:152,test:~clothing~:scarf=calm.png,But still, scarves are cute.
3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:105,test:~clothing~:shoes=thinking.png,I've really gotten in the habit of wearing open-toed shoes recently. Maybe I should go shopping for new shoes soon...
3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:105,test:~clothing~:shoes=annoyed.png,Now I always wear sandals or open-toed shoes. Too bad it always attracts the feet guys. I've never understood that fixation.
3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:153,test:~clothing~:stockings=seductive.png,I doubt any men can resist a woman wearing stockings.
3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:153,test:~clothing~:stockings=seductive.png,Stockings are irresistible. I should wear them more.
3-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:202,test:~clothing~:tie=smug.png,Look at you, Big Shot. Taking off your tie. Now you're just an average player.
3-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:202,test:~clothing~:tie=thinking.png,Aren't you thinking you'll look less professional without your tie.
3-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:202,test:~clothing~:tie=calm.png,Oh, I liked the tie. It really made you look like you knew what you were doing.
3-opponent_stripped,target:human,targetStatus:lost_all,saidMarker:target2,oneShotId:65,test:~target.gender~:female,marker:target2naked=thinking.png,(Hmmm, so ~player~ is now fully naked. Which means she only has to lose once more to be out. How am I going to do this?)
3-opponent_stripped,target:human,targetStatus:lost_all,saidMarker:target2,oneShotId:65,test:~target.gender~:female,marker:target2naked=thinking.png,(One more loss for ~player~, and she'll be out. Maybe I can "help" her with that. I don't want to do this to a woman, but this is about survival.)
3-opponent_stripped,target:human,targetStatus:lost_all,saidMarker:target2,oneShotId:63,test:~target.gender~:male,marker:target2naked=thinking.png,(Hmmm, so ~player~ is now fully naked. Which means he only has to lose once more to be out. How am I going to do this?)

3-opponent_chest_will_be_visible,target:chihiro,id:41=shocked.png,Hey, where are you going? Huh?
3-opponent_chest_will_be_visible,target:lucina=serious.png,Come on, this isn't a big deal. I'm sure you've faced more dire situations than this one.
3-opponent_chest_is_visible,target:chihiro=serious.png,Hey, you can't replace yourself with... whatever that device is. It clearly isn't a Den Den Mushi. Either way, that's against the rules.
3-opponent_chest_is_visible,target:lucina=smiling.png,Well, if you're a warrior, bigger breasts probably wouldn't help you at all.
3-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:confident,oneShotId:113=serious.png,This is the moment your confidence is really put to the test, ~name~.
3-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:confident,oneShotId:113=serious.png,You seem pretty confident, ~name~. But still...
3-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:180=serious.png,Do you actually want to be naked? I don't get it.
3-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:180=serious.png,Why do you want to show your body so much? And why do you assume we want to see it?
3-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:shy,oneShotId:164=sad.png,Don't be so scared, ~name~. I wish I could do something for you, but...
3-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:shy,oneShotId:164=sad.png,I feel so bad for ~name~. This is not something one should be forced to do unless you want to.
3-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:shy,oneShotId:164=calm.png,You're confronting your fear, ~name~. I believe in you.
3-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chihiro=sad.png,I understand you're scared, but don't run away again, okay?
3-opponent_crotch_is_visible,target:chihiro,id:1=shocked.png,You're a guy? But you look so girly... I'm sorry, this just really caught me by surprise.
3-opponent_crotch_is_visible,target:chihiro,id:1=shocked.png,Oh, I didn't see this coming. You really look like a girl...
3-opponent_start_masturbating,target:human,saidMarker:target1end,oneShotId:16=calm.png,~Player~, I, eh... wasn't serious about what I said. I was using you to win the game. I'm really sorry, I promise I'll make it up to you after I win the game.
3-opponent_start_masturbating,target:human,saidMarker:target1end,oneShotId:16=calm.png,I have a confession. I was seducing you so I would have a better chance of winning the game. I'm really sorry, ~player~. But your sacrifice won't be in vain if I win. I promise you I won't forget.
3-opponent_start_masturbating,target:human,saidMarker:target2end,oneShotId:70=calm.png,I'll make it up to you, ~player~. Not with money, of course. Maybe I can get Sanji to cook you something, or...
3-opponent_start_masturbating,target:human,saidMarker:target2end,oneShotId:70=calm.png,Maybe I can do something for you, ~player~. Something other than giving you the prize, of course.  I could get Usopp to make something for you? Nah, that's too lame.
3-opponent_start_masturbating,target:lucina=shocked.png,Are you praying? You know the punishment for losing the game is a little different, right?
3-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:lucina,targetTimeInStage:0-,targetSaidMarker:finished,targetSayingMarker:sit_on_crate=shocked.png,Did you just yell out Robin? Oh, I guess that's a different Robin. Sorry, I have a friend named Robin too, so I got confused for second.

4-opponent_lost,alsoPlaying:human,saidMarker:manipulation_final,oneShotId:69,priority:301,marker:target2end=sad.png,Oh, so you didn't lose, ~player~? Did you hear what I said? I'm just worried for your health. Well, if you do get sick, maybe my doctor friend can help you. His name is Chopper.
4-opponent_lost,alsoPlaying:human,saidMarker:manipulation5,notSaidMarker:manipulation5end,oneShotId:55,priority:302,marker:manipulation5end=happy.png,Hey, ~name~ lost instead of ~player~! That means I don't owe you anything, heheh.
4-opponent_lost,alsoPlaying:human,saidMarker:manipulation5,notSaidMarker:manipulation5end,oneShotId:55,priority:302,marker:manipulation5end=greedy.png,Oh, ~name~, lost! So consider my offer withdrawn, ~player~. That means the prize is still all mine, heheh...
4-opponent_lost,alsoPlaying:human,saidMarker:manipulation5,notSaidMarker:manipulation5end,oneShotId:55,priority:302,marker:manipulation5end=happy.png,Haha, ~name~ lost! So I don't have to give you that 10%, ~player~! What a relief.
4-opponent_lost,alsoPlaying:human,saidMarker:seduction_final,oneShotId:22,priority:301=calm.png,Oh, it was ~name~ who lost instead. But if you want to lose the next round, ~player~...
4-opponent_lost,alsoPlaying:human,saidMarker:seduction_final,oneShotId:22,priority:301=sad.png,I see ~name~ lost this round. ~player~, do you still want to lose the next round for me?
4-opponent_lost,alsoPlaying:human,saidMarker:seduction5,notSaidMarker:seduction5end,oneShotId:20,priority:302,marker:seduction5end=smiling.png,Oh, I see ~name~ lost this round. Was I saying something before? Heheh...

4-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:bounty_hunter,oneShotId:178=smiling.png,Now you know there's a bounty on me, but aren't you here to relax, ~name~? If you want to capture me, you can do it after the game. (When I'll be long gone.)
4-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:bounty_hunter,oneShotId:178=serious.png,Now that you know I'm a pirate, I hope you won't get any ideas, ~name~. Even if you managed to capture me, my crew won't stand idly by, and they'll come after you with all they have. That's just a friendly warning.
4-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:cheerful,oneShotId:168,priority:225,one-shot-id:4=smiling.png,You're the life of this table, aren't you, ~name~?
4-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:cheerful,oneShotId:168,priority:225,one-shot-id:76=smiling.png,My, you're a cheerful one, aren't you? Nothing wrong with that.
4-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:exotic_hair,oneShotId:167=calm.png,I've met people with weird hairstyles, but wow...
4-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:exotic_hair,oneShotId:167=thinking.png,That's a very unique hairstyle you have. It would be quite easy to identify you with that.
4-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:fancy,oneShotId:172=greedy.png,You're rich, aren't you? You don't have to tell me. Are you looking for some new friends, ~name~?
4-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:fancy,oneShotId:172,one-shot-id:6=greedy.png,Those clothes... You must be rich, huh? I hope we can be friends, ~name~. For no reason in particular, heheh.
4-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:hero,oneShotId:166,priority:225=smiling.png,I can tell you're a good person, ~name~. I hope we can get along.
4-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:hero,oneShotId:166,priority:225,one-shot-id:2=calm.png,It seems to me your heart is in the right place. If I don't win this game, I hope you do. But I'm really gonna win!
4-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:musician,oneShotId:175,priority:240=smiling.png,You play music, ~name~? I wonder if you have anything to teach Brook. I doubt it, he's really good. Though I probably wouldn't say it to his face.
4-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:musician,oneShotId:175,priority:240=smiling.png,You're a musician, huh? My crew mate, Brook, plays... pretty much every instrument. And don't tell him I said this, but he's really good.
4-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:pirate,oneShotId:176=smiling.png,So we're both pirates. But there's no reason why we couldn't get along, huh? You don't seem that bad.
4-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:pirate,oneShotId:176=smiling.png,Pirates playing poker. Normally this wouldn't end well for any of us, but you don't seem too bad to me, ~name~.
4-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:shy,oneShotId:237=greedy.png,Why did you come to play this game if you're so scared of losing? Oh, it must be because of the prize. I get you.
4-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:shy,oneShotId:237=sad.png,Aren't you a little too shy to play a game like this one? You should start with something easier, like regular poker.
4-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:very_long_hair,oneShotId:174,priority:220=thinking.png,How do you even take care of hair that long? Doesn't it get tangled everywhere?
4-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:very_long_hair,oneShotId:174,priority:220=thinking.png,I could never have hair that long. I'd probably trip on it everytime I walk.

4-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:weapon,oneShotId:169,priority:225=calm.png,I hope you have no intention of using that weapon, or there will be trouble. And I'll be out of here.
4-opponent_lost,hasHand:High Card,oneShotId:192=smiling.png,Oh, what a relief. I worried for nothing.
4-opponent_lost,hasHand:High Card,oneShotId:192=happy.png,Woohoo! I made it through.
4-opponent_lost,hasHand:High Card,oneShotId:192=smiling.png,Fine, I'll strip... Oh, wait, I didn't lose. ~Name~ lost, hahah...
4-opponent_lost,target:chihiro,targetStage:0=sad.png,You look way too young and innocent. I'm not looking forward to seeing you lose, little girl.

4-opponent_lost,target:chihiro,targetStage:5=serious.png,Ah, you finally came back. You owe us all an apology.
4-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:manipulation_final,oneShotId:68,marker:target2end=calm.png,Oh, you... lost? That's good, I was worried for your health, and... I'm sorry, that wasn't very nice of me.
4-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:manipulation_final,oneShotId:68,marker:target2end=sad.png,You actually lost? Is it because of what I said? M-maybe you won't really get sick, and... I'm sorry, I guess this is my fault.
4-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:manipulation5,notSaidMarker:manipulation5end,oneShotId:54,marker:manipulation5end=calm.png,Alright! Smart move, ~player~. You've earned your 5% of the prize. Now I just have to win it.
4-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:manipulation5,notSaidMarker:manipulation5end,oneShotId:54,marker:manipulation5end=calm.png,Good, ~player~. You don't want it in writing that I'm giving you 5% of the prize, right? I mean, you can trust me!
4-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:manipulation5,notSaidMarker:manipulation5end,oneShotId:54,marker:manipulation5end=calm.png,Excellent choice, ~player~! Now how do you want your 5% of the prize? I can give it to you in cash, but maybe...
4-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:seduction_final,oneShotId:15,marker:target1end=sad.png,Yes! Thank you, ~player~! Oh. Eh...
4-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:seduction_final,oneShotId:15,marker:target1end=sad.png,~Player~ lost! Yeah! Hmm...

4-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:seduction5,notSaidMarker:seduction5end,oneShotId:9,marker:seduction5end=happy.png,Yay! Oh, yeah... I'll lose the next round, ~player~. I just hope I don't accidentally get a <i>really</i> good hand.
4-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:seduction5,notSaidMarker:seduction5end,oneShotId:9,marker:seduction5end=smiling.png,Heheh, nice, ~player~! Oh, I agreed to lose the next round, didn't I? How about I lose the round after the next one instead? I'm just a little tired.
4-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:seduction5,notSaidMarker:seduction5end,oneShotId:9,marker:seduction5end=smiling.png,Thank you, ~player~! You're very nice. Lose the next round? Oh, I did say that, didn't I? Well, let's see what cards I get first.
4-opponent_lost,target:lucina,targetStage:0=calm.png,Why the mask? Are you hiding something? I guess we all have something to hide.
4-opponent_lost,target:lucina,targetStage:4=thinking.png,Now that I look at you closer, Lucina... Are your eyes different from each other? They're not exactly the same color...
4-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:2,one-shot-id:77=thinking.png,Uff, you can't catch a break, huh?
4-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:2,one-shot-id:78=thinking.png,~Name~, didn't you lose the last round too?
4-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:2,one-shot-id:79=thinking.png,You lost again? That sucks... for you.
4-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:2,one-shot-id:80=thinking.png,Maybe you should've reviewed the rules before playing a game, ~name~.
4-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:3-=shocked.png,You're on the express train to full nudity.
4-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:3-=sad.png,How many losses in a row does this make? I feel bad for you.
4-opponent_lost,timeInStage:7-,oneShotId:94=smiling.png,Wow! I keep winning round after round. It almost seems like... magic!
4-opponent_stripping,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mask_falls,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:embarrassed,id:60=shocked.png,What's wrong? Mika, it's just a mask. You were already showing everything.
4-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip=thinking.png,So why can't you take off your own clothes, ~name~? I'm just curious.
4-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip=serious.png,You seem perfectly capable of undressing yourself, ~name~. That's just my opinion.
4-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip=thinking.png,Doesn't it take longer to have someone else remove your clothes for you?
4-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip=calm.png,I assume your partner knows everything you're wearing, huh?
4-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip=thinking.png,This is one way to have your friend participate without playing the game, I suppose.
4-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip,oneShotId:184,priority:151=thinking.png,So your friend will help you getting naked? Okaaay...
4-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip,oneShotId:184,priority:151=thinking.png,I see. So so you'll get help undressing...?
4-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Oh, at least we won't have to wait for the reveal. Whatever it is...
4-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:3=thinking.png,You're taking off your gloves, but you're still holding on to your sword. Hmmm...
4-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:108,test:~clothing~:armor=sad.png,Wearing armor must be the worst. You can barely move, and it's so heavy... Plus, most of them don't even look fashionable.
4-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:108,test:~clothing~:armor=sad.png,How uncomfortable is it to wear armor? Sure, it can save your life, but is it really worth it?
4-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:186,test:~clothing~:belt=calm.png,Cool belt. Not as cool as mine, but it's still nice.
4-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:186,test:~clothing~:belt=calm.png,Hmmm, where did you get that belt? Want me to tell you where I got mine so you can get a better looking one?
4-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:103,test:~clothing~:boots=calm.png,Those are some nice boots. I used to wear mine a lot in my pre pirate days.
4-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:103,test:~clothing~:boots=calm.png,Nice boots. I still have a pair or two, even though I don't wear them that much.
4-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:188,test:~clothing~:bracelets=calm.png,Do those bracelets have any significant value to you, ~name~? Mine has a lot of sentimental value. It's from my sister, Nojiko.
4-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:188,test:~clothing~:bracelets=calm.png,Are those bracelets important to you, ~name~? Mine sure is. My sister, Nojiko, gave it to me.
4-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:111,test:~clothing~:cape=thinking.png,I can't say I understand the point in wearing a cape. It must be so difficult to fight with that. What if it gets stuck in something?
4-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:111,test:~clothing~:cape=thinking.png,Why do you even wear a cape? Does it allow you to fly or something? I think it's a little too much.
4-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:106,test:~clothing~:gloves=serious.png,Now why would you wear gloves to a game of poker? Oh, because you knew you'd have to strip at one point and needed something extra to remove.
4-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:106,test:~clothing~:gloves=serious.png,Gloves would be the perfect piece of clothing to hide more cards in a game of poker. You just slip them right into your hand.
4-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:99,test:~clothing~:hat=smiling.png,My Captain has a hat. Do you also get super intense when someone takes it?
4-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:99,test:~clothing~:hat=smiling.png,If you're taking it off, I suppose that hat isn't very important for you. Like my Captain's hat.
4-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:107,test:~clothing~:necklace=greedy.png,That necklace... Is it valuable? I mean, real value. Not the sentimental kind.
4-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:107,test:~clothing~:necklace=greedy.png,Pretty necklace. And... expensive looking.
4-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:101,test:~clothing~:panties=serious.png,If Brook was here, he would be losing it now. Although his deal is seeing panties, not what's under them, isn't it? I really don't get it. Either way, he is a pervert.
4-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:101,test:~clothing~:panties=thinking.png,Panties are all Brook ever talks about. If he was here, would he be trying to steal them, or does he just want to see them?
4-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:101,test:~clothing~:panties=thinking.png,How many times have I punched Brook after he asks to see a girl's panties? I don't remember, but my knuckles hurt now.
4-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:110,test:~clothing~:scarf=smiling.png,I like scarves. Too bad I only get to wear one when I go to a winter island, or I'd look out of place.
4-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:110,test:~clothing~:scarf=smiling.png,Nice scarf, ~name~. I should get myself a similar one for the next time we sail to a winter island.
4-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:104,test:~clothing~:shoes=smug.png,No luck, no shoes, no prize! I'm joking, even without your shoes you can still win. But you won't!
4-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:104,test:~clothing~:shoes=smug.png,Be careful where you step now, ~name~. Because you're taking off your shoes, of course. I wasn't trying to threaten you, or something.
4-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:112,test:~clothing~:stockings=smiling.png,Aren't stockings nice? The perfect mix of sexy and cute.
4-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:112,test:~clothing~:stockings=smiling.png,Stocking are cute. Ah, so many adorable kind of clothing I could've worn for this game.
4-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:100,test:~clothing~:sword=thinking.png,Only one sword? I guess that's normal. Because of Zoro, I'm now used to people carrying around three swords.
4-opponent_stripped,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:embarrassed,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:putting_mask,id:61=sad.png,Wow. I guess you never really know a person's weakness until you see it.
4-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:197,count-role;target&character;human:,test:~clothing~:belt=smug.png,That's a boring belt; it doesn't even work as a holster. Relax, I'm just kidding.
4-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:197,count-role;target&character;human:,test:~clothing~:belt=thinking.png,Be careful your pants don't fall down without your belt.
4-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:197,count-role;target&character;human:,test:~clothing~:belt=smug.png,That belt came off very easy. Have you lost weight worrying about the game, ~player~?
4-opponent_stripped,filter:assisted_strip,oneShotId:185,priority:151=calm.png,Then you can't take off your own clothes? I've no problem with this, it just seems unnecessary.
4-opponent_stripped,filter:assisted_strip,oneShotId:185,priority:151=calm.png,This doesn't bother me, but I can't say I understand it.
4-opponent_stripped,target:human,targetStatus:lost_all,saidMarker:target1,oneShotId:12,marker:target1naked=smiling.png,Oh, now you're completely naked, ~player~. If you were to lose one more time...
4-opponent_stripped,target:human,targetStatus:lost_all,saidMarker:target1,oneShotId:12,marker:target1naked=serious.png,(One more loss, and ~player~ will be out of the game. I can do this.)
4-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:1,id:39=smiling.png,So you're a woman, huh? And you have a pretty face, that mask wasn't doing you any favors.
4-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:4=serious.png,Normally I'd be worried about something like that, but you don't seem like the kind of woman who'd use that sword unless there's a reason.
4-opponent_stripped,targetStatus:crotch_visible,totalExposed:1,oneShotId:23=shocked.png,Part of me was hoping the "getting naked" part of this game was just a bluff.
4-opponent_stripped,targetStatus:crotch_visible,totalExposed:1,oneShotId:23=sad.png,Suddenly, this game feels a lot more real.
4-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:109,test:~clothing~:armor=smiling.png,Oh, not in your case, ~name~. Your armor looks great on you.
4-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:109,test:~clothing~:armor=smiling.png,Oh, but I'm not talking about your armor, ~name~. This one looks so good that it's a shame to see it go.
4-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:187,test:~clothing~:belt=smug.png,And my belt doubles as a holster for my Clima-Tact too. Now that's really cool.
4-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:187,test:~clothing~:belt=calm.png,I can also keep my Clima-Tact in my belt. What about yours, ~name~?
4-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:147,test:~clothing~:boots=thinking.png,Now I only have to wear boots when I go to a winter island, especially if it's winter there too. The rest of the time, it's not that cold.
4-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:147,test:~clothing~:boots=thinking.png,We don't sail to that many cold islands, so I can wear sandals most of the time.
4-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:189,test:~clothing~:bracelets=serious.png,I hope the staff here knows how to save our valuable items. Because if anything happens to my possessions I'll make them pay.
4-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:189,test:~clothing~:bracelets=serious.png,Who's in charge of protecting the items we remove while we continue playing? They better be qualified.
4-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:148,test:~clothing~:cape=serious.png,I suppose they look cool, but I've never cared for that. Only the guys freak out over stuff like that.
4-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:148,test:~clothing~:cape=serious.png,The guys in my crew always freak out over stuff that looks cool, but is kind of pointless. Like capes.
4-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:198,test:~clothing~:glasses=smiling.png,Will you be able to see the cards without your glasses? Or that I'm cheating? Hahah, that's a joke, I'm not cheating. Not that you'll be able to tell without glasses.
4-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:198,test:~clothing~:glasses=serious.png,Are those glasses necessary for your eyes, or just for show? You didn't seem to have much of a problem with taking them off.
4-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:198,test:~clothing~:glasses=seductive.png,Without glasses I can see you have nice eyes, ~player~.
4-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:149,test:~clothing~:gloves=smug.png,From now on, I'm gonna be watching your hands,  ~name~. I mean your actual hands, not your cards.
4-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:149,test:~clothing~:gloves=thinking.png,If your hands get cold, you're gonna regret taking off your gloves.
4-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:199,test:~clothing~:gloves=serious.png,Who wears gloves to a poker game? Sketchy people, that's who.
4-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:199,test:~clothing~:gloves=thinking.png,Why wear gloves to this game? Do you bite your nails and you didn't want us to see?
4-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:199,test:~clothing~:gloves=smug.png,Do you bite your nails, ~player~? You have reason to be nervous, so it makes sense.
4-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:150,test:~clothing~:hat=embarrassed.png,But he does let me hold on to it every now and then. I guess he trusts me.
4-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:150,test:~clothing~:hat=embarrassed.png,And then when something happens to it, he comes crying to me to fix it. It's kind of adorable, I'll admit.
4-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:200,test:~clothing~:hat=calm.png,Your hair got all messy when you removed your hat. Do you want a comb, ~player~?
4-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:200,test:~clothing~:hat=greedy.png,Awww, I was kinda hoping you kept something hidden under your hat. Like your money...
4-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:200,test:~clothing~:hat=thinking.png,If Luffy was playing strip poker, would he take off his hat? Eh... I don't know why that thought entered my head.
4-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:201,test:~clothing~:headphones=furious.png,You weren't listening to music with those headphones, right? It would mean you've been ignoring everything I've been saying this whole time.
4-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:201,test:~clothing~:headphones=smiling.png,Nice headphones. What kind of music do you listen to, ~player~?
4-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:201,test:~clothing~:headphones=serious.png,You've not been using those headphones for cheating, have you? Like for getting tips from a friend, or something? Hmmm...
4-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:203,test:~clothing~:kilt=thinking.png,So you wear a skirt... Are you an okama, ~player~?
4-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:203,test:~clothing~:kilt=thinking.png,I don't think I've seen a man wearing a skirt before. Well, unless you count the okama.
4-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:203,test:~clothing~:kilt=smiling.png,You must be a confident guy to wear a skirt. I mean, you must be proud of your legs.
4-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:151,test:~clothing~:necklace=smug.png,Stealing a necklace is not that hard... Eh? Who said that?
4-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:151,test:~clothing~:necklace=smug.png,You better hope your necklace is not too expensive. For no reason...
4-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:204,test:~clothing~:necklace=greedy.png,That necklace looks valuable. How expensive is it, ~player~? Eh... I just would like to buy one.
4-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:204,test:~clothing~:necklace=greedy.png,Is that stone on your necklace real, ~player~? It looks big.
4-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:204,test:~clothing~:necklace=greedy.png,Is that necklace a family jewel or something, ~player~? Cause if it doesn't have sentimental value...
4-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:152,test:~clothing~:scarf=thinking.png,But they really are fashionable, aren't they?
4-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:152,test:~clothing~:scarf=calm.png,But still, scarves are cute.
4-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:105,test:~clothing~:shoes=thinking.png,I've really gotten in the habit of wearing open-toed shoes recently. Maybe I should go shopping for new shoes soon...
4-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:105,test:~clothing~:shoes=annoyed.png,Now I always wear sandals or open-toed shoes. Too bad it always attracts the feet guys. I've never understood that fixation.
4-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:153,test:~clothing~:stockings=seductive.png,I doubt any men can resist a woman wearing stockings.
4-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:153,test:~clothing~:stockings=seductive.png,Stockings are irresistible. I should wear them more.
4-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:202,test:~clothing~:tie=smug.png,Look at you, Big Shot. Taking off your tie. Now you're just an average player.
4-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:202,test:~clothing~:tie=thinking.png,Aren't you thinking you'll look less professional without your tie.
4-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:202,test:~clothing~:tie=calm.png,Oh, I liked the tie. It really made you look like you knew what you were doing.
4-opponent_stripped,target:human,targetStatus:lost_all,saidMarker:target2,oneShotId:65,test:~target.gender~:female,marker:target2naked=thinking.png,(Hmmm, so ~player~ is now fully naked. Which means she only has to lose once more to be out. How am I going to do this?)
4-opponent_stripped,target:human,targetStatus:lost_all,saidMarker:target2,oneShotId:65,test:~target.gender~:female,marker:target2naked=thinking.png,(One more loss for ~player~, and she'll be out. Maybe I can "help" her with that. I don't want to do this to a woman, but this is about survival.)
4-opponent_stripped,target:human,targetStatus:lost_all,saidMarker:target2,oneShotId:63,test:~target.gender~:male,marker:target2naked=thinking.png,(Hmmm, so ~player~ is now fully naked. Which means he only has to lose once more to be out. How am I going to do this?)
4-opponent_stripped,target:human,targetStatus:lost_all,saidMarker:target2,oneShotId:63,test:~target.gender~:male,marker:target2naked=thinking.png,(One more loss for ~player~, and he'll be out. Maybe I can "help" him with that. I'm not happy about it, but it's my only choice.)
4-opponent_chest_will_be_visible,target:chihiro,id:41=shocked.png,Hey, where are you going? Huh?
4-opponent_chest_will_be_visible,target:lucina=serious.png,Come on, this isn't a big deal. I'm sure you've faced more dire situations than this one.
4-opponent_chest_is_visible,target:chihiro=serious.png,Hey, you can't replace yourself with... whatever that device is. It clearly isn't a Den Den Mushi. Either way, that's against the rules.
4-opponent_chest_is_visible,target:lucina=smiling.png,Well, if you're a warrior, bigger breasts probably wouldn't help you at all.
4-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:confident,oneShotId:113=serious.png,This is the moment your confidence is really put to the test, ~name~.
4-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:confident,oneShotId:113=serious.png,You seem pretty confident, ~name~. But still...
4-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:180=serious.png,Do you actually want to be naked? I don't get it.
4-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:180=serious.png,Why do you want to show your body so much? And why do you assume we want to see it?
4-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:shy,oneShotId:164=sad.png,Don't be so scared, ~name~. I wish I could do something for you, but...
4-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:shy,oneShotId:164=sad.png,I feel so bad for ~name~. This is not something one should be forced to do unless you want to.
4-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:shy,oneShotId:164=calm.png,You're confronting your fear, ~name~. I believe in you.
4-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chihiro=sad.png,I understand you're scared, but don't run away again, okay?
4-opponent_crotch_is_visible,target:chihiro,id:1=shocked.png,You're a guy? But you look so girly... I'm sorry, this just really caught me by surprise.
4-opponent_crotch_is_visible,target:chihiro,id:1=shocked.png,Oh, I didn't see this coming. You really look like a girl...
4-opponent_start_masturbating,target:human,saidMarker:target1end,oneShotId:16=calm.png,~Player~, I, eh... wasn't serious about what I said. I was using you to win the game. I'm really sorry, I promise I'll make it up to you after I win the game.
4-opponent_start_masturbating,target:human,saidMarker:target1end,oneShotId:16=calm.png,I have a confession. I was seducing you so I would have a better chance of winning the game. I'm really sorry, ~player~. But your sacrifice won't be in vain if I win. I promise you I won't forget.
4-opponent_start_masturbating,target:human,saidMarker:target2end,oneShotId:70=calm.png,I'll make it up to you, ~player~. Not with money, of course. Maybe I can get Sanji to cook you something, or...
4-opponent_start_masturbating,target:human,saidMarker:target2end,oneShotId:70=calm.png,Maybe I can do something for you, ~player~. Something other than giving you the prize, of course.  I could get Usopp to make something for you? Nah, that's too lame.
4-opponent_start_masturbating,target:lucina=shocked.png,Are you praying? You know the punishment for losing the game is a little different, right?
4-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:lucina,targetTimeInStage:0-,targetSaidMarker:finished,targetSayingMarker:sit_on_crate=shocked.png,Did you just yell out Robin? Oh, I guess that's a different Robin. Sorry, I have a friend named Robin too, so I got confused for second.

5-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:bounty_hunter,oneShotId:178=serious.png,Now that you know I'm a pirate, I hope you won't get any ideas, ~name~. Even if you managed to capture me, my crew won't stand idly by, and they'll come after you with all they have. That's just a friendly warning.

5-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:exotic_hair,oneShotId:167=thinking.png,That's a very unique hairstyle you have. It would be quite easy to identify you with that.

5-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:shy,oneShotId:237=sad.png,Aren't you a little too shy to play a game like this one? You should start with something easier, like regular poker.

5-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:seduction_final,oneShotId:15,marker:target1end=sad.png,Thank you, ~player~! You're the best, and you... lost. Uh...
5-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:seduction6,notSaidMarker:seduction6end,oneShotId:38,marker:seduction6end=embarrassed.png,Hey, I made it! Eh... about what I said, ~player~? Let's discuss it after the game. There's too many people here...
5-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:seduction6,notSaidMarker:seduction6end,oneShotId:38,marker:seduction6end=embarrassed.png,Yes! Oh, ~player~... You're busy stripping now, so why don't we leave the <i>thing</i> for later? Hm?
5-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:seduction6,notSaidMarker:seduction6end,oneShotId:38,marker:seduction6end=embarrassed.png,I did it? Yeah! ~player~? About what I said... let's do it after the game. You'd like to have more privacy too, right?
5-opponent_lost,target:lucina,targetStage:0=calm.png,Why the mask? Are you hiding something? I guess we all have something to hide.
5-opponent_lost,target:lucina,targetStage:4=thinking.png,Now that I look at you closer, Lucina... Are your eyes different from each other? They're not exactly the same color...
5-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:2,one-shot-id:77=thinking.png,Uff, you can't catch a break, huh?
5-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:2,one-shot-id:78=thinking.png,~Name~, didn't you lose the last round too?
5-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:2,one-shot-id:79=thinking.png,You lost again? That sucks... for you.
5-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:2,one-shot-id:80=thinking.png,Maybe you should've reviewed the rules before playing a game, ~name~.
5-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:3-=shocked.png,You're on the express train to full nudity.
5-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:3-=sad.png,How many losses in a row does this make? I feel bad for you.
5-opponent_lost,timeInStage:7-,oneShotId:94=smiling.png,Wow! I keep winning round after round. It almost seems like... magic!
5-opponent_stripping,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mask_falls,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:embarrassed,id:60=shocked.png,What's wrong? Mika, it's just a mask. You were already showing everything.
5-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip=thinking.png,So why can't you take off your own clothes, ~name~? I'm just curious.
5-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip=serious.png,You seem perfectly capable of undressing yourself, ~name~. That's just my opinion.
5-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip=thinking.png,Doesn't it take longer to have someone else remove your clothes for you?
5-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip=calm.png,I assume your partner knows everything you're wearing, huh?
5-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip=thinking.png,This is one way to have your friend participate without playing the game, I suppose.
5-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip,oneShotId:184,priority:151=thinking.png,So your friend will help you getting naked? Okaaay...
5-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip,oneShotId:184,priority:151=thinking.png,I see. So so you'll get help undressing...?
5-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Oh, at least we won't have to wait for the reveal. Whatever it is...
5-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:3=thinking.png,You're taking off your gloves, but you're still holding on to your sword. Hmmm...
5-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:108,test:~clothing~:armor=sad.png,Wearing armor must be the worst. You can barely move, and it's so heavy... Plus, most of them don't even look fashionable.
5-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:108,test:~clothing~:armor=sad.png,How uncomfortable is it to wear armor? Sure, it can save your life, but is it really worth it?
5-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:186,test:~clothing~:belt=calm.png,Cool belt. Not as cool as mine, but it's still nice.
5-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:186,test:~clothing~:belt=calm.png,Hmmm, where did you get that belt? Want me to tell you where I got mine so you can get a better looking one?
5-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:103,test:~clothing~:boots=calm.png,Those are some nice boots. I used to wear mine a lot in my pre pirate days.
5-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:103,test:~clothing~:boots=calm.png,Nice boots. I still have a pair or two, even though I don't wear them that much.
5-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:188,test:~clothing~:bracelets=calm.png,Do those bracelets have any significant value to you, ~name~? Mine has a lot of sentimental value. It's from my sister, Nojiko.
5-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:188,test:~clothing~:bracelets=calm.png,Are those bracelets important to you, ~name~? Mine sure is. My sister, Nojiko, gave it to me.
5-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:111,test:~clothing~:cape=thinking.png,I can't say I understand the point in wearing a cape. It must be so difficult to fight with that. What if it gets stuck in something?
5-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:111,test:~clothing~:cape=thinking.png,Why do you even wear a cape? Does it allow you to fly or something? I think it's a little too much.
5-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:106,test:~clothing~:gloves=serious.png,Now why would you wear gloves to a game of poker? Oh, because you knew you'd have to strip at one point and needed something extra to remove.
5-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:106,test:~clothing~:gloves=serious.png,Gloves would be the perfect piece of clothing to hide more cards in a game of poker. You just slip them right into your hand.
5-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:99,test:~clothing~:hat=smiling.png,My Captain has a hat. Do you also get super intense when someone takes it?
5-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:99,test:~clothing~:hat=smiling.png,If you're taking it off, I suppose that hat isn't very important for you. Like my Captain's hat.
5-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:107,test:~clothing~:necklace=greedy.png,That necklace... Is it valuable? I mean, real value. Not the sentimental kind.
5-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:107,test:~clothing~:necklace=greedy.png,Pretty necklace. And... expensive looking.
5-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:101,test:~clothing~:panties=serious.png,If Brook was here, he would be losing it now. Although his deal is seeing panties, not what's under them, isn't it? I really don't get it. Either way, he is a pervert.
5-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:101,test:~clothing~:panties=thinking.png,Panties are all Brook ever talks about. If he was here, would he be trying to steal them, or does he just want to see them?
5-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:101,test:~clothing~:panties=thinking.png,How many times have I punched Brook after he asks to see a girl's panties? I don't remember, but my knuckles hurt now.
5-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:110,test:~clothing~:scarf=smiling.png,I like scarves. Too bad I only get to wear one when I go to a winter island, or I'd look out of place.
5-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:110,test:~clothing~:scarf=smiling.png,Nice scarf, ~name~. I should get myself a similar one for the next time we sail to a winter island.
5-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:104,test:~clothing~:shoes=smug.png,No luck, no shoes, no prize! I'm joking, even without your shoes you can still win. But you won't!
5-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:104,test:~clothing~:shoes=smug.png,Be careful where you step now, ~name~. Because you're taking off your shoes, of course. I wasn't trying to threaten you, or something.
5-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:112,test:~clothing~:stockings=smiling.png,Aren't stockings nice? The perfect mix of sexy and cute.
5-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:112,test:~clothing~:stockings=smiling.png,Stocking are cute. Ah, so many adorable kind of clothing I could've worn for this game.
5-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:100,test:~clothing~:sword=thinking.png,Only one sword? I guess that's normal. Because of Zoro, I'm now used to people carrying around three swords.
5-opponent_stripped,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:embarrassed,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:putting_mask,id:61=sad.png,Wow. I guess you never really know a person's weakness until you see it.
5-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:197,count-role;target&character;human:,test:~clothing~:belt=smug.png,That's a boring belt; it doesn't even work as a holster. Relax, I'm just kidding.
5-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:197,count-role;target&character;human:,test:~clothing~:belt=thinking.png,Be careful your pants don't fall down without your belt.
5-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:197,count-role;target&character;human:,test:~clothing~:belt=smug.png,That belt came off very easy. Have you lost weight worrying about the game, ~player~?
5-opponent_stripped,filter:assisted_strip,oneShotId:185,priority:151=calm.png,Then you can't take off your own clothes? I've no problem with this, it just seems unnecessary.
5-opponent_stripped,filter:assisted_strip,oneShotId:185,priority:151=calm.png,This doesn't bother me, but I can't say I understand it.
5-opponent_stripped,target:human,targetStatus:lost_all,saidMarker:target1,oneShotId:12,marker:target1naked=smiling.png,Oh, now you're completely naked, ~player~. If you were to lose one more time...
5-opponent_stripped,target:human,targetStatus:lost_all,saidMarker:target1,oneShotId:12,marker:target1naked=serious.png,(One more loss, and ~player~ will be out of the game. I can do this.)
5-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:1,id:39=smiling.png,So you're a woman, huh? And you have a pretty face, that mask wasn't doing you any favors.
5-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:4=serious.png,Normally I'd be worried about something like that, but you don't seem like the kind of woman who'd use that sword unless there's a reason.
5-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:109,test:~clothing~:armor=smiling.png,Oh, not in your case, ~name~. Your armor looks great on you.
5-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:109,test:~clothing~:armor=smiling.png,Oh, but I'm not talking about your armor, ~name~. This one looks so good that it's a shame to see it go.
5-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:187,test:~clothing~:belt=smug.png,And my belt doubles as a holster for my Clima-Tact too. Now that's really cool.
5-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:187,test:~clothing~:belt=calm.png,I can also keep my Clima-Tact in my belt. What about yours, ~name~?
5-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:147,test:~clothing~:boots=thinking.png,Now I only have to wear boots when I go to a winter island, especially if it's winter there too. The rest of the time, it's not that cold.
5-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:147,test:~clothing~:boots=thinking.png,We don't sail to that many cold islands, so I can wear sandals most of the time.
5-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:189,test:~clothing~:bracelets=serious.png,I hope the staff here knows how to save our valuable items. Because if anything happens to my possessions I'll make them pay.
5-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:189,test:~clothing~:bracelets=serious.png,Who's in charge of protecting the items we remove while we continue playing? They better be qualified.
5-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:148,test:~clothing~:cape=serious.png,I suppose they look cool, but I've never cared for that. Only the guys freak out over stuff like that.
5-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:148,test:~clothing~:cape=serious.png,The guys in my crew always freak out over stuff that looks cool, but is kind of pointless. Like capes.
5-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:198,test:~clothing~:glasses=smiling.png,Will you be able to see the cards without your glasses? Or that I'm cheating? Hahah, that's a joke, I'm not cheating. Not that you'll be able to tell without glasses.
5-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:198,test:~clothing~:glasses=serious.png,Are those glasses necessary for your eyes, or just for show? You didn't seem to have much of a problem with taking them off.
5-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:198,test:~clothing~:glasses=seductive.png,Without glasses I can see you have nice eyes, ~player~.
5-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:149,test:~clothing~:gloves=smug.png,From now on, I'm gonna be watching your hands,  ~name~. I mean your actual hands, not your cards.
5-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:149,test:~clothing~:gloves=thinking.png,If your hands get cold, you're gonna regret taking off your gloves.
5-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:199,test:~clothing~:gloves=serious.png,Who wears gloves to a poker game? Sketchy people, that's who.
5-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:199,test:~clothing~:gloves=thinking.png,Why wear gloves to this game? Do you bite your nails and you didn't want us to see?
5-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:199,test:~clothing~:gloves=smug.png,Do you bite your nails, ~player~? You have reason to be nervous, so it makes sense.
5-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:150,test:~clothing~:hat=embarrassed.png,But he does let me hold on to it every now and then. I guess he trusts me.
5-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:150,test:~clothing~:hat=embarrassed.png,And then when something happens to it, he comes crying to me to fix it. It's kind of adorable, I'll admit.
5-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:200,test:~clothing~:hat=calm.png,Your hair got all messy when you removed your hat. Do you want a comb, ~player~?
5-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:200,test:~clothing~:hat=greedy.png,Awww, I was kinda hoping you kept something hidden under your hat. Like your money...
5-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:200,test:~clothing~:hat=thinking.png,If Luffy was playing strip poker, would he take off his hat? Eh... I don't know why that thought entered my head.
5-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:201,test:~clothing~:headphones=furious.png,You weren't listening to music with those headphones, right? It would mean you've been ignoring everything I've been saying this whole time.
5-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:201,test:~clothing~:headphones=smiling.png,Nice headphones. What kind of music do you listen to, ~player~?
5-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:201,test:~clothing~:headphones=serious.png,You've not been using those headphones for cheating, have you? Like for getting tips from a friend, or something? Hmmm...
5-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:203,test:~clothing~:kilt=thinking.png,So you wear a skirt... Are you an okama, ~player~?
5-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:203,test:~clothing~:kilt=thinking.png,I don't think I've seen a man wearing a skirt before. Well, unless you count the okama.
5-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:203,test:~clothing~:kilt=smiling.png,You must be a confident guy to wear a skirt. I mean, you must be proud of your legs.
5-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:151,test:~clothing~:necklace=smug.png,Stealing a necklace is not that hard... Eh? Who said that?
5-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:151,test:~clothing~:necklace=smug.png,You better hope your necklace is not too expensive. For no reason...
5-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:204,test:~clothing~:necklace=greedy.png,That necklace looks valuable. How expensive is it, ~player~? Eh... I just would like to buy one.
5-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:204,test:~clothing~:necklace=greedy.png,Is that stone on your necklace real, ~player~? It looks big.
5-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:204,test:~clothing~:necklace=greedy.png,Is that necklace a family jewel or something, ~player~? Cause if it doesn't have sentimental value...
5-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:152,test:~clothing~:scarf=thinking.png,But they really are fashionable, aren't they?
5-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:152,test:~clothing~:scarf=calm.png,But still, scarves are cute.
5-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:105,test:~clothing~:shoes=thinking.png,I've really gotten in the habit of wearing open-toed shoes recently. Maybe I should go shopping for new shoes soon...
5-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:105,test:~clothing~:shoes=annoyed.png,Now I always wear sandals or open-toed shoes. Too bad it always attracts the feet guys. I've never understood that fixation.
5-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:153,test:~clothing~:stockings=seductive.png,I doubt any men can resist a woman wearing stockings.
5-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:153,test:~clothing~:stockings=seductive.png,Stockings are irresistible. I should wear them more.
5-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:202,test:~clothing~:tie=smug.png,Look at you, Big Shot. Taking off your tie. Now you're just an average player.
5-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:202,test:~clothing~:tie=thinking.png,Aren't you thinking you'll look less professional without your tie.
5-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:202,test:~clothing~:tie=calm.png,Oh, I liked the tie. It really made you look like you knew what you were doing.
5-opponent_stripped,target:human,targetStatus:lost_all,saidMarker:target2,oneShotId:65,test:~target.gender~:female,marker:target2naked=thinking.png,(Hmmm, so ~player~ is now fully naked. Which means she only has to lose once more to be out. How am I going to do this?)
5-opponent_stripped,target:human,targetStatus:lost_all,saidMarker:target2,oneShotId:65,test:~target.gender~:female,marker:target2naked=thinking.png,(One more loss for ~player~, and she'll be out. Maybe I can "help" her with that. I don't want to do this to a woman, but this is about survival.)
5-opponent_stripped,target:human,targetStatus:lost_all,saidMarker:target2,oneShotId:63,test:~target.gender~:male,marker:target2naked=thinking.png,(Hmmm, so ~player~ is now fully naked. Which means he only has to lose once more to be out. How am I going to do this?)
5-opponent_stripped,target:human,targetStatus:lost_all,saidMarker:target2,oneShotId:63,test:~target.gender~:male,marker:target2naked=thinking.png,(One more loss for ~player~, and he'll be out. Maybe I can "help" him with that. I'm not happy about it, but it's my only choice.)
5-opponent_chest_will_be_visible,target:chihiro,id:41=shocked.png,Hey, where are you going? Huh?
5-opponent_chest_will_be_visible,target:lucina=serious.png,Come on, this isn't a big deal. I'm sure you've faced more dire situations than this one.
5-opponent_chest_is_visible,target:chihiro=serious.png,Hey, you can't replace yourself with... whatever that device is. It clearly isn't a Den Den Mushi. Either way, that's against the rules.
5-opponent_chest_is_visible,target:lucina=smiling.png,Well, if you're a warrior, bigger breasts probably wouldn't help you at all.
5-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:confident,oneShotId:113=serious.png,This is the moment your confidence is really put to the test, ~name~.
5-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:confident,oneShotId:113=serious.png,You seem pretty confident, ~name~. But still...
5-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:180=serious.png,Do you actually want to be naked? I don't get it.
5-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:180=serious.png,Why do you want to show your body so much? And why do you assume we want to see it?
5-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:shy,oneShotId:164=sad.png,Don't be so scared, ~name~. I wish I could do something for you, but...
5-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:shy,oneShotId:164=sad.png,I feel so bad for ~name~. This is not something one should be forced to do unless you want to.
5-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:shy,oneShotId:164=calm.png,You're confronting your fear, ~name~. I believe in you.
5-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chihiro=sad.png,I understand you're scared, but don't run away again, okay?
5-opponent_crotch_is_visible,target:chihiro,id:1=shocked.png,You're a guy? But you look so girly... I'm sorry, this just really caught me by surprise.
5-opponent_crotch_is_visible,target:chihiro,id:1=shocked.png,Oh, I didn't see this coming. You really look like a girl...
5-opponent_start_masturbating,target:human,saidMarker:target1end,oneShotId:16=calm.png,~Player~, I, eh... wasn't serious about what I said. I was using you to win the game. I'm really sorry, I promise I'll make it up to you after I win the game.
5-opponent_start_masturbating,target:human,saidMarker:target1end,oneShotId:16=calm.png,I have a confession. I was seducing you so I would have a better chance of winning the game. I'm really sorry, ~player~. But your sacrifice won't be in vain if I win. I promise you I won't forget.
5-opponent_start_masturbating,target:human,saidMarker:target2end,oneShotId:70=calm.png,I'll make it up to you, ~player~. Not with money, of course. Maybe I can get Sanji to cook you something, or...
5-opponent_start_masturbating,target:human,saidMarker:target2end,oneShotId:70=calm.png,Maybe I can do something for you, ~player~. Something other than giving you the prize, of course.  I could get Usopp to make something for you? Nah, that's too lame.
5-opponent_start_masturbating,target:lucina=shocked.png,Are you praying? You know the punishment for losing the game is a little different, right?
5-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:lucina,targetTimeInStage:0-,targetSaidMarker:finished,targetSayingMarker:sit_on_crate=shocked.png,Did you just yell out Robin? Oh, I guess that's a different Robin. Sorry, I have a friend named Robin too, so I got confused for second.

-3-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:exotic_hair,oneShotId:167=thinking.png,That's a very unique hairstyle you have. It would be quite easy to identify you with that.
-3-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:fancy,oneShotId:172=greedy.png,You're rich, aren't you? You don't have to tell me. Are you looking for some new friends, ~name~?
-3-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:fancy,oneShotId:172,one-shot-id:6=greedy.png,Those clothes... You must be rich, huh? I hope we can be friends, ~name~. For no reason in particular, heheh.
-3-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:hero,oneShotId:166,priority:225=smiling.png,I can tell you're a good person, ~name~. I hope we can get along.
-3-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:hero,oneShotId:166,priority:225,one-shot-id:2=calm.png,It seems to me your heart is in the right place. If I don't win this game, I hope you do. But I'm really gonna win!
-3-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:musician,oneShotId:175,priority:240=smiling.png,You play music, ~name~? I wonder if you have anything to teach Brook. I doubt it, he's really good. Though I probably wouldn't say it to his face.
-3-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:musician,oneShotId:175,priority:240=smiling.png,You're a musician, huh? My crew mate, Brook, plays... pretty much every instrument. And don't tell him I said this, but he's really good.
-3-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:pirate,oneShotId:176=smiling.png,So we're both pirates. But there's no reason why we couldn't get along, huh? You don't seem that bad.
-3-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:pirate,oneShotId:176=smiling.png,Pirates playing poker. Normally this wouldn't end well for any of us, but you don't seem too bad to me, ~name~.
-3-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:shy,oneShotId:237=greedy.png,Why did you come to play this game if you're so scared of losing? Oh, it must be because of the prize. I get you.
-3-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:shy,oneShotId:237=sad.png,Aren't you a little too shy to play a game like this one? You should start with something easier, like regular poker.
-3-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:very_long_hair,oneShotId:174,priority:220=thinking.png,How do you even take care of hair that long? Doesn't it get tangled everywhere?
-3-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:very_long_hair,oneShotId:174,priority:220=thinking.png,I could never have hair that long. I'd probably trip on it everytime I walk.
-3-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:villain,oneShotId:173,priority:235=serious.png,(I have a feeling this person is bad news. I better watch out.)
-3-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:villain,oneShotId:173,priority:235=serious.png,(There's something about ~name~ I just don't like. But I better be careful not to say anything to indicate that.)
-3-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:weapon,oneShotId:169,priority:225=thinking.png,Why would you even bring a weapon to a poker game? Oh, I did bring my Clima-Tact, heheh...
-3-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:weapon,oneShotId:169,priority:225=calm.png,I hope you have no intention of using that weapon, or there will be trouble. And I'll be out of here.
-3-opponent_lost,hasHand:High Card,oneShotId:190=smiling.png,Oh, man. This sure was a lucky break for me.
-3-opponent_lost,hasHand:High Card,oneShotId:190=happy.png,Heheh, it took a lot of luck for me not to lose this round.
-3-opponent_lost,hasHand:High Card,oneShotId:190=happy.png,I didn't lose? Yay!
-3-opponent_lost,target:chihiro,targetStage:0=sad.png,You look way too young and innocent. I'm not looking forward to seeing you lose, little girl.
-3-opponent_lost,target:chihiro,targetStage:4=sad.png,Calm down, young lady. Breathe in, breathe out...
-3-opponent_lost,target:chihiro,targetStage:5=serious.png,Ah, you finally came back. You owe us all an apology.
-3-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:last_round=smug.png,Oh, yeah! Sorry, I'm just happy I won. I meant what I said, though. This was a fun game, ~player~.
-3-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:manipulation_final,oneShotId:68,marker:target2end=calm.png,Oh, you... lost? That's good, I was worried for your health, and... I'm sorry, that wasn't very nice of me.
-3-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:manipulation_final,oneShotId:68,marker:target2end=sad.png,You actually lost? Is it because of what I said? M-maybe you won't really get sick, and... I'm sorry, I guess this is my fault.
-3-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:manipulation7,notSaidMarker:manipulation7end,oneShotId:60,marker:manipulation7end=smiling.png,Wow, did that really work? I should try telling the truth more often.
-3-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:manipulation7,notSaidMarker:manipulation7end,oneShotId:60,marker:manipulation7end=serious.png,Really? Lying never got me anything, but telling the truth does? Hmmm...
-3-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:manipulation7,notSaidMarker:manipulation7end,oneShotId:60,marker:manipulation7end=calm.png,Being honest worked? Seriously? It must just be a fluke...
-3-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:seduction_final,oneShotId:15,marker:target1end=sad.png,Yes! Thank you, ~player~! Oh. Eh...
-3-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:seduction_final,oneShotId:15,marker:target1end=sad.png,~Player~ lost! Yeah! Hmm...
-3-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:seduction_final,oneShotId:15,marker:target1end=sad.png,Thank you, ~player~! You're the best, and you... lost. Uh...
-3-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:seduction7,notSaidMarker:seduction7end,oneShotId:11,marker:seduction7end=happy.png,Yes, I'm saved! Thank you, ~player~. How can I repay you? Oh, I already said it, didn't I? Well, we'll talk about that later.
-3-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:seduction7,notSaidMarker:seduction7end,oneShotId:11,marker:seduction7end=smiling.png,Heheh, I didn't lose! And it's thanks to you, ~player~. Did you because of what I said? That was... Well, let's talk about it later.
-3-opponent_lost,target:human,saidMarker:seduction7,notSaidMarker:seduction7end,oneShotId:11,marker:seduction7end=happy.png,I didn't lose, woohoo! Eh... let's talk about the thing I just said later. I'd like to have the chance to... get ready first.
-3-opponent_lost,target:lucina,targetStage:0=calm.png,Why the mask? Are you hiding something? I guess we all have something to hide.
-3-opponent_lost,target:lucina,targetStage:4=thinking.png,Now that I look at you closer, Lucina... Are your eyes different from each other? They're not exactly the same color...
-3-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:2,one-shot-id:77=thinking.png,Uff, you can't catch a break, huh?
-3-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:2,one-shot-id:78=thinking.png,~Name~, didn't you lose the last round too?
-3-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:2,one-shot-id:79=thinking.png,You lost again? That sucks... for you.
-3-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:2,one-shot-id:80=thinking.png,Maybe you should've reviewed the rules before playing a game, ~name~.
-3-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:3-=shocked.png,You're on the express train to full nudity.
-3-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:3-=sad.png,How many losses in a row does this make? I feel bad for you.
-3-opponent_lost,timeInStage:7-,oneShotId:94=smiling.png,Wow! I keep winning round after round. It almost seems like... magic!
-3-opponent_stripping,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mask_falls,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:embarrassed,id:60=shocked.png,What's wrong? Mika, it's just a mask. You were already showing everything.
-3-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip=thinking.png,So why can't you take off your own clothes, ~name~? I'm just curious.
-3-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip=serious.png,You seem perfectly capable of undressing yourself, ~name~. That's just my opinion.
-3-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip=thinking.png,Doesn't it take longer to have someone else remove your clothes for you?
-3-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip=calm.png,I assume your partner knows everything you're wearing, huh?
-3-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip=thinking.png,This is one way to have your friend participate without playing the game, I suppose.
-3-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip,oneShotId:184,priority:151=thinking.png,So your friend will help you getting naked? Okaaay...
-3-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip,oneShotId:184,priority:151=thinking.png,I see. So so you'll get help undressing...?
-3-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Oh, at least we won't have to wait for the reveal. Whatever it is...
-3-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:3=thinking.png,You're taking off your gloves, but you're still holding on to your sword. Hmmm...
-3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:108,test:~clothing~:armor=sad.png,Wearing armor must be the worst. You can barely move, and it's so heavy... Plus, most of them don't even look fashionable.
-3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:108,test:~clothing~:armor=sad.png,How uncomfortable is it to wear armor? Sure, it can save your life, but is it really worth it?
-3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:186,test:~clothing~:belt=calm.png,Cool belt. Not as cool as mine, but it's still nice.
-3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:186,test:~clothing~:belt=calm.png,Hmmm, where did you get that belt? Want me to tell you where I got mine so you can get a better looking one?
-3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:103,test:~clothing~:boots=calm.png,Those are some nice boots. I used to wear mine a lot in my pre pirate days.
-3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:103,test:~clothing~:boots=calm.png,Nice boots. I still have a pair or two, even though I don't wear them that much.
-3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:188,test:~clothing~:bracelets=calm.png,Do those bracelets have any significant value to you, ~name~? Mine has a lot of sentimental value. It's from my sister, Nojiko.
-3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:188,test:~clothing~:bracelets=calm.png,Are those bracelets important to you, ~name~? Mine sure is. My sister, Nojiko, gave it to me.
-3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:111,test:~clothing~:cape=thinking.png,I can't say I understand the point in wearing a cape. It must be so difficult to fight with that. What if it gets stuck in something?
-3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:111,test:~clothing~:cape=thinking.png,Why do you even wear a cape? Does it allow you to fly or something? I think it's a little too much.
-3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:106,test:~clothing~:gloves=serious.png,Now why would you wear gloves to a game of poker? Oh, because you knew you'd have to strip at one point and needed something extra to remove.
-3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:106,test:~clothing~:gloves=serious.png,Gloves would be the perfect piece of clothing to hide more cards in a game of poker. You just slip them right into your hand.
-3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:99,test:~clothing~:hat=smiling.png,My Captain has a hat. Do you also get super intense when someone takes it?
-3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:99,test:~clothing~:hat=smiling.png,If you're taking it off, I suppose that hat isn't very important for you. Like my Captain's hat.
-3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:107,test:~clothing~:necklace=greedy.png,That necklace... Is it valuable? I mean, real value. Not the sentimental kind.
-3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:107,test:~clothing~:necklace=greedy.png,Pretty necklace. And... expensive looking.
-3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:101,test:~clothing~:panties=serious.png,If Brook was here, he would be losing it now. Although his deal is seeing panties, not what's under them, isn't it? I really don't get it. Either way, he is a pervert.
-3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:101,test:~clothing~:panties=thinking.png,Panties are all Brook ever talks about. If he was here, would he be trying to steal them, or does he just want to see them?
-3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:101,test:~clothing~:panties=thinking.png,How many times have I punched Brook after he asks to see a girl's panties? I don't remember, but my knuckles hurt now.
-3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:110,test:~clothing~:scarf=smiling.png,I like scarves. Too bad I only get to wear one when I go to a winter island, or I'd look out of place.
-3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:110,test:~clothing~:scarf=smiling.png,Nice scarf, ~name~. I should get myself a similar one for the next time we sail to a winter island.
-3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:104,test:~clothing~:shoes=smug.png,No luck, no shoes, no prize! I'm joking, even without your shoes you can still win. But you won't!
-3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:104,test:~clothing~:shoes=smug.png,Be careful where you step now, ~name~. Because you're taking off your shoes, of course. I wasn't trying to threaten you, or something.
-3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:112,test:~clothing~:stockings=smiling.png,Aren't stockings nice? The perfect mix of sexy and cute.
-3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:112,test:~clothing~:stockings=smiling.png,Stocking are cute. Ah, so many adorable kind of clothing I could've worn for this game.
-3-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:100,test:~clothing~:sword=thinking.png,Only one sword? I guess that's normal. Because of Zoro, I'm now used to people carrying around three swords.
-3-opponent_stripped,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:embarrassed,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:putting_mask,id:61=sad.png,Wow. I guess you never really know a person's weakness until you see it.
-3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:197,count-role;target&character;human:,test:~clothing~:belt=smug.png,That's a boring belt; it doesn't even work as a holster. Relax, I'm just kidding.
-3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:197,count-role;target&character;human:,test:~clothing~:belt=thinking.png,Be careful your pants don't fall down without your belt.
-3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:197,count-role;target&character;human:,test:~clothing~:belt=smug.png,That belt came off very easy. Have you lost weight worrying about the game, ~player~?
-3-opponent_stripped,filter:assisted_strip,oneShotId:185,priority:151=calm.png,Then you can't take off your own clothes? I've no problem with this, it just seems unnecessary.
-3-opponent_stripped,filter:assisted_strip,oneShotId:185,priority:151=calm.png,This doesn't bother me, but I can't say I understand it.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:human,targetStatus:lost_all,saidMarker:target1,oneShotId:12,marker:target1naked=smiling.png,Oh, now you're completely naked, ~player~. If you were to lose one more time...
-3-opponent_stripped,target:human,targetStatus:lost_all,saidMarker:target1,oneShotId:12,marker:target1naked=serious.png,(One more loss, and ~player~ will be out of the game. I can do this.)
-3-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:1,id:39=smiling.png,So you're a woman, huh? And you have a pretty face, that mask wasn't doing you any favors.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:4=serious.png,Normally I'd be worried about something like that, but you don't seem like the kind of woman who'd use that sword unless there's a reason.
-3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:109,test:~clothing~:armor=smiling.png,Oh, not in your case, ~name~. Your armor looks great on you.
-3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:109,test:~clothing~:armor=smiling.png,Oh, but I'm not talking about your armor, ~name~. This one looks so good that it's a shame to see it go.
-3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:187,test:~clothing~:belt=smug.png,And my belt doubles as a holster for my Clima-Tact too. Now that's really cool.
-3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:187,test:~clothing~:belt=calm.png,I can also keep my Clima-Tact in my belt. What about yours, ~name~?
-3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:147,test:~clothing~:boots=thinking.png,Now I only have to wear boots when I go to a winter island, especially if it's winter there too. The rest of the time, it's not that cold.
-3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:147,test:~clothing~:boots=thinking.png,We don't sail to that many cold islands, so I can wear sandals most of the time.
-3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:189,test:~clothing~:bracelets=serious.png,I hope the staff here knows how to save our valuable items. Because if anything happens to my possessions I'll make them pay.
-3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:189,test:~clothing~:bracelets=serious.png,Who's in charge of protecting the items we remove while we continue playing? They better be qualified.
-3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:148,test:~clothing~:cape=serious.png,I suppose they look cool, but I've never cared for that. Only the guys freak out over stuff like that.
-3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:148,test:~clothing~:cape=serious.png,The guys in my crew always freak out over stuff that looks cool, but is kind of pointless. Like capes.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:198,test:~clothing~:glasses=smiling.png,Will you be able to see the cards without your glasses? Or that I'm cheating? Hahah, that's a joke, I'm not cheating. Not that you'll be able to tell without glasses.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:198,test:~clothing~:glasses=serious.png,Are those glasses necessary for your eyes, or just for show? You didn't seem to have much of a problem with taking them off.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:198,test:~clothing~:glasses=seductive.png,Without glasses I can see you have nice eyes, ~player~.
-3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:149,test:~clothing~:gloves=smug.png,From now on, I'm gonna be watching your hands,  ~name~. I mean your actual hands, not your cards.
-3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:149,test:~clothing~:gloves=thinking.png,If your hands get cold, you're gonna regret taking off your gloves.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:199,test:~clothing~:gloves=serious.png,Who wears gloves to a poker game? Sketchy people, that's who.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:199,test:~clothing~:gloves=thinking.png,Why wear gloves to this game? Do you bite your nails and you didn't want us to see?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:199,test:~clothing~:gloves=smug.png,Do you bite your nails, ~player~? You have reason to be nervous, so it makes sense.
-3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:150,test:~clothing~:hat=embarrassed.png,But he does let me hold on to it every now and then. I guess he trusts me.
-3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:150,test:~clothing~:hat=embarrassed.png,And then when something happens to it, he comes crying to me to fix it. It's kind of adorable, I'll admit.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:200,test:~clothing~:hat=calm.png,Your hair got all messy when you removed your hat. Do you want a comb, ~player~?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:200,test:~clothing~:hat=greedy.png,Awww, I was kinda hoping you kept something hidden under your hat. Like your money...
-3-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:200,test:~clothing~:hat=thinking.png,If Luffy was playing strip poker, would he take off his hat? Eh... I don't know why that thought entered my head.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:201,test:~clothing~:headphones=furious.png,You weren't listening to music with those headphones, right? It would mean you've been ignoring everything I've been saying this whole time.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:201,test:~clothing~:headphones=smiling.png,Nice headphones. What kind of music do you listen to, ~player~?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:201,test:~clothing~:headphones=serious.png,You've not been using those headphones for cheating, have you? Like for getting tips from a friend, or something? Hmmm...
-3-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:203,test:~clothing~:kilt=thinking.png,So you wear a skirt... Are you an okama, ~player~?
-3-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:203,test:~clothing~:kilt=thinking.png,I don't think I've seen a man wearing a skirt before. Well, unless you count the okama.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:203,test:~clothing~:kilt=smiling.png,You must be a confident guy to wear a skirt. I mean, you must be proud of your legs.
-3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:151,test:~clothing~:necklace=smug.png,Stealing a necklace is not that hard... Eh? Who said that?
-3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:151,test:~clothing~:necklace=smug.png,You better hope your necklace is not too expensive. For no reason...
-3-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:204,test:~clothing~:necklace=greedy.png,That necklace looks valuable. How expensive is it, ~player~? Eh... I just would like to buy one.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:204,test:~clothing~:necklace=greedy.png,Is that stone on your necklace real, ~player~? It looks big.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:204,test:~clothing~:necklace=greedy.png,Is that necklace a family jewel or something, ~player~? Cause if it doesn't have sentimental value...
-3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:152,test:~clothing~:scarf=thinking.png,But they really are fashionable, aren't they?
-3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:152,test:~clothing~:scarf=calm.png,But still, scarves are cute.
-3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:105,test:~clothing~:shoes=thinking.png,I've really gotten in the habit of wearing open-toed shoes recently. Maybe I should go shopping for new shoes soon...
-3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:105,test:~clothing~:shoes=annoyed.png,Now I always wear sandals or open-toed shoes. Too bad it always attracts the feet guys. I've never understood that fixation.
-3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:153,test:~clothing~:stockings=seductive.png,I doubt any men can resist a woman wearing stockings.
-3-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:153,test:~clothing~:stockings=seductive.png,Stockings are irresistible. I should wear them more.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:202,test:~clothing~:tie=smug.png,Look at you, Big Shot. Taking off your tie. Now you're just an average player.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:202,test:~clothing~:tie=thinking.png,Aren't you thinking you'll look less professional without your tie.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:202,test:~clothing~:tie=calm.png,Oh, I liked the tie. It really made you look like you knew what you were doing.
-3-opponent_stripped,target:human,targetStatus:lost_all,saidMarker:target2,oneShotId:65,test:~target.gender~:female,marker:target2naked=thinking.png,(Hmmm, so ~player~ is now fully naked. Which means she only has to lose once more to be out. How am I going to do this?)
-3-opponent_stripped,target:human,targetStatus:lost_all,saidMarker:target2,oneShotId:65,test:~target.gender~:female,marker:target2naked=thinking.png,(One more loss for ~player~, and she'll be out. Maybe I can "help" her with that. I don't want to do this to a woman, but this is about survival.)
-3-opponent_stripped,target:human,targetStatus:lost_all,saidMarker:target2,oneShotId:63,test:~target.gender~:male,marker:target2naked=thinking.png,(Hmmm, so ~player~ is now fully naked. Which means he only has to lose once more to be out. How am I going to do this?)
-3-opponent_stripped,target:human,targetStatus:lost_all,saidMarker:target2,oneShotId:63,test:~target.gender~:male,marker:target2naked=thinking.png,(One more loss for ~player~, and he'll be out. Maybe I can "help" him with that. I'm not happy about it, but it's my only choice.)
-3-opponent_chest_will_be_visible,target:chihiro,id:41=shocked.png,Hey, where are you going? Huh?
-3-opponent_chest_will_be_visible,target:lucina=serious.png,Come on, this isn't a big deal. I'm sure you've faced more dire situations than this one.
-3-opponent_chest_is_visible,target:chihiro=serious.png,Hey, you can't replace yourself with... whatever that device is. It clearly isn't a Den Den Mushi. Either way, that's against the rules.
-3-opponent_chest_is_visible,target:lucina=smiling.png,Well, if you're a warrior, bigger breasts probably wouldn't help you at all.
-3-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:confident,oneShotId:113=serious.png,This is the moment your confidence is really put to the test, ~name~.
-3-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:confident,oneShotId:113=serious.png,You seem pretty confident, ~name~. But still...
-3-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:180=serious.png,Do you actually want to be naked? I don't get it.
-3-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:180=serious.png,Why do you want to show your body so much? And why do you assume we want to see it?
-3-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:shy,oneShotId:164=sad.png,Don't be so scared, ~name~. I wish I could do something for you, but...
-3-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:shy,oneShotId:164=sad.png,I feel so bad for ~name~. This is not something one should be forced to do unless you want to.
-3-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:shy,oneShotId:164=calm.png,You're confronting your fear, ~name~. I believe in you.
-3-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chihiro=sad.png,I understand you're scared, but don't run away again, okay?
-3-opponent_crotch_is_visible,target:chihiro,id:1=shocked.png,You're a guy? But you look so girly... I'm sorry, this just really caught me by surprise.
-3-opponent_crotch_is_visible,target:chihiro,id:1=shocked.png,Oh, I didn't see this coming. You really look like a girl...
-3-opponent_start_masturbating,target:human,saidMarker:target1end,oneShotId:16=calm.png,~Player~, I, eh... wasn't serious about what I said. I was using you to win the game. I'm really sorry, I promise I'll make it up to you after I win the game.
-3-opponent_start_masturbating,target:human,saidMarker:target1end,oneShotId:16=calm.png,I have a confession. I was seducing you so I would have a better chance of winning the game. I'm really sorry, ~player~. But your sacrifice won't be in vain if I win. I promise you I won't forget.
-3-opponent_start_masturbating,target:human,saidMarker:target2end,oneShotId:70=calm.png,I'll make it up to you, ~player~. Not with money, of course. Maybe I can get Sanji to cook you something, or...
-3-opponent_start_masturbating,target:human,saidMarker:target2end,oneShotId:70=calm.png,Maybe I can do something for you, ~player~. Something other than giving you the prize, of course.  I could get Usopp to make something for you? Nah, that's too lame.
-3-opponent_start_masturbating,target:lucina=shocked.png,Are you praying? You know the punishment for losing the game is a little different, right?
-3-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:lucina,targetTimeInStage:0-,targetSaidMarker:finished,targetSayingMarker:sit_on_crate=shocked.png,Did you just yell out Robin? Oh, I guess that's a different Robin. Sorry, I have a friend named Robin too, so I got confused for second.

-2-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:bounty_hunter,oneShotId:178=smiling.png,Now you know there's a bounty on me, but aren't you here to relax, ~name~? If you want to capture me, you can do it after the game. (When I'll be long gone.)
-2-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:bounty_hunter,oneShotId:178=serious.png,Now that you know I'm a pirate, I hope you won't get any ideas, ~name~. Even if you managed to capture me, my crew won't stand idly by, and they'll come after you with all they have. That's just a friendly warning.
-2-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:exotic_hair,oneShotId:167=calm.png,I've met people with weird hairstyles, but wow...
-2-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:exotic_hair,oneShotId:167=thinking.png,That's a very unique hairstyle you have. It would be quite easy to identify you with that.
-2-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:fancy,oneShotId:172=greedy.png,You're rich, aren't you? You don't have to tell me. Are you looking for some new friends, ~name~?
-2-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:fancy,oneShotId:172,one-shot-id:6=greedy.png,Those clothes... You must be rich, huh? I hope we can be friends, ~name~. For no reason in particular, heheh.
-2-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:musician,oneShotId:175,priority:240=smiling.png,You play music, ~name~? I wonder if you have anything to teach Brook. I doubt it, he's really good. Though I probably wouldn't say it to his face.
-2-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:musician,oneShotId:175,priority:240=smiling.png,You're a musician, huh? My crew mate, Brook, plays... pretty much every instrument. And don't tell him I said this, but he's really good.
-2-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:pirate,oneShotId:176=smiling.png,So we're both pirates. But there's no reason why we couldn't get along, huh? You don't seem that bad.
-2-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:pirate,oneShotId:176=smiling.png,Pirates playing poker. Normally this wouldn't end well for any of us, but you don't seem too bad to me, ~name~.
-2-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:shy,oneShotId:237=greedy.png,Why did you come to play this game if you're so scared of losing? Oh, it must be because of the prize. I get you.
-2-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:shy,oneShotId:237=sad.png,Aren't you a little too shy to play a game like this one? You should start with something easier, like regular poker.
-2-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:very_long_hair,oneShotId:174,priority:220=thinking.png,How do you even take care of hair that long? Doesn't it get tangled everywhere?
-2-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:very_long_hair,oneShotId:174,priority:220=thinking.png,I could never have hair that long. I'd probably trip on it everytime I walk.
-2-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:villain,oneShotId:173,priority:235=serious.png,(I have a feeling this person is bad news. I better watch out.)
-2-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:villain,oneShotId:173,priority:235=serious.png,(There's something about ~name~ I just don't like. But I better be careful not to say anything to indicate that.)
-2-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:weapon,oneShotId:169,priority:225=thinking.png,Why would you even bring a weapon to a poker game? Oh, I did bring my Clima-Tact, heheh...
-2-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:weapon,oneShotId:169,priority:225=calm.png,I hope you have no intention of using that weapon, or there will be trouble. And I'll be out of here.
-2-opponent_lost,target:chihiro,targetStage:0=sad.png,You look way too young and innocent. I'm not looking forward to seeing you lose, little girl.
-2-opponent_lost,target:chihiro,targetStage:4=sad.png,Calm down, young lady. Breathe in, breathe out...
-2-opponent_lost,target:chihiro,targetStage:5=serious.png,Ah, you finally came back. You owe us all an apology.
-2-opponent_lost,target:lucina,targetStage:0=calm.png,Why the mask? Are you hiding something? I guess we all have something to hide.
-2-opponent_lost,target:lucina,targetStage:4=thinking.png,Now that I look at you closer, Lucina... Are your eyes different from each other? They're not exactly the same color...
-2-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:2,one-shot-id:77=thinking.png,Uff, you can't catch a break, huh?
-2-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:2,one-shot-id:78=thinking.png,~Name~, didn't you lose the last round too?
-2-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:2,one-shot-id:79=thinking.png,You lost again? That sucks... for you.
-2-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:2,one-shot-id:80=thinking.png,Maybe you should've reviewed the rules before playing a game, ~name~.
-2-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:3-=shocked.png,You're on the express train to full nudity.
-2-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:3-=sad.png,How many losses in a row does this make? I feel bad for you.
-2-opponent_stripping,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mask_falls,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:embarrassed,id:60=shocked.png,What's wrong? Mika, it's just a mask. You were already showing everything.
-2-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip=thinking.png,So why can't you take off your own clothes, ~name~? I'm just curious.
-2-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip=serious.png,You seem perfectly capable of undressing yourself, ~name~. That's just my opinion.
-2-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip=thinking.png,Doesn't it take longer to have someone else remove your clothes for you?
-2-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip=calm.png,I assume your partner knows everything you're wearing, huh?
-2-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip=thinking.png,This is one way to have your friend participate without playing the game, I suppose.
-2-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip,oneShotId:184,priority:151=thinking.png,So your friend will help you getting naked? Okaaay...
-2-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip,oneShotId:184,priority:151=thinking.png,I see. So so you'll get help undressing...?
-2-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Oh, at least we won't have to wait for the reveal. Whatever it is...
-2-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:3=thinking.png,You're taking off your gloves, but you're still holding on to your sword. Hmmm...
-2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:108,test:~clothing~:armor=sad.png,Wearing armor must be the worst. You can barely move, and it's so heavy... Plus, most of them don't even look fashionable.
-2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:108,test:~clothing~:armor=sad.png,How uncomfortable is it to wear armor? Sure, it can save your life, but is it really worth it?
-2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:186,test:~clothing~:belt=calm.png,Cool belt. Not as cool as mine, but it's still nice.
-2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:186,test:~clothing~:belt=calm.png,Hmmm, where did you get that belt? Want me to tell you where I got mine so you can get a better looking one?
-2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:103,test:~clothing~:boots=calm.png,Those are some nice boots. I used to wear mine a lot in my pre pirate days.
-2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:103,test:~clothing~:boots=calm.png,Nice boots. I still have a pair or two, even though I don't wear them that much.
-2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:188,test:~clothing~:bracelets=calm.png,Do those bracelets have any significant value to you, ~name~? Mine has a lot of sentimental value. It's from my sister, Nojiko.
-2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:188,test:~clothing~:bracelets=calm.png,Are those bracelets important to you, ~name~? Mine sure is. My sister, Nojiko, gave it to me.
-2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:111,test:~clothing~:cape=thinking.png,I can't say I understand the point in wearing a cape. It must be so difficult to fight with that. What if it gets stuck in something?
-2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:111,test:~clothing~:cape=thinking.png,Why do you even wear a cape? Does it allow you to fly or something? I think it's a little too much.
-2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:106,test:~clothing~:gloves=serious.png,Now why would you wear gloves to a game of poker? Oh, because you knew you'd have to strip at one point and needed something extra to remove.
-2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:106,test:~clothing~:gloves=serious.png,Gloves would be the perfect piece of clothing to hide more cards in a game of poker. You just slip them right into your hand.
-2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:99,test:~clothing~:hat=smiling.png,My Captain has a hat. Do you also get super intense when someone takes it?
-2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:99,test:~clothing~:hat=smiling.png,If you're taking it off, I suppose that hat isn't very important for you. Like my Captain's hat.
-2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:107,test:~clothing~:necklace=greedy.png,That necklace... Is it valuable? I mean, real value. Not the sentimental kind.
-2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:107,test:~clothing~:necklace=greedy.png,Pretty necklace. And... expensive looking.
-2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:101,test:~clothing~:panties=serious.png,If Brook was here, he would be losing it now. Although his deal is seeing panties, not what's under them, isn't it? I really don't get it. Either way, he is a pervert.
-2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:101,test:~clothing~:panties=thinking.png,Panties are all Brook ever talks about. If he was here, would he be trying to steal them, or does he just want to see them?
-2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:101,test:~clothing~:panties=thinking.png,How many times have I punched Brook after he asks to see a girl's panties? I don't remember, but my knuckles hurt now.
-2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:110,test:~clothing~:scarf=smiling.png,I like scarves. Too bad I only get to wear one when I go to a winter island, or I'd look out of place.
-2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:110,test:~clothing~:scarf=smiling.png,Nice scarf, ~name~. I should get myself a similar one for the next time we sail to a winter island.
-2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:104,test:~clothing~:shoes=smug.png,No luck, no shoes, no prize! I'm joking, even without your shoes you can still win. But you won't!
-2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:104,test:~clothing~:shoes=smug.png,Be careful where you step now, ~name~. Because you're taking off your shoes, of course. I wasn't trying to threaten you, or something.
-2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:112,test:~clothing~:stockings=smiling.png,Aren't stockings nice? The perfect mix of sexy and cute.
-2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:112,test:~clothing~:stockings=smiling.png,Stocking are cute. Ah, so many adorable kind of clothing I could've worn for this game.
-2-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:100,test:~clothing~:sword=thinking.png,Only one sword? I guess that's normal. Because of Zoro, I'm now used to people carrying around three swords.
-2-opponent_stripped,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:embarrassed,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:putting_mask,id:61=sad.png,Wow. I guess you never really know a person's weakness until you see it.
-2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:197,count-role;target&character;human:,test:~clothing~:belt=smug.png,That's a boring belt; it doesn't even work as a holster. Relax, I'm just kidding.
-2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:197,count-role;target&character;human:,test:~clothing~:belt=thinking.png,Be careful your pants don't fall down without your belt.
-2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:197,count-role;target&character;human:,test:~clothing~:belt=smug.png,That belt came off very easy. Have you lost weight worrying about the game, ~player~?
-2-opponent_stripped,filter:assisted_strip,oneShotId:185,priority:151=calm.png,Then you can't take off your own clothes? I've no problem with this, it just seems unnecessary.
-2-opponent_stripped,filter:assisted_strip,oneShotId:185,priority:151=calm.png,This doesn't bother me, but I can't say I understand it.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:1,id:39=smiling.png,So you're a woman, huh? And you have a pretty face, that mask wasn't doing you any favors.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:4=serious.png,Normally I'd be worried about something like that, but you don't seem like the kind of woman who'd use that sword unless there's a reason.
-2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:109,test:~clothing~:armor=smiling.png,Oh, not in your case, ~name~. Your armor looks great on you.
-2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:109,test:~clothing~:armor=smiling.png,Oh, but I'm not talking about your armor, ~name~. This one looks so good that it's a shame to see it go.
-2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:187,test:~clothing~:belt=smug.png,And my belt doubles as a holster for my Clima-Tact too. Now that's really cool.
-2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:187,test:~clothing~:belt=calm.png,I can also keep my Clima-Tact in my belt. What about yours, ~name~?
-2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:147,test:~clothing~:boots=thinking.png,Now I only have to wear boots when I go to a winter island, especially if it's winter there too. The rest of the time, it's not that cold.
-2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:147,test:~clothing~:boots=thinking.png,We don't sail to that many cold islands, so I can wear sandals most of the time.
-2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:189,test:~clothing~:bracelets=serious.png,I hope the staff here knows how to save our valuable items. Because if anything happens to my possessions I'll make them pay.
-2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:189,test:~clothing~:bracelets=serious.png,Who's in charge of protecting the items we remove while we continue playing? They better be qualified.
-2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:148,test:~clothing~:cape=serious.png,I suppose they look cool, but I've never cared for that. Only the guys freak out over stuff like that.
-2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:148,test:~clothing~:cape=serious.png,The guys in my crew always freak out over stuff that looks cool, but is kind of pointless. Like capes.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:198,test:~clothing~:glasses=smiling.png,Will you be able to see the cards without your glasses? Or that I'm cheating? Hahah, that's a joke, I'm not cheating. Not that you'll be able to tell without glasses.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:198,test:~clothing~:glasses=serious.png,Are those glasses necessary for your eyes, or just for show? You didn't seem to have much of a problem with taking them off.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:198,test:~clothing~:glasses=seductive.png,Without glasses I can see you have nice eyes, ~player~.
-2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:149,test:~clothing~:gloves=smug.png,From now on, I'm gonna be watching your hands,  ~name~. I mean your actual hands, not your cards.
-2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:149,test:~clothing~:gloves=thinking.png,If your hands get cold, you're gonna regret taking off your gloves.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:199,test:~clothing~:gloves=serious.png,Who wears gloves to a poker game? Sketchy people, that's who.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:199,test:~clothing~:gloves=thinking.png,Why wear gloves to this game? Do you bite your nails and you didn't want us to see?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:199,test:~clothing~:gloves=smug.png,Do you bite your nails, ~player~? You have reason to be nervous, so it makes sense.
-2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:150,test:~clothing~:hat=embarrassed.png,But he does let me hold on to it every now and then. I guess he trusts me.
-2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:150,test:~clothing~:hat=embarrassed.png,And then when something happens to it, he comes crying to me to fix it. It's kind of adorable, I'll admit.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:200,test:~clothing~:hat=calm.png,Your hair got all messy when you removed your hat. Do you want a comb, ~player~?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:200,test:~clothing~:hat=greedy.png,Awww, I was kinda hoping you kept something hidden under your hat. Like your money...
-2-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:200,test:~clothing~:hat=thinking.png,If Luffy was playing strip poker, would he take off his hat? Eh... I don't know why that thought entered my head.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:201,test:~clothing~:headphones=furious.png,You weren't listening to music with those headphones, right? It would mean you've been ignoring everything I've been saying this whole time.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:201,test:~clothing~:headphones=smiling.png,Nice headphones. What kind of music do you listen to, ~player~?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:201,test:~clothing~:headphones=serious.png,You've not been using those headphones for cheating, have you? Like for getting tips from a friend, or something? Hmmm...
-2-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:203,test:~clothing~:kilt=thinking.png,So you wear a skirt... Are you an okama, ~player~?
-2-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:203,test:~clothing~:kilt=thinking.png,I don't think I've seen a man wearing a skirt before. Well, unless you count the okama.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:203,test:~clothing~:kilt=smiling.png,You must be a confident guy to wear a skirt. I mean, you must be proud of your legs.
-2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:151,test:~clothing~:necklace=smug.png,Stealing a necklace is not that hard... Eh? Who said that?
-2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:151,test:~clothing~:necklace=smug.png,You better hope your necklace is not too expensive. For no reason...
-2-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:204,test:~clothing~:necklace=greedy.png,That necklace looks valuable. How expensive is it, ~player~? Eh... I just would like to buy one.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:204,test:~clothing~:necklace=greedy.png,Is that stone on your necklace real, ~player~? It looks big.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:204,test:~clothing~:necklace=greedy.png,Is that necklace a family jewel or something, ~player~? Cause if it doesn't have sentimental value...
-2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:152,test:~clothing~:scarf=thinking.png,But they really are fashionable, aren't they?
-2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:152,test:~clothing~:scarf=calm.png,But still, scarves are cute.
-2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:105,test:~clothing~:shoes=thinking.png,I've really gotten in the habit of wearing open-toed shoes recently. Maybe I should go shopping for new shoes soon...
-2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:105,test:~clothing~:shoes=annoyed.png,Now I always wear sandals or open-toed shoes. Too bad it always attracts the feet guys. I've never understood that fixation.
-2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:153,test:~clothing~:stockings=seductive.png,I doubt any men can resist a woman wearing stockings.
-2-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:153,test:~clothing~:stockings=seductive.png,Stockings are irresistible. I should wear them more.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:202,test:~clothing~:tie=smug.png,Look at you, Big Shot. Taking off your tie. Now you're just an average player.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:202,test:~clothing~:tie=thinking.png,Aren't you thinking you'll look less professional without your tie.
-2-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:202,test:~clothing~:tie=calm.png,Oh, I liked the tie. It really made you look like you knew what you were doing.
-2-opponent_chest_will_be_visible,target:chihiro,id:41=shocked.png,Hey, where are you going? Huh?
-2-opponent_chest_will_be_visible,target:lucina=serious.png,Come on, this isn't a big deal. I'm sure you've faced more dire situations than this one.
-2-opponent_chest_is_visible,target:chihiro=serious.png,Hey, you can't replace yourself with... whatever that device is. It clearly isn't a Den Den Mushi. Either way, that's against the rules.
-2-opponent_chest_is_visible,target:lucina=smiling.png,Well, if you're a warrior, bigger breasts probably wouldn't help you at all.
-2-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:confident,oneShotId:113=serious.png,This is the moment your confidence is really put to the test, ~name~.
-2-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:confident,oneShotId:113=serious.png,You seem pretty confident, ~name~. But still...
-2-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:180=serious.png,Do you actually want to be naked? I don't get it.
-2-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:180=serious.png,Why do you want to show your body so much? And why do you assume we want to see it?
-2-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:shy,oneShotId:164=sad.png,Don't be so scared, ~name~. I wish I could do something for you, but...
-2-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:shy,oneShotId:164=sad.png,I feel so bad for ~name~. This is not something one should be forced to do unless you want to.
-2-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:shy,oneShotId:164=calm.png,You're confronting your fear, ~name~. I believe in you.
-2-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chihiro=sad.png,I understand you're scared, but don't run away again, okay?
-2-opponent_crotch_is_visible,target:chihiro,id:1=shocked.png,You're a guy? But you look so girly... I'm sorry, this just really caught me by surprise.
-2-opponent_crotch_is_visible,target:chihiro,id:1=shocked.png,Oh, I didn't see this coming. You really look like a girl...
-2-opponent_start_masturbating,target:lucina=shocked.png,Are you praying? You know the punishment for losing the game is a little different, right?
-2-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:lucina,targetTimeInStage:0-,targetSaidMarker:finished,targetSayingMarker:sit_on_crate=shocked.png,Did you just yell out Robin? Oh, I guess that's a different Robin. Sorry, I have a friend named Robin too, so I got confused for second.

-1-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:fancy,oneShotId:172,one-shot-id:6=greedy.png,Those clothes... You must be rich, huh? I hope we can be friends, ~name~. For no reason in particular, heheh.
-1-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:musician,oneShotId:175,priority:240=smiling.png,You play music, ~name~? I wonder if you have anything to teach Brook. I doubt it, he's really good. Though I probably wouldn't say it to his face.
-1-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:musician,oneShotId:175,priority:240=smiling.png,You're a musician, huh? My crew mate, Brook, plays... pretty much every instrument. And don't tell him I said this, but he's really good.
-1-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:pirate,oneShotId:176=smiling.png,So we're both pirates. But there's no reason why we couldn't get along, huh? You don't seem that bad.
-1-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:pirate,oneShotId:176=smiling.png,Pirates playing poker. Normally this wouldn't end well for any of us, but you don't seem too bad to me, ~name~.
-1-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:shy,oneShotId:237=greedy.png,Why did you come to play this game if you're so scared of losing? Oh, it must be because of the prize. I get you.
-1-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:shy,oneShotId:237=sad.png,Aren't you a little too shy to play a game like this one? You should start with something easier, like regular poker.
-1-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:very_long_hair,oneShotId:174,priority:220=thinking.png,How do you even take care of hair that long? Doesn't it get tangled everywhere?
-1-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:very_long_hair,oneShotId:174,priority:220=thinking.png,I could never have hair that long. I'd probably trip on it everytime I walk.
-1-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:villain,oneShotId:173,priority:235=serious.png,(I have a feeling this person is bad news. I better watch out.)
-1-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:villain,oneShotId:173,priority:235=serious.png,(There's something about ~name~ I just don't like. But I better be careful not to say anything to indicate that.)
-1-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:weapon,oneShotId:169,priority:225=thinking.png,Why would you even bring a weapon to a poker game? Oh, I did bring my Clima-Tact, heheh...
-1-opponent_lost,targetStage:0,filter:weapon,oneShotId:169,priority:225=calm.png,I hope you have no intention of using that weapon, or there will be trouble. And I'll be out of here.
-1-opponent_lost,target:chihiro,targetStage:0=sad.png,You look way too young and innocent. I'm not looking forward to seeing you lose, little girl.
-1-opponent_lost,target:chihiro,targetStage:4=sad.png,Calm down, young lady. Breathe in, breathe out...
-1-opponent_lost,target:chihiro,targetStage:5=serious.png,Ah, you finally came back. You owe us all an apology.
-1-opponent_lost,target:lucina,targetStage:0=calm.png,Why the mask? Are you hiding something? I guess we all have something to hide.
-1-opponent_lost,target:lucina,targetStage:4=thinking.png,Now that I look at you closer, Lucina... Are your eyes different from each other? They're not exactly the same color...
-1-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:2,one-shot-id:77=thinking.png,Uff, you can't catch a break, huh?
-1-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:2,one-shot-id:78=thinking.png,~Name~, didn't you lose the last round too?
-1-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:2,one-shot-id:79=thinking.png,You lost again? That sucks... for you.
-1-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:2,one-shot-id:80=thinking.png,Maybe you should've reviewed the rules before playing a game, ~name~.
-1-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:3-=shocked.png,You're on the express train to full nudity.
-1-opponent_lost,targetStatus:not_lost_all,consecutiveLosses:3-=sad.png,How many losses in a row does this make? I feel bad for you.
-1-opponent_stripping,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:mask_falls,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:embarrassed,id:60=shocked.png,What's wrong? Mika, it's just a mask. You were already showing everything.
-1-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip=thinking.png,So why can't you take off your own clothes, ~name~? I'm just curious.
-1-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip=serious.png,You seem perfectly capable of undressing yourself, ~name~. That's just my opinion.
-1-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip=thinking.png,Doesn't it take longer to have someone else remove your clothes for you?
-1-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip=calm.png,I assume your partner knows everything you're wearing, huh?
-1-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip=thinking.png,This is one way to have your friend participate without playing the game, I suppose.
-1-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip,oneShotId:184,priority:151=thinking.png,So your friend will help you getting naked? Okaaay...
-1-opponent_stripping,filter:assisted_strip,oneShotId:184,priority:151=thinking.png,I see. So so you'll get help undressing...?
-1-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:0=thinking.png,Oh, at least we won't have to wait for the reveal. Whatever it is...
-1-opponent_stripping,target:lucina,targetStage:3=thinking.png,You're taking off your gloves, but you're still holding on to your sword. Hmmm...
-1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:108,test:~clothing~:armor=sad.png,Wearing armor must be the worst. You can barely move, and it's so heavy... Plus, most of them don't even look fashionable.
-1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:108,test:~clothing~:armor=sad.png,How uncomfortable is it to wear armor? Sure, it can save your life, but is it really worth it?
-1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:186,test:~clothing~:belt=calm.png,Cool belt. Not as cool as mine, but it's still nice.
-1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:186,test:~clothing~:belt=calm.png,Hmmm, where did you get that belt? Want me to tell you where I got mine so you can get a better looking one?
-1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:103,test:~clothing~:boots=calm.png,Those are some nice boots. I used to wear mine a lot in my pre pirate days.
-1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:103,test:~clothing~:boots=calm.png,Nice boots. I still have a pair or two, even though I don't wear them that much.
-1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:188,test:~clothing~:bracelets=calm.png,Do those bracelets have any significant value to you, ~name~? Mine has a lot of sentimental value. It's from my sister, Nojiko.
-1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:188,test:~clothing~:bracelets=calm.png,Are those bracelets important to you, ~name~? Mine sure is. My sister, Nojiko, gave it to me.
-1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:111,test:~clothing~:cape=thinking.png,I can't say I understand the point in wearing a cape. It must be so difficult to fight with that. What if it gets stuck in something?
-1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:111,test:~clothing~:cape=thinking.png,Why do you even wear a cape? Does it allow you to fly or something? I think it's a little too much.
-1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:106,test:~clothing~:gloves=serious.png,Now why would you wear gloves to a game of poker? Oh, because you knew you'd have to strip at one point and needed something extra to remove.
-1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:106,test:~clothing~:gloves=serious.png,Gloves would be the perfect piece of clothing to hide more cards in a game of poker. You just slip them right into your hand.
-1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:99,test:~clothing~:hat=smiling.png,My Captain has a hat. Do you also get super intense when someone takes it?
-1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:99,test:~clothing~:hat=smiling.png,If you're taking it off, I suppose that hat isn't very important for you. Like my Captain's hat.
-1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:107,test:~clothing~:necklace=greedy.png,That necklace... Is it valuable? I mean, real value. Not the sentimental kind.
-1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:107,test:~clothing~:necklace=greedy.png,Pretty necklace. And... expensive looking.
-1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:101,test:~clothing~:panties=serious.png,If Brook was here, he would be losing it now. Although his deal is seeing panties, not what's under them, isn't it? I really don't get it. Either way, he is a pervert.
-1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:101,test:~clothing~:panties=thinking.png,Panties are all Brook ever talks about. If he was here, would he be trying to steal them, or does he just want to see them?
-1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:101,test:~clothing~:panties=thinking.png,How many times have I punched Brook after he asks to see a girl's panties? I don't remember, but my knuckles hurt now.
-1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:110,test:~clothing~:scarf=smiling.png,I like scarves. Too bad I only get to wear one when I go to a winter island, or I'd look out of place.
-1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:110,test:~clothing~:scarf=smiling.png,Nice scarf, ~name~. I should get myself a similar one for the next time we sail to a winter island.
-1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:104,test:~clothing~:shoes=smug.png,No luck, no shoes, no prize! I'm joking, even without your shoes you can still win. But you won't!
-1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:104,test:~clothing~:shoes=smug.png,Be careful where you step now, ~name~. Because you're taking off your shoes, of course. I wasn't trying to threaten you, or something.
-1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:112,test:~clothing~:stockings=smiling.png,Aren't stockings nice? The perfect mix of sexy and cute.
-1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:112,test:~clothing~:stockings=smiling.png,Stocking are cute. Ah, so many adorable kind of clothing I could've worn for this game.
-1-opponent_stripping,oneShotId:100,test:~clothing~:sword=thinking.png,Only one sword? I guess that's normal. Because of Zoro, I'm now used to people carrying around three swords.
-1-opponent_stripped,alsoPlaying:rainbow_mika,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:embarrassed,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:putting_mask,id:61=sad.png,Wow. I guess you never really know a person's weakness until you see it.
-1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:197,count-role;target&character;human:,test:~clothing~:belt=smug.png,That's a boring belt; it doesn't even work as a holster. Relax, I'm just kidding.
-1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:197,count-role;target&character;human:,test:~clothing~:belt=thinking.png,Be careful your pants don't fall down without your belt.
-1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:197,count-role;target&character;human:,test:~clothing~:belt=smug.png,That belt came off very easy. Have you lost weight worrying about the game, ~player~?
-1-opponent_stripped,filter:assisted_strip,oneShotId:185,priority:151=calm.png,Then you can't take off your own clothes? I've no problem with this, it just seems unnecessary.
-1-opponent_stripped,filter:assisted_strip,oneShotId:185,priority:151=calm.png,This doesn't bother me, but I can't say I understand it.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:1,id:39=smiling.png,So you're a woman, huh? And you have a pretty face, that mask wasn't doing you any favors.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:lucina,targetStage:4=serious.png,Normally I'd be worried about something like that, but you don't seem like the kind of woman who'd use that sword unless there's a reason.
-1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:109,test:~clothing~:armor=smiling.png,Oh, not in your case, ~name~. Your armor looks great on you.
-1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:109,test:~clothing~:armor=smiling.png,Oh, but I'm not talking about your armor, ~name~. This one looks so good that it's a shame to see it go.
-1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:187,test:~clothing~:belt=smug.png,And my belt doubles as a holster for my Clima-Tact too. Now that's really cool.
-1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:187,test:~clothing~:belt=calm.png,I can also keep my Clima-Tact in my belt. What about yours, ~name~?
-1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:147,test:~clothing~:boots=thinking.png,Now I only have to wear boots when I go to a winter island, especially if it's winter there too. The rest of the time, it's not that cold.
-1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:147,test:~clothing~:boots=thinking.png,We don't sail to that many cold islands, so I can wear sandals most of the time.
-1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:189,test:~clothing~:bracelets=serious.png,I hope the staff here knows how to save our valuable items. Because if anything happens to my possessions I'll make them pay.
-1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:189,test:~clothing~:bracelets=serious.png,Who's in charge of protecting the items we remove while we continue playing? They better be qualified.
-1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:148,test:~clothing~:cape=serious.png,I suppose they look cool, but I've never cared for that. Only the guys freak out over stuff like that.
-1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:148,test:~clothing~:cape=serious.png,The guys in my crew always freak out over stuff that looks cool, but is kind of pointless. Like capes.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:198,test:~clothing~:glasses=smiling.png,Will you be able to see the cards without your glasses? Or that I'm cheating? Hahah, that's a joke, I'm not cheating. Not that you'll be able to tell without glasses.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:198,test:~clothing~:glasses=serious.png,Are those glasses necessary for your eyes, or just for show? You didn't seem to have much of a problem with taking them off.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:198,test:~clothing~:glasses=seductive.png,Without glasses I can see you have nice eyes, ~player~.
-1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:149,test:~clothing~:gloves=smug.png,From now on, I'm gonna be watching your hands,  ~name~. I mean your actual hands, not your cards.
-1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:149,test:~clothing~:gloves=thinking.png,If your hands get cold, you're gonna regret taking off your gloves.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:199,test:~clothing~:gloves=serious.png,Who wears gloves to a poker game? Sketchy people, that's who.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:199,test:~clothing~:gloves=thinking.png,Why wear gloves to this game? Do you bite your nails and you didn't want us to see?
-1-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:199,test:~clothing~:gloves=smug.png,Do you bite your nails, ~player~? You have reason to be nervous, so it makes sense.
-1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:150,test:~clothing~:hat=embarrassed.png,But he does let me hold on to it every now and then. I guess he trusts me.
-1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:150,test:~clothing~:hat=embarrassed.png,And then when something happens to it, he comes crying to me to fix it. It's kind of adorable, I'll admit.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:200,test:~clothing~:hat=calm.png,Your hair got all messy when you removed your hat. Do you want a comb, ~player~?
-1-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:200,test:~clothing~:hat=greedy.png,Awww, I was kinda hoping you kept something hidden under your hat. Like your money...
-1-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:200,test:~clothing~:hat=thinking.png,If Luffy was playing strip poker, would he take off his hat? Eh... I don't know why that thought entered my head.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:201,test:~clothing~:headphones=furious.png,You weren't listening to music with those headphones, right? It would mean you've been ignoring everything I've been saying this whole time.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:201,test:~clothing~:headphones=smiling.png,Nice headphones. What kind of music do you listen to, ~player~?
-1-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:201,test:~clothing~:headphones=serious.png,You've not been using those headphones for cheating, have you? Like for getting tips from a friend, or something? Hmmm...
-1-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:203,test:~clothing~:kilt=thinking.png,So you wear a skirt... Are you an okama, ~player~?
-1-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:203,test:~clothing~:kilt=thinking.png,I don't think I've seen a man wearing a skirt before. Well, unless you count the okama.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:203,test:~clothing~:kilt=smiling.png,You must be a confident guy to wear a skirt. I mean, you must be proud of your legs.
-1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:151,test:~clothing~:necklace=smug.png,Stealing a necklace is not that hard... Eh? Who said that?
-1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:151,test:~clothing~:necklace=smug.png,You better hope your necklace is not too expensive. For no reason...
-1-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:204,test:~clothing~:necklace=greedy.png,That necklace looks valuable. How expensive is it, ~player~? Eh... I just would like to buy one.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:204,test:~clothing~:necklace=greedy.png,Is that stone on your necklace real, ~player~? It looks big.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:204,test:~clothing~:necklace=greedy.png,Is that necklace a family jewel or something, ~player~? Cause if it doesn't have sentimental value...
-1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:152,test:~clothing~:scarf=thinking.png,But they really are fashionable, aren't they?
-1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:152,test:~clothing~:scarf=calm.png,But still, scarves are cute.
-1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:105,test:~clothing~:shoes=thinking.png,I've really gotten in the habit of wearing open-toed shoes recently. Maybe I should go shopping for new shoes soon...
-1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:105,test:~clothing~:shoes=annoyed.png,Now I always wear sandals or open-toed shoes. Too bad it always attracts the feet guys. I've never understood that fixation.
-1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:153,test:~clothing~:stockings=seductive.png,I doubt any men can resist a woman wearing stockings.
-1-opponent_stripped,oneShotId:153,test:~clothing~:stockings=seductive.png,Stockings are irresistible. I should wear them more.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:202,test:~clothing~:tie=smug.png,Look at you, Big Shot. Taking off your tie. Now you're just an average player.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:202,test:~clothing~:tie=thinking.png,Aren't you thinking you'll look less professional without your tie.
-1-opponent_stripped,target:human,oneShotId:202,test:~clothing~:tie=calm.png,Oh, I liked the tie. It really made you look like you knew what you were doing.
-1-opponent_chest_will_be_visible,target:chihiro,id:41=shocked.png,Hey, where are you going? Huh?
-1-opponent_chest_will_be_visible,target:lucina=serious.png,Come on, this isn't a big deal. I'm sure you've faced more dire situations than this one.
-1-opponent_chest_is_visible,target:chihiro=serious.png,Hey, you can't replace yourself with... whatever that device is. It clearly isn't a Den Den Mushi. Either way, that's against the rules.
-1-opponent_chest_is_visible,target:lucina=smiling.png,Well, if you're a warrior, bigger breasts probably wouldn't help you at all.
-1-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:confident,oneShotId:113=serious.png,This is the moment your confidence is really put to the test, ~name~.
-1-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:confident,oneShotId:113=serious.png,You seem pretty confident, ~name~. But still...
-1-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:180=serious.png,Do you actually want to be naked? I don't get it.
-1-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:180=serious.png,Why do you want to show your body so much? And why do you assume we want to see it?
-1-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:shy,oneShotId:164=sad.png,Don't be so scared, ~name~. I wish I could do something for you, but...
-1-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:shy,oneShotId:164=sad.png,I feel so bad for ~name~. This is not something one should be forced to do unless you want to.
-1-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:shy,oneShotId:164=calm.png,You're confronting your fear, ~name~. I believe in you.
-1-opponent_crotch_will_be_visible,target:chihiro=sad.png,I understand you're scared, but don't run away again, okay?
-1-opponent_crotch_is_visible,target:chihiro,id:1=shocked.png,You're a guy? But you look so girly... I'm sorry, this just really caught me by surprise.
-1-opponent_crotch_is_visible,target:chihiro,id:1=shocked.png,Oh, I didn't see this coming. You really look like a girl...
-1-opponent_start_masturbating,target:lucina=shocked.png,Are you praying? You know the punishment for losing the game is a little different, right?
-1-opponent_finished_masturbating,target:lucina,targetTimeInStage:0-,targetSaidMarker:finished,targetSayingMarker:sit_on_crate=shocked.png,Did you just yell out Robin? Oh, I guess that's a different Robin. Sorry, I have a friend named Robin too, so I got confused for second.




#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written
male_must_masturbate=smiling.png,You lost? I wish I could say you put up a fight, but... you didn't.
male_must_masturbate=thinking.png,How long did it take you to lose? Not much...
male_start_masturbating=serious.png,I still don't understand why the loser has to do this. I didn't come here to see this.
male_start_masturbating=sad.png,Uhhh, I forgot about this part. Be strong, ~name~. But not too strong, or you might suffer some damage.
male_masturbating=smiling.png,I guess men look kind of adorable when they do this.
male_masturbating=annoyed.png,Are you trying to distract me from the game, ~name~? It's not working.
male_masturbating=furious.png,Aren't you looking at me a little too much, ~name~?
male_masturbating=calm.png,Hey, shouldn't you save some of that energy for later?
male_masturbating=serious.png,I'm getting uneasy if I look at ~name~ too much.
male_finished_masturbating=embarrassed.png,Heheh, that was... something.
male_finished_masturbating=shocked.png,Did you finish? Oh, yes. You did...
female_must_masturbate=sad.png,Uhh... I'm not sure I want to watch this.
female_must_masturbate=sad.png,The rules of this game should be revisited. But I guess it wouldn't be <i>Strip</i> Poker anymore. Just... Poker.
female_start_masturbating=shocked.png,What if <i>I</i> lose the game? I'm too refined to do this in public... No! I'm going to win!
female_start_masturbating=serious.png,No respectable woman would do something like this in front of so many people. No offense, ~name~.
female_masturbating=sad.png,How is ~name~ okay with everyone looking at her in this situation?
female_masturbating=thinking.png,So many eyes are on ~name~. Maybe I should do something for her...
female_masturbating=calm.png,You don't seem to be doing too bad, ~name~.
female_masturbating=smiling.png,I had my doubts, but it seems you're leaning into this pretty well.
female_masturbating=serious.png,Isn't it distracting to continue playing when the others are... busy?
female_masturbating=annoyed.png,Even if you're forced to do this, would a respectable lady would run away before being seen like this?
female_heavy_masturbating=shocked.png,~Name~? Are you okay?
female_heavy_masturbating=thinking.png,Oh, wow... I wasn't expecting ~name~ to get into this so much.
female_heavy_masturbating=annoyed.png,Hey, ~name~... Control yourself, people are looking at you.
female_finished_masturbating=shocked.png,I didn't think you'd finish that... intensely.
female_finished_masturbating=thinking.png,Uhhh... Remember to wash your hands before you leave.

0-male_must_masturbate=embarrassed.png,Heheh, I wanted to defeat you, ~name~, but not by <i>this</i> margin.
0-male_must_masturbate=thinking.png,You lost already? You're such a simpleton. Just like Luffy.
0-male_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;ryuji:=smiling.png,Too bad for you, Ryuji. I have nothing against you really.
0-male_must_masturbate,target:pit=smiling.png,Your move, Pit. And no flying away, mister! Just kidding, I know you can't fly with those wings.
0-male_must_masturbate,totalFinished:0,oneShotId:123=happy.png,And the first one is out! That wasn't so hard.
0-male_must_masturbate,totalFinished:0,oneShotId:123=smiling.png,Well played, ~name~. Now you can gather your clothes and leave.
0-male_must_masturbate,totalFinished:0,oneShotId:123=smiling.png,You gave it your best, didn't you? Then there's no reason to feel down. All you lost is that we saw you naked.
0-male_start_masturbating=sad.png,Alright. Get on with it, I guess.
0-male_start_masturbating=serious.png,Still, I never asked for <i>this</i>.
0-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;ryuji:=smug.png,But I gotta say... it's a little refreshing to see a man embarrassed in this position. At least that means you're not a huge pervert.
0-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;n:=happy.png,Oh, that sure is a nice looking chair. Too bad it's too big to take it with me.
0-male_start_masturbating,target:pit=sad.png,Sorry, I didn't mean to kick you when you're down.
0-male_start_masturbating,oneShotId:162,priority:1,test:~target.size~:large=thinking.png,Don't you need bigger hands to match the size of your... member? Or is this gonna be a challenge?
0-male_start_masturbating,oneShotId:162,priority:1,test:~target.size~:large=embarrassed.png,I doubt it can get any bigger, no matter how much you touch it.
0-male_start_masturbating,oneShotId:162,priority:1,test:~target.size~:large=smiling.png,So, is this the normal method? Or do you have to do it a different way because of how big it is?
0-male_start_masturbating,oneShotId:161,priority:1,test:~target.size~:small=thinking.png,Are you sure you won't have a problem with this? I mean, because of the small size of your...
0-male_start_masturbating,oneShotId:161,priority:1,test:~target.size~:small=embarrassed.png,Will it really become bigger after he touches it? Cause it was pretty small and... Oh, sorry. I was thinking out loud.
0-male_start_masturbating,totalFinished:1,oneShotId:124=shocked.png,Whoa, what are you doing?! Oh, right. I forgot about this part of the game.
0-male_start_masturbating,totalFinished:1,oneShotId:124=shocked.png,Hey, where are you touching...?! Oh, I forgot for a minute you now have to do <i>that</i>.
0-male_start_masturbating,totalFinished:1,oneShotId:124=shocked.png,Hey, do that outside! Oh, of course... I forgot that's part of the game. I just thought you were showing us your perverted side for no reason.
0-male_masturbating,target:human,saidMarker:target1,priority:0=annoyed.png,What are you doing, ~player~? How would you like it if I touched myself while looking at you? Ugh, bad example...
0-male_finished_masturbating=smiling.png,You started and finished before I've even stripped once. I don't know if you should feel proud of yourself.
0-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;dust:=sad.png,Oh, you got that all over your fur.
0-male_finished_masturbating,target:kamina=shocked.png,Did you. uh... <i>finish</i> multiple times? I didn't know men could...

0-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;lotte:=shocked.png,A crystal ball? What do you need that for?
0-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;sola:,id:75=calm.png,Sola lost? Wait, that's that crystal for?
0-female_must_masturbate,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:182=thinking.png,Congratulations? You wanted to lose, didn't you?
0-female_must_masturbate,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:182=thinking.png,I guess you won whatever game you were playing.
0-female_must_masturbate,filter:villain,oneShotId:193=smug.png,Normally I would feel bad for a woman losing this game, but I don't think you deserve my sympathy, ~name~.

0-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=sad.png,What are you gonna use your ability for now? I'm scared...
0-female_must_masturbate,target:cammy_white=sad.png,Oh, hey... Don't cry, Cammy. I know we didn't get along at first, but you can do this.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=shocked.png,What is that portal?! Did you do it?
0-female_must_masturbate,target:futaba=embarrassed.png,You're younger than me, but you're still taking this a lot better than I would, Futaba.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:juri=serious.png,You don't look even the least bit worried that you lost.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=sad.png,Your turn, Misato. Wait, are you drunk?
0-female_must_masturbate,target:navi=sad.png,Eh... Those look like those weird seeds Usopp uses for fighting, the ones that sprout giant plants.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:nayru,targetSayingMarker:n_forfeit=shocked.png,G-go away, strange black thing! Leave Nayru alone!
0-female_must_masturbate,target:remilia=shocked.png,You lost? Eh... seeing you fly with those wings is so creepy. They're just like a bat's.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:rin=sad.png,Oh, you lost Rin. Ehm... how are you gonna do this?
0-female_must_masturbate,target:sayaka=smug.png,You should've paid more attention to the game instead of focusing on this hypothetical witch.
0-female_must_masturbate,target:shimakaze=shocked.png,SHIMAKAZE!
0-female_must_masturbate,target:weiss_schnee=annoyed.png,Oh, come on. Don't pretend like you've never done this just because you're rich and fancy.
0-female_must_masturbate,totalMasturbating:0,oneShotId:24=sad.png,You lost! Bye, ~name~... Oh, right. I forgot you have to... pay. But you're not gonna do it, are you?
0-female_must_masturbate,totalMasturbating:0,oneShotId:24=shocked.png,H-hey, are you really gonna do this? What if we just leave the game here? I don't care about the prize that much.
0-female_must_masturbate,totalMasturbating:0,oneShotId:24=shocked.png,Hey! You don't have to do this, ~name~. It's not worth it.
0-female_start_masturbating=serious.png,Anyway, hopefully you'll get through this with no issues, ~name~.
0-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie:,id:69=annoyed.png,A balloon? Are you seriously gonna use a balloon for...? Okay...
0-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;lotte:=sad.png,Oh, I thought you were gonna use the ball for something else. Am I actually a pervert?
0-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;estelle:,id:71=smug.png,What wrong? The fancy lady can't sit on the floor? That's a nice looking chair too.
0-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;sola:=shocked.png,Wow, are you sure that's safe? In my experience, glowing lights always mean trouble. And if it's down there...
0-female_start_masturbating,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:183=serious.png,I don't get it. If you wanted to touch yourself so much, why go through all the trouble of playing this game?
0-female_start_masturbating,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:183=serious.png,Wouldn't it have been easier if you'd done this somewhere else instead of having to lose this game? Somewhere far away?
0-female_start_masturbating,filter:tandem=smiling.png,Hey, your friend is here. Are you two going to...? Oh, yeah. Okay...
0-female_start_masturbating,filter:tandem=thinking.png,Oh, I guess you needed backup. Not the kind of thing I'd want help with, but I'm not judging.
0-female_start_masturbating,filter:tandem=calm.png,Are you sure you're okay doing this with your friend? Oh, seems like you are.
0-female_start_masturbating,filter:villain,oneShotId:194=calm.png,I've met a lot of bad people in my life. After a while, it's hard to feel sorry for them.
0-female_start_masturbating,filter:villain,oneShotId:194=calm.png,If you want people to feel sorry for you, become a better person.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=shocked.png,I don't have a dirty mind, it's just too obvious...
0-female_start_masturbating,target:cammy_white=calm.png,Be strong. I'm sure you won't find it that hard after a while.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth,targetSayingMarker:nightmare=shocked.png,Two Elizabeths... This is a terrifying Devil Fruit ability.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:futaba=smiling.png,Go, little sis! Show us what you got.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:jolyne=thinking.png,Is there something I'm not seeing here?
0-female_start_masturbating,target:juri=sad.png,(It was obvious from the beginning, but now more than every: this woman is a complete pervert.)
0-female_start_masturbating,target:kizuna=calm.png,Okaaay... What are you waiting for exactly?
0-female_start_masturbating,target:miko=shocked.png,W-with the ghost? Sorry, I know she's your consort, but I can't help but find this creepy.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:misato=smug.png,Did you really get drunk drinking beer? We should have a drinking contest sometime, cause I'm sure I'll win.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:navi,id:43=shocked.png,I knew it! I hope you can take it, Navi.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,id:55=shocked.png,You're going to wrestle with each other? But that can't be all, right? According to the rules...
0-female_start_masturbating,target:raven=shocked.png,Oh no, she's finally gonna do something with her abilities... Should I run away?
0-female_start_masturbating,target:remilia=sad.png,You're drunk? Oh, good. Then you weren't drinking blood. Unless...
0-female_start_masturbating,target:rin=smiling.png,Oh, it's one of those toys. Even for something like this, it's good to be prepared.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:ryuko=smiling.png,Mako is gonna do this with you. That's sweet, and weird... but mostly sweet.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:sayaka,targetSayingMarker:soulgem,id:48=shocked.png,What are you gonna do with that gem? I love jewels too, but you might be going too far...
0-female_start_masturbating,target:shimakaze=sad.png,Can't you even lose without exploding?
0-female_start_masturbating,target:uravity=shocked.png,You can float even without your outfit? Then you are a Devil Fruit user.
0-female_start_masturbating,target:weiss_schnee=calm.png,I'm sorry. But if you'd been willing to pay me for real, I could've help you leave the game with your dignity intact.
0-female_start_masturbating,totalMasturbating:1,oneShotId:119=shocked.png,Are you really doing it? After sailing through the Grand Line you learn to doubt common sense, but man...
0-female_start_masturbating,totalMasturbating:1,oneShotId:119=sad.png,Why? What is this game...?
0-female_masturbating,filter:tandem=shocked.png,You're getting handled quite well, ~name~.
0-female_masturbating,filter:tandem=shocked.png,You really seem okay with letting her touch you like that.
0-female_masturbating,filter:tandem=smiling.png,Being close with someone to this level... It must be kind of nice.
0-female_masturbating,filter:tandem=embarrassed.png,To understand this, I'm trying to imagine what it would be like if Robin helped me. I mean, with her ability she could... I'll just shut up now.
0-female_masturbating,filter:tandem=thinking.png,I can tel you two have done this before. But how many times?
0-female_masturbating,filter:tandem=calm.png,You two are obviously way past the point it was awkward.
0-female_masturbating,saidMarker:target1,priority:0,test:~_.tag.human_male~:true=serious.png,Why are you looking at ~name~ like that, ~player~? You men are so predictable.
0-female_masturbating,saidMarker:target1,priority:0,test:~_.tag.human_male~:true=serious.png,Someone hand ~player~ a tissue. He's drooling after looking at ~name~.
0-female_masturbating,saidMarker:target1,priority:0,test:~_.tag.human_male~:true=serious.png,So you're one of those guys that drools over every cute girl, huh? ~Player~? I see you looking at ~name~.
0-female_finished_masturbating=shocked.png,It didn't take you that long to finish. Or maybe it just feels like that because I'm still fully dressed.
0-female_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika&sayingmarker;finished:=sad.png,I feel like I just got tricked into watching porn... Eh, I mean, good job you two.
0-female_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;sola:=sad.png,I'm not sure if that crystal is worth stealing now... Well, if it's <i>really</i> valuable...
0-female_finished_masturbating,priority:301,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&sayingmarker;pop:,id:70=shocked.png,The balloon popped... I guess I shouldn't be surprised, you were using it very intensely.
0-female_finished_masturbating,priority:302,count-role;target&character;estelle&saidmarker;finish&sayingmarker;book:,id:72=thinking.png,I enjoy reading too, but at a place like this? While naked? That's more than just a hobby.
0-female_finished_masturbating,filter:tandem=shocked.png,That was twice as intense.
0-female_finished_masturbating,filter:tandem=shocked.png,Both of you finished, right?
0-female_finished_masturbating,filter:tandem=shocked.png,The two of you? At the same time?
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia,targetSayingMarker:stunned=shocked.png,You're crazy! Did you hurt yourself?
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:cammy_white,targetSayingMarker:finished=smiling.png,The difference between how pleased you look now and how scared you were before you started is like night and day, Cammy.
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:caulifla,targetSayingMarker:finished,id:17=shocked.png,What the hell are you?!
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:chun-li,targetSayingMarker:finished,id:19=shocked.png,What was that at the end? That didn't seem too in character for you, Chun-Li.
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=smiling.png,That ability really scares me. But if this is how you use it, I don't think I should worry, heheh...
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:futaba,oneShotId:238=embarrassed.png,I think you looked a little like me there at the end. Maybe we really are related, heheh...
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:jolyne,oneShotId:225=embarrassed.png,That was strange... I know that every woman gets stimulated in a different way, but...
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:juri,targetSayingMarker:finished=shocked.png,That was insane... (And I thought I squirt a lot.)
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:miko,oneShotId:223=smiling.png,Well, I stand corrected. That was kinda sweet in the end. You two clearly care about each other.
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:misato,oneShotId:224=thinking.png,You didn't pass out in the middle of it. I guess you weren't <i>that</i> drunk.
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:raven,targetSayingMarker:post_orgasm=shocked.png,That was terrifying. I don't want anything to do with this dark stuff, whatever it its...
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:ryuko,targetSayingMarker:finished=smiling.png,Haha, she felt asleep. She really reminds me of my own friends.
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:shimakaze,targetSayingMarker:rencatch=smiling.png,Hey, the little robot is back. I'm not really into robots and stuff like that, but it's kinda cute.
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity,targetSayingMarker:plop=sad.png,Ouch. Is your butt okay?
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:weiss_schnee=annoyed.png,Hey, why are you putting your jacket back on? You should pay us for that. Yep.
0-female_finished_masturbating,target:zone-tan,oneShotId:239=shocked.png,What was that at the end? It was scary in more ways than one.

1-female_start_masturbating,totalMasturbating:1,oneShotId:119=shocked.png,Are you really doing it? After sailing through the Grand Line you learn to doubt common sense, but man...
1-female_start_masturbating,totalMasturbating:1,oneShotId:119=sad.png,Why? What is this game...?
1-female_masturbating,filter:tandem=shocked.png,You're getting handled quite well, ~name~.
1-female_masturbating,filter:tandem=shocked.png,You really seem okay with letting her touch you like that.
1-female_masturbating,filter:tandem=smiling.png,Being close with someone to this level... It must be kind of nice.
1-female_masturbating,filter:tandem=embarrassed.png,To understand this, I'm trying to imagine what it would be like if Robin helped me. I mean, with her ability she could... I'll just shut up now.
1-female_masturbating,filter:tandem=thinking.png,I can tel you two have done this before. But how many times?
1-female_masturbating,filter:tandem=calm.png,You two are obviously way past the point it was awkward.
1-female_masturbating,saidMarker:target1,priority:0,test:~_.tag.human_male~:true=serious.png,Why are you looking at ~name~ like that, ~player~? You men are so predictable.
1-female_masturbating,saidMarker:target1,priority:0,test:~_.tag.human_male~:true=serious.png,Someone hand ~player~ a tissue. He's drooling after looking at ~name~.
1-female_masturbating,saidMarker:target1,priority:0,test:~_.tag.human_male~:true=serious.png,So you're one of those guys that drools over every cute girl, huh? ~Player~? I see you looking at ~name~.
1-female_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika&sayingmarker;finished:=sad.png,I feel like I just got tricked into watching porn... Eh, I mean, good job you two.
1-female_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;sola:=sad.png,I'm not sure if that crystal is worth stealing now... Well, if it's <i>really</i> valuable...
1-female_finished_masturbating,priority:301,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&sayingmarker;pop:,id:70=shocked.png,The balloon popped... I guess I shouldn't be surprised, you were using it very intensely.
1-female_finished_masturbating,priority:302,count-role;target&character;estelle&saidmarker;finish&sayingmarker;book:,id:72=thinking.png,I enjoy reading too, but at a place like this? While naked? That's more than just a hobby.
1-female_finished_masturbating,filter:tandem=shocked.png,That was twice as intense.
1-female_finished_masturbating,filter:tandem=shocked.png,Both of you finished, right?
1-female_finished_masturbating,filter:tandem=shocked.png,The two of you? At the same time?
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia,targetSayingMarker:stunned=shocked.png,You're crazy! Did you hurt yourself?
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:cammy_white,targetSayingMarker:finished=smiling.png,The difference between how pleased you look now and how scared you were before you started is like night and day, Cammy.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:caulifla,targetSayingMarker:finished,id:17=shocked.png,What the hell are you?!
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:chun-li,targetSayingMarker:finished,id:19=shocked.png,What was that at the end? That didn't seem too in character for you, Chun-Li.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=smiling.png,That ability really scares me. But if this is how you use it, I don't think I should worry, heheh...
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:futaba,oneShotId:238=embarrassed.png,I think you looked a little like me there at the end. Maybe we really are related, heheh...
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:jolyne,oneShotId:225=embarrassed.png,That was strange... I know that every woman gets stimulated in a different way, but...
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:juri,targetSayingMarker:finished=shocked.png,That was insane... (And I thought I squirt a lot.)
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:miko,oneShotId:223=smiling.png,Well, I stand corrected. That was kinda sweet in the end. You two clearly care about each other.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:misato,oneShotId:224=thinking.png,You didn't pass out in the middle of it. I guess you weren't <i>that</i> drunk.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:raven,targetSayingMarker:post_orgasm=shocked.png,That was terrifying. I don't want anything to do with this dark stuff, whatever it its...
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:ryuko,targetSayingMarker:finished=smiling.png,Haha, she felt asleep. She really reminds me of my own friends.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:shimakaze,targetSayingMarker:rencatch=smiling.png,Hey, the little robot is back. I'm not really into robots and stuff like that, but it's kinda cute.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity,targetSayingMarker:plop=sad.png,Ouch. Is your butt okay?
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:weiss_schnee=annoyed.png,Hey, why are you putting your jacket back on? You should pay us for that. Yep.
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:zone-tan,oneShotId:239=shocked.png,What was that at the end? It was scary in more ways than one.


#lost bracelet
2-male_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;ryuji:=smiling.png,Too bad for you, Ryuji. I have nothing against you really.
2-male_must_masturbate,target:pit=smiling.png,Your move, Pit. And no flying away, mister! Just kidding, I know you can't fly with those wings.
2-male_must_masturbate,totalFinished:0,oneShotId:123=happy.png,And the first one is out! That wasn't so hard.
2-male_must_masturbate,totalFinished:0,oneShotId:123=smiling.png,Well played, ~name~. Now you can gather your clothes and leave.
2-male_must_masturbate,totalFinished:0,oneShotId:123=smiling.png,You gave it your best, didn't you? Then there's no reason to feel down. All you lost is that we saw you naked.
2-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;ryuji:=smug.png,But I gotta say... it's a little refreshing to see a man embarrassed in this position. At least that means you're not a huge pervert.
2-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;n:=happy.png,Oh, that sure is a nice looking chair. Too bad it's too big to take it with me.
2-male_start_masturbating,target:pit=sad.png,Sorry, I didn't mean to kick you when you're down.
2-male_start_masturbating,oneShotId:162,priority:1,test:~target.size~:large=thinking.png,Don't you need bigger hands to match the size of your... member? Or is this gonna be a challenge?
2-male_start_masturbating,oneShotId:162,priority:1,test:~target.size~:large=embarrassed.png,I doubt it can get any bigger, no matter how much you touch it.
2-male_start_masturbating,oneShotId:162,priority:1,test:~target.size~:large=smiling.png,So, is this the normal method? Or do you have to do it a different way because of how big it is?
2-male_start_masturbating,oneShotId:161,priority:1,test:~target.size~:small=thinking.png,Are you sure you won't have a problem with this? I mean, because of the small size of your...
2-male_start_masturbating,oneShotId:161,priority:1,test:~target.size~:small=embarrassed.png,Will it really become bigger after he touches it? Cause it was pretty small and... Oh, sorry. I was thinking out loud.
2-male_start_masturbating,totalFinished:1,oneShotId:124=shocked.png,Whoa, what are you doing?! Oh, right. I forgot about this part of the game.
2-male_start_masturbating,totalFinished:1,oneShotId:124=shocked.png,Hey, where are you touching...?! Oh, I forgot for a minute you now have to do <i>that</i>.
2-male_start_masturbating,totalFinished:1,oneShotId:124=shocked.png,Hey, do that outside! Oh, of course... I forgot that's part of the game. I just thought you were showing us your perverted side for no reason.
2-male_masturbating,target:human,saidMarker:target1,priority:0=annoyed.png,What are you doing, ~player~? How would you like it if I touched myself while looking at you? Ugh, bad example...
2-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;dust:=sad.png,Oh, you got that all over your fur.
2-male_finished_masturbating,target:kamina=shocked.png,Did you. uh... <i>finish</i> multiple times? I didn't know men could...
2-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;lotte:=shocked.png,A crystal ball? What do you need that for?
2-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;sola:,id:75=calm.png,Sola lost? Wait, that's that crystal for?
2-female_must_masturbate,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:182=thinking.png,Congratulations? You wanted to lose, didn't you?
2-female_must_masturbate,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:182=thinking.png,I guess you won whatever game you were playing.
2-female_must_masturbate,filter:villain,oneShotId:193=smug.png,Normally I would feel bad for a woman losing this game, but I don't think you deserve my sympathy, ~name~.
2-female_must_masturbate,filter:villain,oneShotId:193=smug.png,I'm not gonna make fun of you for losing, but I have no words of sympathy to offer you, ~name~.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=sad.png,What are you gonna use your ability for now? I'm scared...
2-female_must_masturbate,target:cammy_white=sad.png,Oh, hey... Don't cry, Cammy. I know we didn't get along at first, but you can do this.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=shocked.png,What is that portal?! Did you do it?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:futaba=embarrassed.png,You're younger than me, but you're still taking this a lot better than I would, Futaba.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:juri=serious.png,You don't look even the least bit worried that you lost.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=sad.png,Your turn, Misato. Wait, are you drunk?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:navi=sad.png,Eh... Those look like those weird seeds Usopp uses for fighting, the ones that sprout giant plants.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:nayru,targetSayingMarker:n_forfeit=shocked.png,G-go away, strange black thing! Leave Nayru alone!
2-female_must_masturbate,target:remilia=shocked.png,You lost? Eh... seeing you fly with those wings is so creepy. They're just like a bat's.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:rin=sad.png,Oh, you lost Rin. Ehm... how are you gonna do this?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:sayaka=smug.png,You should've paid more attention to the game instead of focusing on this hypothetical witch.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:shimakaze=shocked.png,SHIMAKAZE!
2-female_must_masturbate,target:weiss_schnee=annoyed.png,Oh, come on. Don't pretend like you've never done this just because you're rich and fancy.
2-female_must_masturbate,totalMasturbating:0,oneShotId:24=sad.png,You lost! Bye, ~name~... Oh, right. I forgot you have to... pay. But you're not gonna do it, are you?
2-female_must_masturbate,totalMasturbating:0,oneShotId:24=shocked.png,H-hey, are you really gonna do this? What if we just leave the game here? I don't care about the prize that much.
2-female_must_masturbate,totalMasturbating:0,oneShotId:24=shocked.png,Hey! You don't have to do this, ~name~. It's not worth it.
2-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie:,id:69=annoyed.png,A balloon? Are you seriously gonna use a balloon for...? Okay...
2-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;lotte:=sad.png,Oh, I thought you were gonna use the ball for something else. Am I actually a pervert?
2-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;estelle:,id:71=smug.png,What wrong? The fancy lady can't sit on the floor? That's a nice looking chair too.
2-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;sola:=shocked.png,Wow, are you sure that's safe? In my experience, glowing lights always mean trouble. And if it's down there...
2-female_start_masturbating,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:183=serious.png,I don't get it. If you wanted to touch yourself so much, why go through all the trouble of playing this game?
2-female_start_masturbating,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:183=serious.png,Wouldn't it have been easier if you'd done this somewhere else instead of having to lose this game? Somewhere far away?
2-female_start_masturbating,filter:tandem=smiling.png,Hey, your friend is here. Are you two going to...? Oh, yeah. Okay...
2-female_start_masturbating,filter:tandem=thinking.png,Oh, I guess you needed backup. Not the kind of thing I'd want help with, but I'm not judging.
2-female_start_masturbating,filter:tandem=calm.png,Are you sure you're okay doing this with your friend? Oh, seems like you are.
2-female_start_masturbating,filter:villain,oneShotId:194=calm.png,I've met a lot of bad people in my life. After a while, it's hard to feel sorry for them.
2-female_start_masturbating,filter:villain,oneShotId:194=calm.png,If you want people to feel sorry for you, become a better person.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=shocked.png,I don't have a dirty mind, it's just too obvious...
2-female_start_masturbating,target:cammy_white=calm.png,Be strong. I'm sure you won't find it that hard after a while.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth,targetSayingMarker:nightmare=shocked.png,Two Elizabeths... This is a terrifying Devil Fruit ability.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:futaba=smiling.png,Go, little sis! Show us what you got.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:jolyne=thinking.png,Is there something I'm not seeing here?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:juri=sad.png,(It was obvious from the beginning, but now more than every: this woman is a complete pervert.)
2-female_start_masturbating,target:kizuna=calm.png,Okaaay... What are you waiting for exactly?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:miko=shocked.png,W-with the ghost? Sorry, I know she's your consort, but I can't help but find this creepy.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:misato=smug.png,Did you really get drunk drinking beer? We should have a drinking contest sometime, cause I'm sure I'll win.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:navi,id:43=shocked.png,I knew it! I hope you can take it, Navi.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,id:55=shocked.png,You're going to wrestle with each other? But that can't be all, right? According to the rules...
2-female_start_masturbating,target:raven=shocked.png,Oh no, she's finally gonna do something with her abilities... Should I run away?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:remilia=sad.png,You're drunk? Oh, good. Then you weren't drinking blood. Unless...
2-female_start_masturbating,target:rin=smiling.png,Oh, it's one of those toys. Even for something like this, it's good to be prepared.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:ryuko=smiling.png,Mako is gonna do this with you. That's sweet, and weird... but mostly sweet.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:sayaka,targetSayingMarker:soulgem,id:48=shocked.png,What are you gonna do with that gem? I love jewels too, but you might be going too far...
2-female_start_masturbating,target:shimakaze=sad.png,Can't you even lose without exploding?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:uravity=shocked.png,You can float even without your outfit? Then you are a Devil Fruit user.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:weiss_schnee=calm.png,I'm sorry. But if you'd been willing to pay me for real, I could've help you leave the game with your dignity intact.
2-female_start_masturbating,totalMasturbating:1,oneShotId:119=shocked.png,Are you really doing it? After sailing through the Grand Line you learn to doubt common sense, but man...
2-female_start_masturbating,totalMasturbating:1,oneShotId:119=sad.png,Why? What is this game...?

3-female_must_masturbate,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:182=thinking.png,I guess you won whatever game you were playing.
3-female_must_masturbate,filter:villain,oneShotId:193=smug.png,Normally I would feel bad for a woman losing this game, but I don't think you deserve my sympathy, ~name~.
3-female_must_masturbate,filter:villain,oneShotId:193=smug.png,I'm not gonna make fun of you for losing, but I have no words of sympathy to offer you, ~name~.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=sad.png,What are you gonna use your ability for now? I'm scared...
3-female_must_masturbate,target:cammy_white=sad.png,Oh, hey... Don't cry, Cammy. I know we didn't get along at first, but you can do this.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=shocked.png,What is that portal?! Did you do it?
3-female_must_masturbate,target:futaba=embarrassed.png,You're younger than me, but you're still taking this a lot better than I would, Futaba.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:juri=serious.png,You don't look even the least bit worried that you lost.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=sad.png,Your turn, Misato. Wait, are you drunk?
3-female_must_masturbate,target:navi=sad.png,Eh... Those look like those weird seeds Usopp uses for fighting, the ones that sprout giant plants.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:nayru,targetSayingMarker:n_forfeit=shocked.png,G-go away, strange black thing! Leave Nayru alone!
3-female_must_masturbate,target:remilia=shocked.png,You lost? Eh... seeing you fly with those wings is so creepy. They're just like a bat's.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:rin=sad.png,Oh, you lost Rin. Ehm... how are you gonna do this?
3-female_must_masturbate,target:sayaka=smug.png,You should've paid more attention to the game instead of focusing on this hypothetical witch.
3-female_must_masturbate,target:shimakaze=shocked.png,SHIMAKAZE!
3-female_must_masturbate,target:weiss_schnee=annoyed.png,Oh, come on. Don't pretend like you've never done this just because you're rich and fancy.
3-female_must_masturbate,totalMasturbating:0,oneShotId:24=sad.png,You lost! Bye, ~name~... Oh, right. I forgot you have to... pay. But you're not gonna do it, are you?
3-female_must_masturbate,totalMasturbating:0,oneShotId:24=shocked.png,H-hey, are you really gonna do this? What if we just leave the game here? I don't care about the prize that much.
3-female_must_masturbate,totalMasturbating:0,oneShotId:24=shocked.png,Hey! You don't have to do this, ~name~. It's not worth it.
3-female_start_masturbating=serious.png,This game is sick. This is something girls should do in private.
3-female_start_masturbating=calm.png,Stay strong, sister. You have my support.
3-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie:,id:69=annoyed.png,A balloon? Are you seriously gonna use a balloon for...? Okay...
3-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;lotte:=sad.png,Oh, I thought you were gonna use the ball for something else. Am I actually a pervert?
3-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;estelle:,id:71=smug.png,What wrong? The fancy lady can't sit on the floor? That's a nice looking chair too.
3-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;sola:=shocked.png,Wow, are you sure that's safe? In my experience, glowing lights always mean trouble. And if it's down there...
3-female_start_masturbating,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:183=serious.png,I don't get it. If you wanted to touch yourself so much, why go through all the trouble of playing this game?
3-female_start_masturbating,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:183=serious.png,Wouldn't it have been easier if you'd done this somewhere else instead of having to lose this game? Somewhere far away?
3-female_start_masturbating,filter:tandem=smiling.png,Hey, your friend is here. Are you two going to...? Oh, yeah. Okay...
3-female_start_masturbating,filter:tandem=thinking.png,Oh, I guess you needed backup. Not the kind of thing I'd want help with, but I'm not judging.
3-female_start_masturbating,filter:tandem=calm.png,Are you sure you're okay doing this with your friend? Oh, seems like you are.
3-female_start_masturbating,filter:villain,oneShotId:194=calm.png,I've met a lot of bad people in my life. After a while, it's hard to feel sorry for them.
3-female_start_masturbating,filter:villain,oneShotId:194=calm.png,If you want people to feel sorry for you, become a better person.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=shocked.png,I don't have a dirty mind, it's just too obvious...
3-female_start_masturbating,target:cammy_white=calm.png,Be strong. I'm sure you won't find it that hard after a while.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth,targetSayingMarker:nightmare=shocked.png,Two Elizabeths... This is a terrifying Devil Fruit ability.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:futaba=smiling.png,Go, little sis! Show us what you got.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:jolyne=thinking.png,Is there something I'm not seeing here?
3-female_start_masturbating,target:juri=sad.png,(It was obvious from the beginning, but now more than every: this woman is a complete pervert.)
3-female_start_masturbating,target:kizuna=calm.png,Okaaay... What are you waiting for exactly?
3-female_start_masturbating,target:miko=shocked.png,W-with the ghost? Sorry, I know she's your consort, but I can't help but find this creepy.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:misato=smug.png,Did you really get drunk drinking beer? We should have a drinking contest sometime, cause I'm sure I'll win.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:navi,id:43=shocked.png,I knew it! I hope you can take it, Navi.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,id:55=shocked.png,You're going to wrestle with each other? But that can't be all, right? According to the rules...
3-female_start_masturbating,target:raven=shocked.png,Oh no, she's finally gonna do something with her abilities... Should I run away?
3-female_start_masturbating,target:remilia=sad.png,You're drunk? Oh, good. Then you weren't drinking blood. Unless...
3-female_start_masturbating,target:rin=smiling.png,Oh, it's one of those toys. Even for something like this, it's good to be prepared.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:ryuko=smiling.png,Mako is gonna do this with you. That's sweet, and weird... but mostly sweet.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:sayaka,targetSayingMarker:soulgem,id:48=shocked.png,What are you gonna do with that gem? I love jewels too, but you might be going too far...
3-female_start_masturbating,target:shimakaze=sad.png,Can't you even lose without exploding?
3-female_start_masturbating,target:uravity=shocked.png,You can float even without your outfit? Then you are a Devil Fruit user.
3-female_start_masturbating,target:weiss_schnee=calm.png,I'm sorry. But if you'd been willing to pay me for real, I could've help you leave the game with your dignity intact.
3-female_start_masturbating,totalMasturbating:1,oneShotId:119=shocked.png,Are you really doing it? After sailing through the Grand Line you learn to doubt common sense, but man...
3-female_start_masturbating,totalMasturbating:1,oneShotId:119=sad.png,Why? What is this game...?
3-female_masturbating=shocked.png,You forgot about the game very fast, didn't you?
3-female_masturbating=sad.png,And I thought I knew what to do with my fingers...
3-female_masturbating=calm.png,Oh, so now it's fun, ~name~? You're an interesting person.
3-female_masturbating=smug.png,I didn't think about it earlier, but if everyone's distracted looking at ~name~, I might have a better chance to win.
3-female_masturbating=serious.png,So this what people who play this game want to see us do? That's another reason for me not to lose.
3-female_masturbating=embarrassed.png,It must be even more embarrassing to do this in public, and not have any idea <i>how</i> to do it.
3-female_masturbating,filter:tandem=shocked.png,You're getting handled quite well, ~name~.
3-female_masturbating,filter:tandem=shocked.png,You really seem okay with letting her touch you like that.
3-female_masturbating,filter:tandem=smiling.png,Being close with someone to this level... It must be kind of nice.
3-female_masturbating,filter:tandem=embarrassed.png,To understand this, I'm trying to imagine what it would be like if Robin helped me. I mean, with her ability she could... I'll just shut up now.
3-female_masturbating,filter:tandem=thinking.png,I can tel you two have done this before. But how many times?
3-female_masturbating,filter:tandem=calm.png,You two are obviously way past the point it was awkward.
3-female_masturbating,saidMarker:target1,priority:0,test:~_.tag.human_male~:true=serious.png,Why are you looking at ~name~ like that, ~player~? You men are so predictable.
3-female_masturbating,saidMarker:target1,priority:0,test:~_.tag.human_male~:true=serious.png,Someone hand ~player~ a tissue. He's drooling after looking at ~name~.
3-female_masturbating,saidMarker:target1,priority:0,test:~_.tag.human_male~:true=serious.png,So you're one of those guys that drools over every cute girl, huh? ~Player~? I see you looking at ~name~.
3-female_heavy_masturbating=shocked.png,You look like you should catch your breath, ~name~.
3-female_heavy_masturbating=serious.png,Things are getting intense for ~name~.
3-female_heavy_masturbating=embarrassed.png,(Those sounds she's making. She's going to...)
3-female_finished_masturbating=smiling.png,O-okay, now you can finally rest, ~name~.
3-female_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika&sayingmarker;finished:=sad.png,I feel like I just got tricked into watching porn... Eh, I mean, good job you two.
3-female_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;sola:=sad.png,I'm not sure if that crystal is worth stealing now... Well, if it's <i>really</i> valuable...
3-female_finished_masturbating,priority:301,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&sayingmarker;pop:,id:70=shocked.png,The balloon popped... I guess I shouldn't be surprised, you were using it very intensely.
3-female_finished_masturbating,priority:302,count-role;target&character;estelle&saidmarker;finish&sayingmarker;book:,id:72=thinking.png,I enjoy reading too, but at a place like this? While naked? That's more than just a hobby.
3-female_finished_masturbating,filter:tandem=shocked.png,That was twice as intense.
3-female_finished_masturbating,filter:tandem=shocked.png,Both of you finished, right?
3-female_finished_masturbating,filter:tandem=shocked.png,The two of you? At the same time?
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia,targetSayingMarker:stunned=shocked.png,You're crazy! Did you hurt yourself?
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:cammy_white,targetSayingMarker:finished=smiling.png,The difference between how pleased you look now and how scared you were before you started is like night and day, Cammy.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:caulifla,targetSayingMarker:finished,id:17=shocked.png,What the hell are you?!
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:chun-li,targetSayingMarker:finished,id:19=shocked.png,What was that at the end? That didn't seem too in character for you, Chun-Li.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=smiling.png,That ability really scares me. But if this is how you use it, I don't think I should worry, heheh...
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:futaba,oneShotId:238=embarrassed.png,I think you looked a little like me there at the end. Maybe we really are related, heheh...
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:jolyne,oneShotId:225=embarrassed.png,That was strange... I know that every woman gets stimulated in a different way, but...
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:juri,targetSayingMarker:finished=shocked.png,That was insane... (And I thought I squirt a lot.)
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:miko,oneShotId:223=smiling.png,Well, I stand corrected. That was kinda sweet in the end. You two clearly care about each other.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:misato,oneShotId:224=thinking.png,You didn't pass out in the middle of it. I guess you weren't <i>that</i> drunk.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:raven,targetSayingMarker:post_orgasm=shocked.png,That was terrifying. I don't want anything to do with this dark stuff, whatever it its...
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:ryuko,targetSayingMarker:finished=smiling.png,Haha, she felt asleep. She really reminds me of my own friends.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:shimakaze,targetSayingMarker:rencatch=smiling.png,Hey, the little robot is back. I'm not really into robots and stuff like that, but it's kinda cute.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity,targetSayingMarker:plop=sad.png,Ouch. Is your butt okay?
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:weiss_schnee=annoyed.png,Hey, why are you putting your jacket back on? You should pay us for that. Yep.
3-female_finished_masturbating,target:zone-tan,oneShotId:239=shocked.png,What was that at the end? It was scary in more ways than one.

4-male_must_masturbate=greedy.png,Your defeat is not in vain, ~name~. You're helping me win the most important treasure of all... the prize money!
4-male_must_masturbate=happy.png,Yay! I'm gonna win! Maybe...
4-male_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;ryuji:=smiling.png,Too bad for you, Ryuji. I have nothing against you really.
4-male_must_masturbate,target:pit=smiling.png,Your move, Pit. And no flying away, mister! Just kidding, I know you can't fly with those wings.
4-male_must_masturbate,totalFinished:0,oneShotId:123=happy.png,And the first one is out! That wasn't so hard.
4-male_must_masturbate,totalFinished:0,oneShotId:123=smiling.png,Well played, ~name~. Now you can gather your clothes and leave.
4-male_must_masturbate,totalFinished:0,oneShotId:123=smiling.png,You gave it your best, didn't you? Then there's no reason to feel down. All you lost is that we saw you naked.
4-male_start_masturbating=serious.png,I know you're gonna have to do something very outrageous, but please take it seriously.
4-male_start_masturbating=calm.png,Nothing to do now but take it... like a man.
4-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;ryuji:=smug.png,But I gotta say... it's a little refreshing to see a man embarrassed in this position. At least that means you're not a huge pervert.
4-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;n:=happy.png,Oh, that sure is a nice looking chair. Too bad it's too big to take it with me.
4-male_start_masturbating,target:pit=sad.png,Sorry, I didn't mean to kick you when you're down.
4-male_start_masturbating,oneShotId:162,priority:1,test:~target.size~:large=thinking.png,Don't you need bigger hands to match the size of your... member? Or is this gonna be a challenge?
4-male_start_masturbating,oneShotId:162,priority:1,test:~target.size~:large=embarrassed.png,I doubt it can get any bigger, no matter how much you touch it.
4-male_start_masturbating,oneShotId:162,priority:1,test:~target.size~:large=smiling.png,So, is this the normal method? Or do you have to do it a different way because of how big it is?
4-male_start_masturbating,oneShotId:161,priority:1,test:~target.size~:small=thinking.png,Are you sure you won't have a problem with this? I mean, because of the small size of your...
4-male_start_masturbating,oneShotId:161,priority:1,test:~target.size~:small=embarrassed.png,Will it really become bigger after he touches it? Cause it was pretty small and... Oh, sorry. I was thinking out loud.
4-male_start_masturbating,totalFinished:1,oneShotId:124=shocked.png,Whoa, what are you doing?! Oh, right. I forgot about this part of the game.
4-male_start_masturbating,totalFinished:1,oneShotId:124=shocked.png,Hey, where are you touching...?! Oh, I forgot for a minute you now have to do <i>that</i>.
4-male_start_masturbating,totalFinished:1,oneShotId:124=shocked.png,Hey, do that outside! Oh, of course... I forgot that's part of the game. I just thought you were showing us your perverted side for no reason.
4-male_masturbating=furious.png,Don't do it too hard, ~name~! You're freaking me out!
4-male_masturbating=greedy.png,(Ignore him, Nami. Think about pleasant stuff, like treasure...)
4-male_masturbating=embarrassed.png,(I'm not gonna look at it directly. Well, maybe a little...)
4-male_masturbating=serious.png,Hey! No getting distracted, mister. Focus on what you're doing.
4-male_masturbating=sad.png,You don't have to push yourself too hard if you don't want to, ~name~...
4-male_masturbating,target:human,saidMarker:target1,priority:0=annoyed.png,What are you doing, ~player~? How would you like it if I touched myself while looking at you? Ugh, bad example...
4-male_finished_masturbating=shocked.png,Are you gonna clean that up...?
4-male_finished_masturbating=shocked.png,That reminded me of a knock-up stream...
4-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;dust:=sad.png,Oh, you got that all over your fur.
4-male_finished_masturbating,target:kamina=shocked.png,Did you. uh... <i>finish</i> multiple times? I didn't know men could...
4-female_must_masturbate=sad.png,What if we agreed on a different punishment for the loser? Like dumping a bucket of water on their heads, or something?
4-female_must_masturbate=serious.png,And as if it wasn't enough for the loser to be seen naked, now comes <i>this</i>.
4-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;lotte:=shocked.png,A crystal ball? What do you need that for?
4-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;sola:,id:75=calm.png,Sola lost? Wait, that's that crystal for?
4-female_must_masturbate,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:182=thinking.png,Congratulations? You wanted to lose, didn't you?
4-female_must_masturbate,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:182=thinking.png,I guess you won whatever game you were playing.
4-female_must_masturbate,filter:villain,oneShotId:193=smug.png,Normally I would feel bad for a woman losing this game, but I don't think you deserve my sympathy, ~name~.

4-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=sad.png,What are you gonna use your ability for now? I'm scared...
4-female_must_masturbate,target:cammy_white=sad.png,Oh, hey... Don't cry, Cammy. I know we didn't get along at first, but you can do this.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=shocked.png,What is that portal?! Did you do it?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:futaba=embarrassed.png,You're younger than me, but you're still taking this a lot better than I would, Futaba.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:juri=serious.png,You don't look even the least bit worried that you lost.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=sad.png,Your turn, Misato. Wait, are you drunk?
4-female_must_masturbate,target:navi=sad.png,Eh... Those look like those weird seeds Usopp uses for fighting, the ones that sprout giant plants.
4-female_must_masturbate,target:nayru,targetSayingMarker:n_forfeit=shocked.png,G-go away, strange black thing! Leave Nayru alone!
4-female_must_masturbate,target:remilia=shocked.png,You lost? Eh... seeing you fly with those wings is so creepy. They're just like a bat's.

4-female_must_masturbate,totalMasturbating:0,oneShotId:24=sad.png,You lost! Bye, ~name~... Oh, right. I forgot you have to... pay. But you're not gonna do it, are you?
4-female_must_masturbate,totalMasturbating:0,oneShotId:24=shocked.png,H-hey, are you really gonna do this? What if we just leave the game here? I don't care about the prize that much.
4-female_must_masturbate,totalMasturbating:0,oneShotId:24=shocked.png,Hey! You don't have to do this, ~name~. It's not worth it.
4-female_start_masturbating=greedy.png,This killed all interest I have in the prize. No, wait... it's back!
4-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie:,id:69=annoyed.png,A balloon? Are you seriously gonna use a balloon for...? Okay...

4-female_masturbating=shocked.png,You forgot about the game very fast, didn't you?
4-female_masturbating=sad.png,And I thought I knew what to do with my fingers...
4-female_masturbating=calm.png,Oh, so now it's fun, ~name~? You're an interesting person.
4-female_masturbating=smug.png,I didn't think about it earlier, but if everyone's distracted looking at ~name~, I might have a better chance to win.
4-female_masturbating=serious.png,So this what people who play this game want to see us do? That's another reason for me not to lose.
4-female_masturbating=embarrassed.png,It must be even more embarrassing to do this in public, and not have any idea <i>how</i> to do it.
4-female_masturbating,filter:tandem=shocked.png,You're getting handled quite well, ~name~.
4-female_masturbating,filter:tandem=shocked.png,You really seem okay with letting her touch you like that.
4-female_masturbating,filter:tandem=smiling.png,Being close with someone to this level... It must be kind of nice.
4-female_masturbating,filter:tandem=embarrassed.png,To understand this, I'm trying to imagine what it would be like if Robin helped me. I mean, with her ability she could... I'll just shut up now.
4-female_masturbating,filter:tandem=thinking.png,I can tel you two have done this before. But how many times?
4-female_masturbating,filter:tandem=calm.png,You two are obviously way past the point it was awkward.
4-female_masturbating,saidMarker:target1,priority:0,test:~_.tag.human_male~:true=serious.png,Why are you looking at ~name~ like that, ~player~? You men are so predictable.
4-female_masturbating,saidMarker:target1,priority:0,test:~_.tag.human_male~:true=serious.png,Someone hand ~player~ a tissue. He's drooling after looking at ~name~.
4-female_masturbating,saidMarker:target1,priority:0,test:~_.tag.human_male~:true=serious.png,So you're one of those guys that drools over every cute girl, huh? ~Player~? I see you looking at ~name~.
4-female_heavy_masturbating=shocked.png,You look like you should catch your breath, ~name~.
4-female_heavy_masturbating=serious.png,Things are getting intense for ~name~.
4-female_heavy_masturbating=embarrassed.png,(Those sounds she's making. She's going to...)
4-female_finished_masturbating=smiling.png,O-okay, now you can finally rest, ~name~.
4-female_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika&sayingmarker;finished:=sad.png,I feel like I just got tricked into watching porn... Eh, I mean, good job you two.
4-female_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;sola:=sad.png,I'm not sure if that crystal is worth stealing now... Well, if it's <i>really</i> valuable...
4-female_finished_masturbating,priority:301,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&sayingmarker;pop:,id:70=shocked.png,The balloon popped... I guess I shouldn't be surprised, you were using it very intensely.
4-female_finished_masturbating,priority:302,count-role;target&character;estelle&saidmarker;finish&sayingmarker;book:,id:72=thinking.png,I enjoy reading too, but at a place like this? While naked? That's more than just a hobby.
4-female_finished_masturbating,filter:tandem=shocked.png,That was twice as intense.
4-female_finished_masturbating,filter:tandem=shocked.png,Both of you finished, right?
4-female_finished_masturbating,filter:tandem=shocked.png,The two of you? At the same time?
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia,targetSayingMarker:stunned=shocked.png,You're crazy! Did you hurt yourself?
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:cammy_white,targetSayingMarker:finished=smiling.png,The difference between how pleased you look now and how scared you were before you started is like night and day, Cammy.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:caulifla,targetSayingMarker:finished,id:17=shocked.png,What the hell are you?!
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:chun-li,targetSayingMarker:finished,id:19=shocked.png,What was that at the end? That didn't seem too in character for you, Chun-Li.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=smiling.png,That ability really scares me. But if this is how you use it, I don't think I should worry, heheh...
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:futaba,oneShotId:238=embarrassed.png,I think you looked a little like me there at the end. Maybe we really are related, heheh...
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:jolyne,oneShotId:225=embarrassed.png,That was strange... I know that every woman gets stimulated in a different way, but...
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:juri,targetSayingMarker:finished=shocked.png,That was insane... (And I thought I squirt a lot.)
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:miko,oneShotId:223=smiling.png,Well, I stand corrected. That was kinda sweet in the end. You two clearly care about each other.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:misato,oneShotId:224=thinking.png,You didn't pass out in the middle of it. I guess you weren't <i>that</i> drunk.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:raven,targetSayingMarker:post_orgasm=shocked.png,That was terrifying. I don't want anything to do with this dark stuff, whatever it its...
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:ryuko,targetSayingMarker:finished=smiling.png,Haha, she felt asleep. She really reminds me of my own friends.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:shimakaze,targetSayingMarker:rencatch=smiling.png,Hey, the little robot is back. I'm not really into robots and stuff like that, but it's kinda cute.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity,targetSayingMarker:plop=sad.png,Ouch. Is your butt okay?
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:weiss_schnee=annoyed.png,Hey, why are you putting your jacket back on? You should pay us for that. Yep.
4-female_finished_masturbating,target:zone-tan,oneShotId:239=shocked.png,What was that at the end? It was scary in more ways than one.

5-male_must_masturbate=happy.png,Yes! That's another one out!
5-male_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;ryuji:=smiling.png,Too bad for you, Ryuji. I have nothing against you really.
5-male_must_masturbate,target:pit=smiling.png,Your move, Pit. And no flying away, mister! Just kidding, I know you can't fly with those wings.
5-male_must_masturbate,totalFinished:0,oneShotId:123=happy.png,And the first one is out! That wasn't so hard.
5-male_must_masturbate,totalFinished:0,oneShotId:123=smiling.png,Well played, ~name~. Now you can gather your clothes and leave.
5-male_must_masturbate,totalFinished:0,oneShotId:123=smiling.png,You gave it your best, didn't you? Then there's no reason to feel down. All you lost is that we saw you naked.
5-male_start_masturbating=seductive.png,As a thank you for losing when I need it the most, I'll let you look at my body for free. Just a little bit!
5-male_start_masturbating=furious.png,If you use my body for titillation, I'll smack you.
5-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;ryuji:=smug.png,But I gotta say... it's a little refreshing to see a man embarrassed in this position. At least that means you're not a huge pervert.
5-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;n:=happy.png,Oh, that sure is a nice looking chair. Too bad it's too big to take it with me.
5-male_start_masturbating,target:pit=sad.png,Sorry, I didn't mean to kick you when you're down.
5-male_start_masturbating,oneShotId:162,priority:1,test:~target.size~:large=thinking.png,Don't you need bigger hands to match the size of your... member? Or is this gonna be a challenge?
5-male_start_masturbating,oneShotId:162,priority:1,test:~target.size~:large=embarrassed.png,I doubt it can get any bigger, no matter how much you touch it.
5-male_start_masturbating,oneShotId:162,priority:1,test:~target.size~:large=smiling.png,So, is this the normal method? Or do you have to do it a different way because of how big it is?
5-male_start_masturbating,oneShotId:161,priority:1,test:~target.size~:small=thinking.png,Are you sure you won't have a problem with this? I mean, because of the small size of your...
5-male_start_masturbating,oneShotId:161,priority:1,test:~target.size~:small=embarrassed.png,Will it really become bigger after he touches it? Cause it was pretty small and... Oh, sorry. I was thinking out loud.
5-male_start_masturbating,totalFinished:1,oneShotId:124=shocked.png,Whoa, what are you doing?! Oh, right. I forgot about this part of the game.
5-male_start_masturbating,totalFinished:1,oneShotId:124=shocked.png,Hey, where are you touching...?! Oh, I forgot for a minute you now have to do <i>that</i>.
5-male_start_masturbating,totalFinished:1,oneShotId:124=shocked.png,Hey, do that outside! Oh, of course... I forgot that's part of the game. I just thought you were showing us your perverted side for no reason.
5-male_masturbating=furious.png,Why are you looking at me like that? I'll report you for sexual harassment!
5-male_masturbating=embarrassed.png,I'd have been more comfortable with you doing this in front of me when I had more clothes on. Maybe not...
5-male_masturbating=serious.png,H-hey! Where are you looking? Cut it out!
5-male_masturbating=embarrassed.png,...Me? I wasn't staring!
5-male_masturbating=thinking.png,I've kicked a man <i>there</i> more than once, and it seems like it really hurts. But I'm not sure why. It doesn't look that fragile to me now.
5-male_masturbating,target:human,saidMarker:target1,priority:0=annoyed.png,What are you doing, ~player~? How would you like it if I touched myself while looking at you? Ugh, bad example...
5-male_finished_masturbating=shocked.png,Uhhh... I think men make an even bigger mess than women.
5-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;dust:=sad.png,Oh, you got that all over your fur.
5-male_finished_masturbating,target:kamina=shocked.png,Did you. uh... <i>finish</i> multiple times? I didn't know men could...
5-female_must_masturbate=happy.png,Alright! Sorry, ~name~. At this point, I can't afford giving you any sympathy.
5-female_must_masturbate=calm.png,At this point, I'm equally happy and sad that you lost, ~name~. Well, more like 70% happy, 30% sad.
5-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;lotte:=shocked.png,A crystal ball? What do you need that for?
5-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;sola:,id:75=calm.png,Sola lost? Wait, that's that crystal for?
5-female_must_masturbate,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:182=thinking.png,Congratulations? You wanted to lose, didn't you?
5-female_must_masturbate,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:182=thinking.png,I guess you won whatever game you were playing.
5-female_must_masturbate,filter:villain,oneShotId:193=smug.png,Normally I would feel bad for a woman losing this game, but I don't think you deserve my sympathy, ~name~.
5-female_must_masturbate,filter:villain,oneShotId:193=smug.png,I'm not gonna make fun of you for losing, but I have no words of sympathy to offer you, ~name~.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=sad.png,What are you gonna use your ability for now? I'm scared...
5-female_must_masturbate,target:cammy_white=sad.png,Oh, hey... Don't cry, Cammy. I know we didn't get along at first, but you can do this.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=shocked.png,What is that portal?! Did you do it?
5-female_must_masturbate,target:futaba=embarrassed.png,You're younger than me, but you're still taking this a lot better than I would, Futaba.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:juri=serious.png,You don't look even the least bit worried that you lost.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=sad.png,Your turn, Misato. Wait, are you drunk?
5-female_must_masturbate,target:navi=sad.png,Eh... Those look like those weird seeds Usopp uses for fighting, the ones that sprout giant plants.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:nayru,targetSayingMarker:n_forfeit=shocked.png,G-go away, strange black thing! Leave Nayru alone!
5-female_must_masturbate,target:remilia=shocked.png,You lost? Eh... seeing you fly with those wings is so creepy. They're just like a bat's.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:rin=sad.png,Oh, you lost Rin. Ehm... how are you gonna do this?
5-female_must_masturbate,target:sayaka=smug.png,You should've paid more attention to the game instead of focusing on this hypothetical witch.
5-female_must_masturbate,target:shimakaze=shocked.png,SHIMAKAZE!
5-female_must_masturbate,target:weiss_schnee=annoyed.png,Oh, come on. Don't pretend like you've never done this just because you're rich and fancy.
5-female_must_masturbate,totalMasturbating:0,oneShotId:24=sad.png,You lost! Bye, ~name~... Oh, right. I forgot you have to... pay. But you're not gonna do it, are you?
5-female_must_masturbate,totalMasturbating:0,oneShotId:24=shocked.png,H-hey, are you really gonna do this? What if we just leave the game here? I don't care about the prize that much.
5-female_must_masturbate,totalMasturbating:0,oneShotId:24=shocked.png,Hey! You don't have to do this, ~name~. It's not worth it.
5-female_start_masturbating=sad.png,But this still sucks for you...
5-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie:,id:69=annoyed.png,A balloon? Are you seriously gonna use a balloon for...? Okay...
5-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;lotte:=sad.png,Oh, I thought you were gonna use the ball for something else. Am I actually a pervert?
5-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;estelle:,id:71=smug.png,What wrong? The fancy lady can't sit on the floor? That's a nice looking chair too.
5-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;sola:=shocked.png,Wow, are you sure that's safe? In my experience, glowing lights always mean trouble. And if it's down there...
5-female_start_masturbating,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:183=serious.png,I don't get it. If you wanted to touch yourself so much, why go through all the trouble of playing this game?
5-female_start_masturbating,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:183=serious.png,Wouldn't it have been easier if you'd done this somewhere else instead of having to lose this game? Somewhere far away?
5-female_start_masturbating,filter:tandem=smiling.png,Hey, your friend is here. Are you two going to...? Oh, yeah. Okay...
5-female_start_masturbating,filter:tandem=thinking.png,Oh, I guess you needed backup. Not the kind of thing I'd want help with, but I'm not judging.
5-female_start_masturbating,filter:tandem=calm.png,Are you sure you're okay doing this with your friend? Oh, seems like you are.
5-female_start_masturbating,filter:villain,oneShotId:194=calm.png,I've met a lot of bad people in my life. After a while, it's hard to feel sorry for them.
5-female_start_masturbating,filter:villain,oneShotId:194=calm.png,If you want people to feel sorry for you, become a better person.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=shocked.png,I don't have a dirty mind, it's just too obvious...
5-female_start_masturbating,target:cammy_white=calm.png,Be strong. I'm sure you won't find it that hard after a while.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth,targetSayingMarker:nightmare=shocked.png,Two Elizabeths... This is a terrifying Devil Fruit ability.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:futaba=smiling.png,Go, little sis! Show us what you got.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:jolyne=thinking.png,Is there something I'm not seeing here?
5-female_start_masturbating,target:juri=sad.png,(It was obvious from the beginning, but now more than every: this woman is a complete pervert.)
5-female_start_masturbating,target:kizuna=calm.png,Okaaay... What are you waiting for exactly?
5-female_start_masturbating,target:miko=shocked.png,W-with the ghost? Sorry, I know she's your consort, but I can't help but find this creepy.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:misato=smug.png,Did you really get drunk drinking beer? We should have a drinking contest sometime, cause I'm sure I'll win.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:navi,id:43=shocked.png,I knew it! I hope you can take it, Navi.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,id:55=shocked.png,You're going to wrestle with each other? But that can't be all, right? According to the rules...
5-female_start_masturbating,target:raven=shocked.png,Oh no, she's finally gonna do something with her abilities... Should I run away?
5-female_start_masturbating,target:remilia=sad.png,You're drunk? Oh, good. Then you weren't drinking blood. Unless...
5-female_start_masturbating,target:rin=smiling.png,Oh, it's one of those toys. Even for something like this, it's good to be prepared.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:ryuko=smiling.png,Mako is gonna do this with you. That's sweet, and weird... but mostly sweet.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:sayaka,targetSayingMarker:soulgem,id:48=shocked.png,What are you gonna do with that gem? I love jewels too, but you might be going too far...
5-female_start_masturbating,target:shimakaze=sad.png,Can't you even lose without exploding?
5-female_start_masturbating,target:uravity=shocked.png,You can float even without your outfit? Then you are a Devil Fruit user.
5-female_start_masturbating,target:weiss_schnee=calm.png,I'm sorry. But if you'd been willing to pay me for real, I could've help you leave the game with your dignity intact.
5-female_start_masturbating,totalMasturbating:1,oneShotId:119=shocked.png,Are you really doing it? After sailing through the Grand Line you learn to doubt common sense, but man...
5-female_start_masturbating,totalMasturbating:1,oneShotId:119=sad.png,Why? What is this game...?
5-female_masturbating=smiling.png,Looking at ~name~, maybe this isn't so bad after all. Not that I want to do it!
5-female_masturbating=embarrassed.png,Just look at ~name~. I'm embarrassed for her.
5-female_masturbating=annoyed.png,What have I gotten myself into? I'm so close to having to do it too.
5-female_masturbating=shocked.png,I <i>really</i> don't wanna lose. Or I'll be next...
5-female_masturbating=serious.png,Whenever I think about just giving up, I should look at ~name~ to remind myself that I can't lose.
5-female_masturbating=sad.png,Now that I look at ~name~, sorry if I mocked you for losing earlier. This is a tough forfeit.
5-female_masturbating,filter:tandem=shocked.png,You're getting handled quite well, ~name~.
5-female_masturbating,filter:tandem=shocked.png,You really seem okay with letting her touch you like that.

5-female_heavy_masturbating=shocked.png,Are you gonna finish? You are, aren't you?
5-female_heavy_masturbating=embarrassed.png,You're enjoying this a little too much in my opinion, ~name~.
5-female_heavy_masturbating=serious.png,R-really? You're gonna finish in front of all of us?
5-female_finished_masturbating=sad.png,Are we allowed to put our clothes back on when we, uh... finish? No? That sucks.

-3-male_start_masturbating,oneShotId:162,priority:1,test:~target.size~:large=thinking.png,Don't you need bigger hands to match the size of your... member? Or is this gonna be a challenge?
-3-male_start_masturbating,oneShotId:162,priority:1,test:~target.size~:large=embarrassed.png,I doubt it can get any bigger, no matter how much you touch it.
-3-male_start_masturbating,oneShotId:162,priority:1,test:~target.size~:large=smiling.png,So, is this the normal method? Or do you have to do it a different way because of how big it is?
-3-male_start_masturbating,oneShotId:161,priority:1,test:~target.size~:small=thinking.png,Are you sure you won't have a problem with this? I mean, because of the small size of your...
-3-male_start_masturbating,oneShotId:161,priority:1,test:~target.size~:small=embarrassed.png,Will it really become bigger after he touches it? Cause it was pretty small and... Oh, sorry. I was thinking out loud.
-3-male_start_masturbating,totalFinished:1,oneShotId:124=shocked.png,Whoa, what are you doing?! Oh, right. I forgot about this part of the game.
-3-male_start_masturbating,totalFinished:1,oneShotId:124=shocked.png,Hey, where are you touching...?! Oh, I forgot for a minute you now have to do <i>that</i>.
-3-male_start_masturbating,totalFinished:1,oneShotId:124=shocked.png,Hey, do that outside! Oh, of course... I forgot that's part of the game. I just thought you were showing us your perverted side for no reason.
-3-male_masturbating=furious.png,Why are you looking at me like that? I'll report you for sexual harassment!
-3-male_masturbating=embarrassed.png,I'd have been more comfortable with you doing this in front of me when I had more clothes on. Maybe not...
-3-male_masturbating=serious.png,H-hey! Where are you looking? Cut it out!
-3-male_masturbating=embarrassed.png,...Me? I wasn't staring!
-3-male_masturbating=thinking.png,I've kicked a man <i>there</i> more than once, and it seems like it really hurts. But I'm not sure why. It doesn't look that fragile to me now.
-3-male_masturbating,target:human,saidMarker:target1,priority:0=annoyed.png,What are you doing, ~player~? How would you like it if I touched myself while looking at you? Ugh, bad example...
-3-male_finished_masturbating=shocked.png,Uhhh... I think men make an even bigger mess than women.
-3-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;dust:=sad.png,Oh, you got that all over your fur.
-3-male_finished_masturbating,target:kamina=shocked.png,Did you. uh... <i>finish</i> multiple times? I didn't know men could...
-3-female_must_masturbate=happy.png,Alright! Sorry, ~name~. At this point, I can't afford giving you any sympathy.
-3-female_must_masturbate=calm.png,At this point, I'm equally happy and sad that you lost, ~name~. Well, more like 70% happy, 30% sad.
-3-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;lotte:=shocked.png,A crystal ball? What do you need that for?
-3-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;sola:,id:75=calm.png,Sola lost? Wait, that's that crystal for?
-3-female_must_masturbate,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:182=thinking.png,Congratulations? You wanted to lose, didn't you?
-3-female_must_masturbate,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:182=thinking.png,I guess you won whatever game you were playing.
-3-female_must_masturbate,filter:villain,oneShotId:193=smug.png,Normally I would feel bad for a woman losing this game, but I don't think you deserve my sympathy, ~name~.
-3-female_must_masturbate,filter:villain,oneShotId:193=smug.png,I'm not gonna make fun of you for losing, but I have no words of sympathy to offer you, ~name~.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=sad.png,What are you gonna use your ability for now? I'm scared...
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:cammy_white=sad.png,Oh, hey... Don't cry, Cammy. I know we didn't get along at first, but you can do this.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=shocked.png,What is that portal?! Did you do it?
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:futaba=embarrassed.png,You're younger than me, but you're still taking this a lot better than I would, Futaba.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:juri=serious.png,You don't look even the least bit worried that you lost.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=sad.png,Your turn, Misato. Wait, are you drunk?
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:navi=sad.png,Eh... Those look like those weird seeds Usopp uses for fighting, the ones that sprout giant plants.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:nayru,targetSayingMarker:n_forfeit=shocked.png,G-go away, strange black thing! Leave Nayru alone!
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:remilia=shocked.png,You lost? Eh... seeing you fly with those wings is so creepy. They're just like a bat's.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:rin=sad.png,Oh, you lost Rin. Ehm... how are you gonna do this?
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:sayaka=smug.png,You should've paid more attention to the game instead of focusing on this hypothetical witch.
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:shimakaze=shocked.png,SHIMAKAZE!
-3-female_must_masturbate,target:weiss_schnee=annoyed.png,Oh, come on. Don't pretend like you've never done this just because you're rich and fancy.
-3-female_must_masturbate,totalMasturbating:0,oneShotId:24=sad.png,You lost! Bye, ~name~... Oh, right. I forgot you have to... pay. But you're not gonna do it, are you?
-3-female_must_masturbate,totalMasturbating:0,oneShotId:24=shocked.png,H-hey, are you really gonna do this? What if we just leave the game here? I don't care about the prize that much.
-3-female_must_masturbate,totalMasturbating:0,oneShotId:24=shocked.png,Hey! You don't have to do this, ~name~. It's not worth it.
-3-female_start_masturbating=sad.png,But this still sucks for you...
-3-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie:,id:69=annoyed.png,A balloon? Are you seriously gonna use a balloon for...? Okay...
-3-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;lotte:=sad.png,Oh, I thought you were gonna use the ball for something else. Am I actually a pervert?
-3-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;estelle:,id:71=smug.png,What wrong? The fancy lady can't sit on the floor? That's a nice looking chair too.
-3-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;sola:=shocked.png,Wow, are you sure that's safe? In my experience, glowing lights always mean trouble. And if it's down there...
-3-female_start_masturbating,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:183=serious.png,I don't get it. If you wanted to touch yourself so much, why go through all the trouble of playing this game?
-3-female_start_masturbating,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:183=serious.png,Wouldn't it have been easier if you'd done this somewhere else instead of having to lose this game? Somewhere far away?
-3-female_start_masturbating,filter:tandem=smiling.png,Hey, your friend is here. Are you two going to...? Oh, yeah. Okay...
-3-female_start_masturbating,filter:tandem=thinking.png,Oh, I guess you needed backup. Not the kind of thing I'd want help with, but I'm not judging.
-3-female_start_masturbating,filter:tandem=calm.png,Are you sure you're okay doing this with your friend? Oh, seems like you are.
-3-female_start_masturbating,filter:villain,oneShotId:194=calm.png,I've met a lot of bad people in my life. After a while, it's hard to feel sorry for them.
-3-female_start_masturbating,filter:villain,oneShotId:194=calm.png,If you want people to feel sorry for you, become a better person.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=shocked.png,I don't have a dirty mind, it's just too obvious...
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:cammy_white=calm.png,Be strong. I'm sure you won't find it that hard after a while.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth,targetSayingMarker:nightmare=shocked.png,Two Elizabeths... This is a terrifying Devil Fruit ability.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:futaba=smiling.png,Go, little sis! Show us what you got.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:jolyne=thinking.png,Is there something I'm not seeing here?
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:juri=sad.png,(It was obvious from the beginning, but now more than every: this woman is a complete pervert.)
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:kizuna=calm.png,Okaaay... What are you waiting for exactly?
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:miko=shocked.png,W-with the ghost? Sorry, I know she's your consort, but I can't help but find this creepy.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:misato=smug.png,Did you really get drunk drinking beer? We should have a drinking contest sometime, cause I'm sure I'll win.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:navi,id:43=shocked.png,I knew it! I hope you can take it, Navi.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:rainbow_mika,id:55=shocked.png,You're going to wrestle with each other? But that can't be all, right? According to the rules...
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:raven=shocked.png,Oh no, she's finally gonna do something with her abilities... Should I run away?
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:remilia=sad.png,You're drunk? Oh, good. Then you weren't drinking blood. Unless...
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:rin=smiling.png,Oh, it's one of those toys. Even for something like this, it's good to be prepared.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:ryuko=smiling.png,Mako is gonna do this with you. That's sweet, and weird... but mostly sweet.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:sayaka,targetSayingMarker:soulgem,id:48=shocked.png,What are you gonna do with that gem? I love jewels too, but you might be going too far...
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:shimakaze=sad.png,Can't you even lose without exploding?
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:uravity=shocked.png,You can float even without your outfit? Then you are a Devil Fruit user.
-3-female_start_masturbating,target:weiss_schnee=calm.png,I'm sorry. But if you'd been willing to pay me for real, I could've help you leave the game with your dignity intact.
-3-female_start_masturbating,totalMasturbating:1,oneShotId:119=shocked.png,Are you really doing it? After sailing through the Grand Line you learn to doubt common sense, but man...
-3-female_start_masturbating,totalMasturbating:1,oneShotId:119=sad.png,Why? What is this game...?
-3-female_masturbating=smiling.png,Looking at ~name~, maybe this isn't so bad after all. Not that I want to do it!
-3-female_masturbating=embarrassed.png,Just look at ~name~. I'm embarrassed for her.
-3-female_masturbating=annoyed.png,What have I gotten myself into? I'm so close to having to do it too.
-3-female_masturbating=shocked.png,I <i>really</i> don't wanna lose. Or I'll be next...
-3-female_masturbating=serious.png,Whenever I think about just giving up, I should look at ~name~ to remind myself that I can't lose.
-3-female_masturbating=sad.png,Now that I look at ~name~, sorry if I mocked you for losing earlier. This is a tough forfeit.
-3-female_masturbating,filter:tandem=shocked.png,You're getting handled quite well, ~name~.
-3-female_masturbating,filter:tandem=shocked.png,You really seem okay with letting her touch you like that.
-3-female_masturbating,filter:tandem=smiling.png,Being close with someone to this level... It must be kind of nice.
-3-female_masturbating,filter:tandem=embarrassed.png,To understand this, I'm trying to imagine what it would be like if Robin helped me. I mean, with her ability she could... I'll just shut up now.
-3-female_masturbating,filter:tandem=thinking.png,I can tel you two have done this before. But how many times?
-3-female_masturbating,filter:tandem=calm.png,You two are obviously way past the point it was awkward.
-3-female_masturbating,saidMarker:target1,priority:0,test:~_.tag.human_male~:true=serious.png,Why are you looking at ~name~ like that, ~player~? You men are so predictable.
-3-female_masturbating,saidMarker:target1,priority:0,test:~_.tag.human_male~:true=serious.png,Someone hand ~player~ a tissue. He's drooling after looking at ~name~.
-3-female_masturbating,saidMarker:target1,priority:0,test:~_.tag.human_male~:true=serious.png,So you're one of those guys that drools over every cute girl, huh? ~Player~? I see you looking at ~name~.
-3-female_heavy_masturbating=shocked.png,Are you gonna finish? You are, aren't you?
-3-female_heavy_masturbating=embarrassed.png,You're enjoying this a little too much in my opinion, ~name~.
-3-female_heavy_masturbating=serious.png,R-really? You're gonna finish in front of all of us?
-3-female_finished_masturbating=sad.png,Are we allowed to put our clothes back on when we, uh... finish? No? That sucks.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;rainbow_mika&sayingmarker;finished:=sad.png,I feel like I just got tricked into watching porn... Eh, I mean, good job you two.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;sola:=sad.png,I'm not sure if that crystal is worth stealing now... Well, if it's <i>really</i> valuable...
-3-female_finished_masturbating,priority:301,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie&sayingmarker;pop:,id:70=shocked.png,The balloon popped... I guess I shouldn't be surprised, you were using it very intensely.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,priority:302,count-role;target&character;estelle&saidmarker;finish&sayingmarker;book:,id:72=thinking.png,I enjoy reading too, but at a place like this? While naked? That's more than just a hobby.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,filter:tandem=shocked.png,That was twice as intense.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,filter:tandem=shocked.png,Both of you finished, right?
-3-female_finished_masturbating,filter:tandem=shocked.png,The two of you? At the same time?
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:amalia,targetSayingMarker:stunned=shocked.png,You're crazy! Did you hurt yourself?
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:cammy_white,targetSayingMarker:finished=smiling.png,The difference between how pleased you look now and how scared you were before you started is like night and day, Cammy.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:caulifla,targetSayingMarker:finished,id:17=shocked.png,What the hell are you?!
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:chun-li,targetSayingMarker:finished,id:19=shocked.png,What was that at the end? That didn't seem too in character for you, Chun-Li.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=smiling.png,That ability really scares me. But if this is how you use it, I don't think I should worry, heheh...
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:futaba,oneShotId:238=embarrassed.png,I think you looked a little like me there at the end. Maybe we really are related, heheh...
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:jolyne,oneShotId:225=embarrassed.png,That was strange... I know that every woman gets stimulated in a different way, but...
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:juri,targetSayingMarker:finished=shocked.png,That was insane... (And I thought I squirt a lot.)
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:miko,oneShotId:223=smiling.png,Well, I stand corrected. That was kinda sweet in the end. You two clearly care about each other.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:misato,oneShotId:224=thinking.png,You didn't pass out in the middle of it. I guess you weren't <i>that</i> drunk.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:raven,targetSayingMarker:post_orgasm=shocked.png,That was terrifying. I don't want anything to do with this dark stuff, whatever it its...
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:ryuko,targetSayingMarker:finished=smiling.png,Haha, she felt asleep. She really reminds me of my own friends.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:shimakaze,targetSayingMarker:rencatch=smiling.png,Hey, the little robot is back. I'm not really into robots and stuff like that, but it's kinda cute.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:uravity,targetSayingMarker:plop=sad.png,Ouch. Is your butt okay?
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:weiss_schnee=annoyed.png,Hey, why are you putting your jacket back on? You should pay us for that. Yep.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:zone-tan,oneShotId:239=shocked.png,What was that at the end? It was scary in more ways than one.

-2-female_finished_masturbating,filter:tandem=shocked.png,That was twice as intense.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,filter:tandem=shocked.png,Both of you finished, right?

-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:chun-li,targetSayingMarker:finished,id:19=shocked.png,What was that at the end? That didn't seem too in character for you, Chun-Li.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:elizabeth=smiling.png,That ability really scares me. But if this is how you use it, I don't think I should worry, heheh...
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:futaba,oneShotId:238=embarrassed.png,I think you looked a little like me there at the end. Maybe we really are related, heheh...
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:jolyne,oneShotId:225=embarrassed.png,That was strange... I know that every woman gets stimulated in a different way, but...
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:juri,targetSayingMarker:finished=shocked.png,That was insane... (And I thought I squirt a lot.)
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:miko,oneShotId:223=smiling.png,Well, I stand corrected. That was kinda sweet in the end. You two clearly care about each other.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:misato,oneShotId:224=thinking.png,You didn't pass out in the middle of it. I guess you weren't <i>that</i> drunk.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:raven,targetSayingMarker:post_orgasm=shocked.png,That was terrifying. I don't want anything to do with this dark stuff, whatever it its...
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:ryuko,targetSayingMarker:finished=smiling.png,Haha, she felt asleep. She really reminds me of my own friends.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:shimakaze,targetSayingMarker:rencatch=smiling.png,Hey, the little robot is back. I'm not really into robots and stuff like that, but it's kinda cute.

-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:zone-tan,oneShotId:239=shocked.png,What was that at the end? It was scary in more ways than one.


#finished
-1-male_must_masturbate=happy.png,Ha! Look who's out of the game now, after beating poor old me.
-1-male_must_masturbate=smug.png,Ohhh... Boy, am I pleased to see you lose after giving me so much trouble when we were playing.
-1-male_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;ryuji:=smiling.png,Too bad for you, Ryuji. I have nothing against you really.
-1-male_must_masturbate,target:pit=smiling.png,Your move, Pit. And no flying away, mister! Just kidding, I know you can't fly with those wings.
-1-male_start_masturbating=smiling.png,I can't wait to see you touch yourself. I'm being sarcastic, by the way... kinda.
-1-male_start_masturbating=embarrassed.png,Now, I don't care much about you masturbating. B-but you have to do it! It's the rules.
-1-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;ryuji:=smug.png,But I gotta say... it's a little refreshing to see a man embarrassed in this position. At least that means you're not a huge pervert.
-1-male_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;n:=happy.png,Oh, that sure is a nice looking chair. Too bad it's too big to take it with me.
-1-male_start_masturbating,target:pit=sad.png,Sorry, I didn't mean to kick you when you're down.
-1-male_start_masturbating,oneShotId:162,priority:1,test:~target.size~:large=thinking.png,Don't you need bigger hands to match the size of your... member? Or is this gonna be a challenge?
-1-male_start_masturbating,oneShotId:162,priority:1,test:~target.size~:large=embarrassed.png,I doubt it can get any bigger, no matter how much you touch it.
-1-male_start_masturbating,oneShotId:162,priority:1,test:~target.size~:large=smiling.png,So, is this the normal method? Or do you have to do it a different way because of how big it is?
-1-male_start_masturbating,oneShotId:161,priority:1,test:~target.size~:small=thinking.png,Are you sure you won't have a problem with this? I mean, because of the small size of your...
-1-male_start_masturbating,oneShotId:161,priority:1,test:~target.size~:small=embarrassed.png,Will it really become bigger after he touches it? Cause it was pretty small and... Oh, sorry. I was thinking out loud.
-1-male_masturbating=embarrassed.png,A little slower, ~name~. Please...
-1-male_masturbating=seductive.png,Anything catching your attention, ~name~? I just thought I would help you a little.
-1-male_masturbating=embarrassed.png,I'm always so busy on adventure that maybe I haven't had much chance to look at men... that way.
-1-male_masturbating=seductive.png,Is this my reward for being so good?
-1-male_masturbating=happy.png,You still seem full of spirit, ~name~. That's good!
-1-male_masturbating=thinking.png,Does it feel as hard to the touch as it looks? Hmm... Am I thinking out loud again?
-1-male_masturbating=shocked.png,Suddenly I feel very conscious that I'm fully naked.
-1-male_masturbating=smiling.png,You've been containing yourself the whole game, ~name~. There's no doubt about it.
-1-male_finished_masturbating=embarrassed.png,I'd help you clean, but... I want to see you do it.
-1-male_finished_masturbating=embarrassed.png,Look at you all dirty. Should I use my Shower Tempo on you?
-1-male_finished_masturbating,count-role;target&character;dust:=sad.png,Oh, you got that all over your fur.
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:kamina=shocked.png,Did you. uh... <i>finish</i> multiple times? I didn't know men could...
-1-female_must_masturbate=calm.png,Oh, you're out. I was rooting for you at the end, ~name~.
-1-female_must_masturbate=sad.png,How sad you lost, ~name~. At least you lasted way longer than me.
-1-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;lotte:=shocked.png,A crystal ball? What do you need that for?
-1-female_must_masturbate,count-role;target&character;sola:,id:75=calm.png,Sola lost? Wait, that's that crystal for?
-1-female_must_masturbate,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:182=thinking.png,Congratulations? You wanted to lose, didn't you?
-1-female_must_masturbate,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:182=thinking.png,I guess you won whatever game you were playing.
-1-female_must_masturbate,filter:villain,oneShotId:193=smug.png,Normally I would feel bad for a woman losing this game, but I don't think you deserve my sympathy, ~name~.
-1-female_must_masturbate,filter:villain,oneShotId:193=smug.png,I'm not gonna make fun of you for losing, but I have no words of sympathy to offer you, ~name~.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:amalia=sad.png,What are you gonna use your ability for now? I'm scared...
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:cammy_white=sad.png,Oh, hey... Don't cry, Cammy. I know we didn't get along at first, but you can do this.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:elizabeth=shocked.png,What is that portal?! Did you do it?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:futaba=embarrassed.png,You're younger than me, but you're still taking this a lot better than I would, Futaba.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:juri=serious.png,You don't look even the least bit worried that you lost.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:misato=sad.png,Your turn, Misato. Wait, are you drunk?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:navi=sad.png,Eh... Those look like those weird seeds Usopp uses for fighting, the ones that sprout giant plants.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:nayru,targetSayingMarker:n_forfeit=shocked.png,G-go away, strange black thing! Leave Nayru alone!
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:remilia=shocked.png,You lost? Eh... seeing you fly with those wings is so creepy. They're just like a bat's.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:rin=sad.png,Oh, you lost Rin. Ehm... how are you gonna do this?
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:sayaka=smug.png,You should've paid more attention to the game instead of focusing on this hypothetical witch.
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:shimakaze=shocked.png,SHIMAKAZE!
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:weiss_schnee=annoyed.png,Oh, come on. Don't pretend like you've never done this just because you're rich and fancy.
-1-female_start_masturbating=smiling.png,You know, it isn't so bad, ~name~. I got through it, and I'm not that brave.
-1-female_start_masturbating=happy.png,But now I'm convinced a woman can get through this with her head held high. I did!
-1-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;pinkie_pie:,id:69=annoyed.png,A balloon? Are you seriously gonna use a balloon for...? Okay...
-1-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;lotte:=sad.png,Oh, I thought you were gonna use the ball for something else. Am I actually a pervert?
-1-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;estelle:,id:71=smug.png,What wrong? The fancy lady can't sit on the floor? That's a nice looking chair too.
-1-female_start_masturbating,count-role;target&character;sola:=shocked.png,Wow, are you sure that's safe? In my experience, glowing lights always mean trouble. And if it's down there...
-1-female_start_masturbating,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:183=serious.png,I don't get it. If you wanted to touch yourself so much, why go through all the trouble of playing this game?
-1-female_start_masturbating,filter:exhibitionist,oneShotId:183=serious.png,Wouldn't it have been easier if you'd done this somewhere else instead of having to lose this game? Somewhere far away?
-1-female_start_masturbating,filter:tandem=smiling.png,Hey, your friend is here. Are you two going to...? Oh, yeah. Okay...
-1-female_start_masturbating,filter:tandem=thinking.png,Oh, I guess you needed backup. Not the kind of thing I'd want help with, but I'm not judging.
-1-female_start_masturbating,filter:tandem=calm.png,Are you sure you're okay doing this with your friend? Oh, seems like you are.
-1-female_start_masturbating,filter:villain,oneShotId:194=calm.png,I've met a lot of bad people in my life. After a while, it's hard to feel sorry for them.
-1-female_start_masturbating,filter:villain,oneShotId:194=calm.png,If you want people to feel sorry for you, become a better person.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:amalia=shocked.png,I don't have a dirty mind, it's just too obvious...
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:cammy_white=calm.png,Be strong. I'm sure you won't find it that hard after a while.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:elizabeth,targetSayingMarker:nightmare=shocked.png,Two Elizabeths... This is a terrifying Devil Fruit ability.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:futaba=smiling.png,Go, little sis! Show us what you got.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:jolyne=thinking.png,Is there something I'm not seeing here?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:juri=sad.png,(It was obvious from the beginning, but now more than every: this woman is a complete pervert.)
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:kizuna=calm.png,Okaaay... What are you waiting for exactly?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:miko=shocked.png,W-with the ghost? Sorry, I know she's your consort, but I can't help but find this creepy.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:misato=smug.png,Did you really get drunk drinking beer? We should have a drinking contest sometime, cause I'm sure I'll win.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:navi,id:43=shocked.png,I knew it! I hope you can take it, Navi.

-1-female_masturbating=embarrassed.png,How many ways are there for a girl to do this? I should ask Robin, I'm sure she knows more.
-1-female_masturbating=calm.png,Do you have a spot that is more sensitive, ~name~? For me, it's...
-1-female_masturbating=smiling.png,You should just relax while doing it, ~name~. We're not gonna judge your performance, or something.
-1-female_masturbating=smug.png,Didn't you learn anything from me, ~name~?

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.

-3-must_masturbate,id:12=custom:starting,Okay... If I have to do this, can I have my Clima-Tact back for a second? I want to use it. And no, it's not for that, you perverts!
-3-must_masturbate,id:12=custom:starting,<i>Sigh</i>... Hand me my Clima-Tact. I have something in mind. I don't have to explain it, a lot of people here do weird stuff for no reason.
-3-must_masturbate,id:12=custom:starting,Can I have my Clima-Tact for a second? There's something I want to do. You want me to do this right, huh? So let me have this.
-3-must_masturbate,id:12=custom:starting,Pass me my Clima-Tact. I want to use it for one thing. If you have a problem with this, complain to the people that made this vile game.

-3-start_masturbating,id:13=custom:starting2,There's not much privacy in the Sunny with all the guys roaming around, so I always do this in the shower. I call this my Shower Tempo.
-3-start_masturbating,id:13=custom:starting2,This is my Shower Tempo. Ah... That feels nice. The water makes me feel more comfortable when I... touch myself.
-3-start_masturbating,id:13=custom:starting2,I call this Shower Tempo. Maybe I just like to feel the water fall down my body when I pleasure myself. Is that so weird?
-3-start_masturbating,id:13=custom:starting2,I call this Shower Tempo. Why did I do it? Perhaps feeling the water falling down my body is my <i>thing</i>. People enjoy weirder stuff.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:chun-li=custom:starting2,That's why I call it my Shower Tempo. This is how I shower every time.
-3-start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:juri=custom:starting2,I'm not looking forward to having your eyes on me the whole time, you pervert psycho.

#masturbating
-2-masturbating=custom:calm,(I don't think anyone can tell I'm getting wet down here too. Just as planned.)
-2-masturbating=custom:embarrassed2,I feel more comfortable with the water falling down on me, but this is still very awkward with all the people watching.
-2-masturbating=custom:smiling,It's a good thing the water's warm.
-2-masturbating=custom:happy,So are you all impressed with my Clima-Tact? It's like magic, right?
-2-masturbating=custom:shocked,(I know it doesn't take too much touch to get me wet, but this is a surprise... The Shower Tempo was definitely a good idea.)
-2-masturbating=custom:calm,This cloud seems like magic, but it's just the science of Weatheria. I spent two years there learning and now... I'm using it for this.
-2-masturbating=custom:furious,If any of you spreads any rumors about me because of this, I'll personally find you and beat you up.
-2-masturbating=custom:embarrassed2,Why are you looking at me, you big dummy?
-2-masturbating=custom:embarrassed,All the attention feels oddly flattering...
-2-masturbating=custom:embarrassed,It's not weird to do this daily, right? I mean, I shower everyday, so...
-2-masturbating=custom:furious,Hey you! What are you doing...? Oh, sorry. I thought there was a peeping tom over there.
-2-masturbating=custom:greedy,I'll imagine this isn't just water, but gold raining down on me. That makes me even more excited.
-2-masturbating=custom:greedy,Do my eyes look different? Oh, sorry. I was picturing myself naked in a bathtub full of treasure.
-2-masturbating=custom:happy,You like my Shower Tempo, don't you? Maybe another time I'll show you some of my other tricks.
-2-masturbating=custom:sad,No one is gonna yell at me for using my Clima-Tact, right? I probably should've asked before, but I didn't think I was doing something wrong.
-2-masturbating=custom:sad,I could've never used my Shower Tempo in the Going Merry, or the floor would've been ruined. Oh, now I feel sad.
-2-masturbating=custom:seductive,I'm just gonna let myself enjoy this. I hope you are too.
-2-masturbating=custom:seductive,If I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna do it right. Touching every spot that makes my knees weak.
-2-masturbating=custom:serious,Where do you think you're looking? Don't you have other things to focus on?
-2-masturbating=custom:serious,I hope the cloud doesn't disappear before I finish.
-2-masturbating=custom:shocked,Did I take care of my tangerine trees today? Oh, yeah, I did. Sorry, I should just focus on what I'm doing.
-2-masturbating=custom:smiling,Ah... ah...Oh, that wasn't a moan. I just...
-2-masturbating=custom:smug,Does it look like I'm enjoying this? Well, maybe I am. Anything wrong with that?
-2-masturbating=custom:smug,My body is wet and hot. B-but it's because of the water. Of course...
-2-masturbating=custom:thinking,I guess I could've used warmer water to generate steam and reduce visibility. But that would've been cheating.
-2-masturbating=custom:thinking,(I usually don't last this long. I guess with so many people here it's harder...)
-2-masturbating=custom:annoyed,Do I seem angry? I'm just used to getting mad when people try to look at me taking a shower.
-2-masturbating=custom:annoyed,If anyone complains later about me making it rain here, I'll seriously get mad. Instead, you should thank me for going along with this.
-2-masturbating,priority:0,count-role;self&saidmarker;target2:=custom:calm,So be honest, ~player~: How happy are you that I lost? I don't blame you. I did try to make you lose, after all.
-2-masturbating,priority:0,count-role;self&saidmarker;target2:=custom:thinking,Why are you looking at me, ~player~? I thought you didn't like women.
-2-masturbating,priority:0,count-role;self&saidmarker;target2:=custom:seductive,Am I making you question your preferences, ~player~?
-2-masturbating,priority:0,count-role;self&saidmarker;target2:=custom:smiling,So what do you like in a man, ~player~? I'm just trying to see if we have something in common.
-2-masturbating,priority:0,count-role;self&saidmarker;target2:=custom:smiling,Now be honest, ~player~. Did you know I was trying to manipulate earlier, or did you just dodge a bullet by accident?
-2-masturbating,priority:0,count-role;self&saidmarker;target2:=custom:happy,Even if you don't like women, you gotta admit I look good under the rain. Huh, ~player~?
-2-masturbating,priority:0,count-role;self&saidmarker;target1:=custom:smiling,Why don't you join me, ~player~? The water is good... I'm kidding, I'm kidding!
-2-masturbating,priority:0,count-role;self&saidmarker;target1:=custom:seductive,Would you say my seduction tactics are better now than before, ~player~?
-2-masturbating,priority:0,count-role;self&saidmarker;target1:=custom:seductive,Do you like my hot, wet body, ~player~? What? Since when does a lady need permission to practice the art of seduction?
-2-masturbating,priority:0,count-role;self&saidmarker;target1:=custom:embarrassed,Don't look at me like that, ~player~. It makes me feel strange...
-2-masturbating,priority:0,count-role;self&saidmarker;target1:=custom:smug,You've done a good job resisting my charms, ~player~. But what about now?
-2-masturbating,priority:0,count-role;self&saidmarker;target1:=custom:calm,Are you imagining what it'd be like to run your hands over my body, ~player~? Heheh, it's so cute how you blush.
-2-masturbating,priority:0,test:~background.location~:outdoors=custom:thinking,The good thing about doing this outside is that no one will complain about me ruining the floor with the water.
-2-masturbating,priority:0,test:~background.location~:outdoors=custom:embarrassed2,Public masturbation. There's something I never thought I would ever do.
-2-masturbating,timeInStage:3-,saidMarker:target1,notSaidMarker:butt2,oneShotId:243,marker:butt2=custom:butt,You liked looking at my butt earlier. Didn't you, ~player~? You wanna take another look?
-2-masturbating,timeInStage:3-,saidMarker:target1,notSaidMarker:butt2,oneShotId:243,marker:butt2=custom:butt,How does the water flowing down these curves look, ~player~? You can tell me if you want. Actually, it would help me.
-2-masturbating,timeInStage:3-,saidMarker:target1,notSaidMarker:butt2,oneShotId:243,marker:butt2=custom:butt,So many are interested in seeing my breasts. It feels refreshing to see that you also like my butt, ~player~.
-2-heavy_masturbating=custom:heavy,Oh, I didn't think it would feel this good!
-2-heavy_masturbating=custom:heavy,I can't stand up anymore...
-2-heavy_masturbating=custom:heavy,This feels great!
-2-heavy_masturbating=custom:heavy,More... I want more...
-2-heavy_masturbating=custom:heavy,This is... so intense...
-2-heavy_masturbating=custom:heavy,I'm going... I'm going to...
-2-heavy_masturbating=custom:heavy,Rain, don't stop. I'm so close...
-2-finishing_masturbating=custom:finishing,Ah... KYAAAAHHH!!!

-1-finished_masturbating=thinking.png,I should go buy drawing supplies before I return to the ship. I'm running out of paper for drawing my maps.
-1-finished_masturbating=embarrassed.png,Why are you still looking at me? I'm not doing anything anymore. Is it just because you find me cute?
-1-finished_masturbating=calm.png,You have no idea how tired I am, but I suppose I can stay until the game is over.
-1-finished_masturbating=calm.png,You'd think that for a navigator in a pirate crew, weird activities like these are normal for me. And you're not wrong, but this was still one of the weirdest.
-1-finished_masturbating=smiling.png,Now that I think about it, I could've used my Mirage Tempo to escape before having to do the forfeit. So why didn't I? Just because I was having fun? Maybe...
-1-finished_masturbating=furious.png,If any of you talk to anyone about what you saw here today, I'll track you down and kick your ass. I'm serious!
-1-finished_masturbating=furious.png,What if while I was here my crew mates spent all the money we have on useless crap? Just the thought makes me so angry!
-1-finished_masturbating=greedy.png,Despite everything I've said before, money isn't the most important thing in the world. But it's pretty close.
-1-finished_masturbating=greedy.png,(By my estimations, all the valuables gathered here should amount to a total of at least 5 million beli. That's not bad at all.)
-1-finished_masturbating=happy.png,Do you think I look better with a ponytail or with my hair loose, ~player~? I'm always changing my hairstyle.
-1-finished_masturbating=happy.png,Oh, I got a good idea! I should play Poker with my crew. Most of them are morons, so I'm sure I can clean them out.
-1-finished_masturbating=sad.png,This is by far the most degrading thing I've done for money. (I just hope it'll be worth it.)
-1-finished_masturbating=sad.png,I know I might seem too greedy at times. But you never know the true value of money until you have nothing.
-1-finished_masturbating=seductive.png,I bet you'd never played Strip Poker with a girl as cute as me. Too bad it'll never happen again. Well, unless I feel like it.
-1-finished_masturbating=seductive.png,The guys would've died of a heart attack if they'd seen the show I performed for you today. I almost feel bad for them for missing it.
-1-finished_masturbating=serious.png,It sure would've been awkward if I'd ran into a Marine or a member of the World Government here. Though I doubt any of them frequent this place.
-1-finished_masturbating=serious.png,I hope my crew mates haven't burned down the ship while I've been here. They're hopeless without me.
-1-finished_masturbating=shocked.png,W-what if there's was a photographer of the newspaper here, they took my picture, and it shows up in the next publication? Or in my wanted poster? I'd rather die...
-1-finished_masturbating=shocked.png,Wait, where did I keep my Vivre card? Was it in my top? Oh, shoot! I hope I didn't lose it.
-1-finished_masturbating=smug.png,Were you all surprised that a pirate girl like me can be so easygoing and harmless? Too bad not every pirate is like that.
-1-finished_masturbating=smug.png,I'm sure you all think I'm a loser in this game, but we'll see who wins in the end. (Oops, I almost said too much.)
-1-finished_masturbating=annoyed.png,Can you guys play a little faster? You know, it's kinda boring here now.
-1-finished_masturbating=annoyed.png,What is it about this place that makes the players follow the rules? It's not like the security is that good.
-1-finished_masturbating,count-role;other&character;jessie:,id:82=custom:finished,Hey! This puddle is just water, Jessie. Okay?

-1-finished_masturbating,oneShotId:17,count-role;self&saidmarker;target1:,test:~_.tag.human_male~:true=embarrassed.png,I'm sorry I tried seducing you earlier, ~player~. I assume you knew I was faking, and that's why it didn't work. I do find you cute, though. I'm serious, I have no reason to lie anymore.
-1-finished_masturbating,notSaidMarker:finished,priority:101,id:14,marker:finished=custom:finished,T-that was all water, okay? I didn't squirt or anything. And that had nothing to do with me making it rain. My hair is still wet, I'll tie it up for now.
