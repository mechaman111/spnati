#When selecting the characters to play the game, the first line will always play, then it randomly picks from any of the start lines after you commence the game but before you deal the first hand.
start=0-,This is what the character says after they've been selected if the new triggers aren't used


#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermione=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!

0-stripping=strip,Your hat has been returned to the hat rack in your room, Milady.
0-stripping=strip,It has been done, Milady. Lady Yukari has made it quite easy to return to the Mansion.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:uravity=strip,<i>Oho.</i> You're sharper than you look, to see through Sakuya's powers so easily.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:uravity=strip,You fail to recognise my own powers, yet understand my maid's in a heartbeat? What a strange little human you are.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura=strip,I have lived for over 600 years now, blondie. If I am a child to you, you must be a relic from a bygone age, no?
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura=strip,At the age of 600, I still get mistaken for a child. You are but a fraction of that, yet I'm sure you still get mistaken for a grandmother.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura=strip,I would hope that you could mask that envy of yours just a little bit. It's quite unbefitting of a lady to gripe so loudly.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura=strip,Does it wound you, that one who appears to be a child is far superior in beauty and grace?
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:miko=strip,How brazen of you to be flattering me so blatantly, Taoist. Perhaps I will need to rethink my opinion of you.

0-stripping,alsoPlaying:mia=strip,I am known as the 'Perfect and Elegant Maid', Miss Fey. It is my duty to complete tasks issued to me in such a manner.
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:mia=strip,It is my obligation to do as Milady commands, Miss Fey. To not do so to the best of my ability would stain my reputation as the 'Perfect and Elegant Maid'.

1-stripped=pleased,It is quite comforting to know that we will be able to return to Gensokyo once we are done. Well then? Shall we start the next round?
1-stripped=pleased,I am pleased that that old hag has made herself useful, for once. As long as we can return home at the end of the day, I will have no complaints about her.
1-stripped=pleased,You were able to return, is it? That is good news indeed. While I have no issues with remaining in the human world, I <i>would</i> grow to miss the Mansion.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura=smug,Did you miss that, grandma? I suppose older ladies <i>do</i> tend to have their eyesight worsen when they reach such an advanced age.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura=smug,What's wrong, blondie, becoming senile already? Are your eyes okay, or is it your brain that can't keep up?
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura=smug,Do I really need to spell it out to you, old lady? Yes, I have removed my hat. Has your age really caused your brain to rot that quickly?
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura=smug,My, my. Yes, I <i>did</i> remove my hat. I am glad you've noticed - it seems that you've managed to keep your mind sharp, even at that age.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:zizou,saidMarker:zizstrip=pleased,While less of a visual spectacle, I do believe it's quite impressive, nonetheless.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity=questioning,Did I mention Gensokyo..? No matter. It is a different world, both quite near and quite far away from this one. Any more would bore me, so let us return to the game.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity=pleased,When did I say Gensokyo..? It is a world both separated and attached to this one. Any further explanation will have to wait, girl - there is a game to be played.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:miko=questioning,While I have no problems accomodating my little sister's friends, I <i>do</i> have problems with your feeble attempt at <i>Flandre</i>'s name.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jotaro=interested,<i>Oh</i>? I can sense it from your eyes, tall boy - <i>you saw that</i>, didn't you? <i>Ufufu</i>, how very interesting!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:mia=bored,It was no small feat to arrive here to begin with, and without the help of Miss Yukari, it would be even more difficult to return. Prison is no understatement.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:mia=questioning,Believe me, it was no small feat to arrive here to begin with. The human world may as well be a prison to a resident of Gensokyo.
1-must_strip_winning=smugger,In the grand scheme of things, this loss means little. Sakuya, if you'd please.
1-must_strip_winning=smug,This is only my second loss, but I am simply wearing <i>far</i> too much. Sakuya, we must remedy this.

1-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:miko=questioning,Are you <i>deaf</i>, Taoist? Or are you butchering poor Flandre's name on purpose?

1-must_strip_losing=smug,Not one, but two wins? I am glad to see you are all doing your very best to take me down! Here, I will reward you all for your efforts.
1-must_strip_losing=pleased,I am quite fond of a good challenge. Very few fights will see me with my back against the wall... Perhaps I will up the ante for this one.
1-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:miko=questioning,Are you <i>deaf</i>, Taoist? Or are you butchering poor Flandre's name on purpose?
1-stripping=strip,I am feeling generous this round. I will remove both my socks and my shoes.
1-stripping=strip,Sakuya will take off my shoes <i>and</i> my socks for this round. I will allow this small mercy to my foes.
1-stripping=strip,Rejoice, for my gift to all of you will be to remove two layers for this round. Sakuya. My socks and my shoes - you may take them away.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:mia=strip,I will remove both my socks and my shoes for you all, and you offer such a paltry reply as that, chaneller? <i>You wound me</i>!

#losing dress
2-stripped=afterstrip,Savour this moment, for this is as far as I will be going this game.
2-stripped=afterstrip,This is, after all, the most bare skin I will be exposing this game.
2-stripped=afterstrip,A master knows when to reward her pets. Do <i>not</i> allow my generosity to go to waste.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:miko=afterstrip,For the sake of this fine establishment, I will pretend I didn't hear you relate me to a <i>petty succubus</i>, Taoist. That, and your thinly-veiled lust towards my gatekeeper.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity=pleased,I only demand that which I deserve, little one.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity=delicious,I would think that I am actually quite reasonable. For example, I have not demanded you present me your neck on a silver platter. <i>Yet</i>.
2-must_strip_winning=interested,It appears that you've managed to overcome my first challenge. For a bunch of lowborns, you are putting up an impressive fight!
2-must_strip_winning=interested,It was a hard fought battle, but you have <i>finally</i> managed to take another round off of me.
2-must_strip_winning=bored,And here I thought I would do naught but stand here for the rest of the game! You certainly took your time to win a round off of me.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:uravity=bored,Did you not listen to my introduction? I go by many titles. Sakuya, if you would please?
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:uravity=bored,If you had been paying attention, you would have heard Sakuya call me by my titles. I will have her tell you them once again.

2-must_strip_normal=pleased,<i>Hmph.</i> You've bested me once again? Well, I suppose I mustn't let your efforts go unrewarded.
2-must_strip_normal=pleased,I was under the impression you would never best me again, but it appears I was wrong. Very well then, I will remove something else.
2-must_strip_normal=pleased,Did you manage to best me once more? It seems that fate was on your side, for this round at least.

2-stripping=strip,Few may cast their eyes on the great Remilia Scarlet laying herself bare. To have earned this right, you must all be quivering in joy!
2-stripping=strip,I offer you all a round of applause, for very few are allowed to cast their eyes on the unclothed beauty of Remilia Scarlet. Bravo, peasants, bravo.

3-stripped=thirst,Sakuya! I am quite peckish, and I'd <i>hate</i> to... <i>make a mess</i> in front of all these people. Fetch me a drink.
3-stripped=thirst,However, I am beginning to become quite parched - Sakuya, go bring me something to drink.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity=thirst,But of course, I much prefer the simplicity of 'The Scarlet Devil'. Anyhow, Sakuya, I'm quite parched. Fetch me a drink, will you?
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity=thirst,I go by many titles, but 'The Scarlet Devil' is the one I prefer. This game is making me quite thirsty - Sakuya, would you bring me a drink?
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:miko=zucc,You may have been joking, Miko, but <i>I definitely wasn't.</i>
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:miko=zucc,You'll forgive me if it's hard to believe you, Hermit. I hope you'll continue to forgive me after I've <i>torn you to shreds</i>.

3-must_strip_winning=muststrip,I am glad to see my advantage has not stolen away your hopes of winning.

3-must_strip_normal=muststrip,Sakuya. I do not need to explain my next move, yes?
3-must_strip_normal=muststrip,Sakuya. It should be obvious which item of clothing needs to be removed next.
3-must_strip_normal=muststrip,Sakuya. Remove the next item.
3-must_strip_losing=muststrip,Another loss? <i>Hmph</i>. So be it. Sakuya?

4-stripped=zucc,Do you expect me to have a grand speech prepared for each and every action of this game? Carry on, Dealer.
4-stripped=zucc,Did you want me to say more? Have you become that enamoured with me?
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity=zucc,I do <i>not</i> require a mere <i>human</i> to tell me what I can and cannot do.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity=zucc,Many thanks for the advice, little one. I'll be sure to ignore it just like all the other things humans tend to rant about.
4-must_strip_winning=muststrip,Oh? Was that your last hurrah? There is still some fight in you all, it seems! Wonderful!
4-must_strip_winning=muststrip,For all your faults, the tenacity of humankind is quite impressive! I too, then, will show off my own pride!

4-must_strip_losing=muststrip,If I'm in this position, I guess I have no choice but to take you all seriously now!
4-must_strip_losing=muststrip,Perhaps I have been playing around a little too much. Very well, peons! It is time for me to take this seriously!
4-stripping=strip,Rejoice! Only a few have been blessed with a glimpse at my true power!
4-stripping=strip,<i>Kyu, fu- fufufu!</i> I certainly do wish you luck, commoners. Something tells me that you will need it, since fate is now in my grasp.
4-stripping=strip,Now then, what will you do now that even fortune herself has forsaken you all?
4-stripping=strip,They say one cannot go against their fate. You all should take their advice.

5-stripped=zucc,Few have managed to rise up against their fates. Will you all join their ranks, or will you succumb to destiny?
5-stripped=zucc,I have witnessed few people who could break the chains of destiny. I am not expecting to encounter more today, but I am open to being pleasantly surprised.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity=zucc,Me? The great Remilia Scarlet? Drunk? Of course not.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity=zucc,I may appear to be short in stature, but I <i>am</i> over 600 years old. I can handle my drinks just fine.

5-must_strip_winning=muststrip,My apologies, Milady, but it appears Lady Flandre has escaped from the basement. I'm afraid Patchouli requires my assistance.
5-must_strip_winning=muststrip,Milady. I am sorry to report, but Patchouli has alerted me that Lady Flandre has broken out of the basement. I must return to the Mansion.

5-stripping=strip,That damned mischevious sister of mine! Very well, Sakuya, go if needs must!
5-stripping=strip,Flan, why must you have chosen <i>now</i> of all times to fool around!? Do whatever you must, Sakuya! I will be much longer!
5-stripping,count-hero:1-3=strip,I can handle these fools by myself, anyway! Have at you!
5-stripping,count-hero:1-3=strip,So be it, Sakuya! These are but men, naught more than a miserable little pile of secrets!
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:miko=strip,A playdate? Now, of all times?
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:uravity=strip,Do you think that I would throw knives at myself like this?
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:uravity=strip,The knives are <i>Sakuya's</i>, not my own.

-3-stripped=afterstrip,<i>Ahem</i>. You may have taken my final layer, but I won't lose this last hand so easily.
-3-stripped=afterstrip,If Flan is out causing chaos, then it is unlikely Sakuya will return quickly. Regardless, let us continue.
-3-stripped=afterstrip,Sakuya and Patchouli will be more than enough to take care of that cheeky little sister of mine.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity=afterstrip,Have we not had this conversation before, little girl, or is your tiny human brain incapable of retaining even the simplest of information? Miss <i>Remilia.</i>
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity=afterstrip,Are you some kind of imbecile, or are you forgetting my name on purpose in an attempt to rile me up? My name is <i>Remilia</i>.

3-female_must_strip,target:miko,targetStage:0=shocked,Wait, <i>Miko</i>? Are you not the one who calls herself the Christian Pope?
3-female_must_strip,target:miko,targetStage:1=shocked,You intend to take off so little? I suppose I shouldn't expect any integrity from a mere human, after all.
3-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:2=pleased,At this point, Nugi-chan, I don't think there are any problems with your mannerisms at all.
3-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:3=questioning,It's a shame we can't test your skills as a maid, Nugi. While your... <i>entertainment</i> skills are fine, there are other areas a maid should specialize in.

3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=interested,Tell me, Meia, you would need a ship to travel to and from this planet, no?
3-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:4=interested,I sense that you also have a poor opinion of humanity.

3-female_must_strip,target:miko,targetStage:2=questioning,Miko, were you not the one responsible for that 'divine spirit incident' a while ago?
3-female_must_strip,target:miko,targetStage:3=smugger,It is a little too early to be panicking, Pope. Do you not see the necklace still wrapped around your neck?
3-female_must_strip,target:miko,targetStage:4=smug,Do not get so worked up about a mere <i>card game</i>, Pope.
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=bored,From what I've picked up, you aren't from this world, are you, space woman?
3-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:3=pleased,Well then, Zizou. You know, Gensokyo has a way of self-regulating magic and its use - the 'spellcard system'.
3-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:1=interested,<i>Ufufu.</i> Sakuya - this girl, what did she say her name was?
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=questioning,Blue-haired woman. Tell me, what was that 'eyepiece' that you removed earlier?
3-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:4=interested,I can see the flow of one's fate, but I cannot see their past.
3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=shocked,Is that a sword? No, it's not just a sword, but a <i>rapier</i>!
3-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=questioning,Sakuya. Tell me, what is that strange object that woman has over her eyes?
3-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=interested,I wonder... Sakuya? Who do you believe would win in an encounter between Meiling and this eastern pugilist?
3-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=interested,Oh? What's this? An eastern martial artist?
3-female_must_strip,target:cammy,targetStage:1=pleased,Your bad premonition is suprisingly accurate, woman.
3-female_must_strip,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=questioning,I suppose we'll be seeing another explosion any time now.
3-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=questioning,An oni princess? How bizarre. I did not know the oni had a noble class at all.
3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=pleased,Finally. Is it time for little miss plant princess to be give us a show?
3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=pleased,Now then, little plant princess, we can finally get back to the main event.
3-female_must_strip,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4=bored,I do have to ask, though - are you going to explode <i>every</i> time you take something off?
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:4=bored,Once more, then? There's little else you could do with your gun at this point.
3-female_must_strip,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=disgusted,I should have known you were a youkai, girl. There's a acrid smell to your blood that reminds me of the alcohol those oni drink.
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:3=bored,Can't that little gun of yours fire in more than one direction? No?
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=questioning,Sakuya. That trick with the bouncing projectiles - isn't that quite similar to your technique with those knives?
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=questioning,That large weapon is a firearm, is it not, Saku-
3-female_must_strip,target:shimakaze,targetStage:6=embarrassed,I'm not exactly fond of rabbits. I may have had a certain... <i>bad experience</i> with them in the past. <i>Those damn Lunarians.</i>
3-female_must_strip,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetTimeInStage:0-0,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=interested,Oh? It appears that the speedy one is coming back around.
3-female_must_strip,target:shimakaze,targetStage:7=shocked,Ah-! Is it time for you to remove your last piece of clothing, tsukumogami?
3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=interested,It's quite interesting to see that humans have unlocked some sort of latent powers within them.
3-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=interested,You said humans have managed to find some powers... called "quirks", no? How very amusing!
3-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:1=bored,I wasn't quite listening - what did you say you were a goddess of, purple one? Butterflies?
3-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=pleased,Would you look at that! It appears the grey goddess has lost!
3-female_must_strip,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=questioning,Oh, yes, Shimikaze. I have to ask you - were you designed after a rabbit?
3-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:2=pleased,Oh, of course! I simply <i>must</i> bring Meiling along with me next time.
3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=pleased,It seems we will be finally ridding you of that little garden you have built up, plant princess.
3-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=pleased,Say goodbye to your sad little excuse for 'clothing', plant princess.
3-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=shocked,...You, floating woman, are you not a vampire?
3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:2=questioning,Sakuya, isn't one of your spellcards named "Marinette" as well?
3-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=questioning,It's quite odd to see someone clothed from head to toe like that. Sakuya, is that some sort of human fashion?
3-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=questioning,Anyway, were you saying something to me before, oni princess?
3-female_must_strip,target:haru,targetStage:0=interested,My, my. What a fluffy looking human!
3-female_must_strip,target:kizuna,targetStage:1=questioning,Now then- Sakuya! What is this "virtuous ewe tuber" you speak of?
3-female_must_strip,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=questioning,This blonde girl certainly is quite bizarre, to be so excited about losing a hand.
3-female_must_strip,target:kizuna,targetStage:0=wait,After investigating some more, Lady Remilia, I have found out that she is a "Virtual Youtuber".
3-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:2=bored,Again with the gun trick? <i>Sigh</i>.
3-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1=pleased,Nothing quite speaks of one's nobility like a fine blade made of cold steel, much unlike those boorish firearms humans so love.
3-female_must_strip,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=questioning,Now that we've gotten your misunderstanding over with, tell me, Shimikaze: You aren't human, are you?
3-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:2=questioning,Tell me, half-color. What is it that a goddess of balance even does?

5-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:0=pleased,Would you look at that! It appears the grey goddess has lost!
5-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1=questioning,Sakuya. That trick with the bouncing projectiles - isn't that quite similar to your technique with those knives?
5-female_must_strip,target:shimakaze,targetStage:6=embarrassed,I'm not exactly fond of rabbits. I may have had a certain... <i>bad experience</i> with them in the past. <i>Those damn Lunarians.</i>

5-female_must_strip,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=questioning,Oh, yes, Shimikaze. I have to ask you - were you designed after a rabbit?
5-female_must_strip,target:zizou,targetStage:1=bored,I wasn't quite listening - what did you say you were a goddess of, purple one? Butterflies?

5-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=questioning,That large weapon is a firearm, is it not, Saku-
5-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=interested,It's quite interesting to see that humans have unlocked some sort of latent powers within them.
5-female_must_strip,target:uravity,targetStage:0=interested,You said humans have managed to find some powers... called "quirks", no? How very amusing!
5-female_must_strip,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=questioning,I suppose we'll be seeing another explosion any time now.
5-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:2=questioning,Sakuya, isn't one of your spellcards named "Marinette" as well?
5-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=questioning,Sakuya. Tell me, what is that strange object that woman has over her eyes?
5-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:1=questioning,Blue-haired woman. Tell me, what was that 'eyepiece' that you removed earlier?
5-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:4=interested,I can see the flow of one's fate, but I cannot see their past.
5-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:2=bored,From what I've picked up, you aren't from this world, are you, space woman?
5-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:4=interested,Tell me, Meia, you would need a ship to travel to and from this planet, no?
5-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:3=shocked,Those are... firearms, are they not?
5-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=questioning,An oni princess? How bizarre. I did not know the oni had a noble class at all.
5-female_must_strip,target:miko,targetStage:0=shocked,Wait, <i>Miko</i>? Are you not the one who calls herself the Christian Pope?
5-female_must_strip,target:miko,targetStage:2=questioning,Miko, were you not the one responsible for that 'divine spirit incident' a while ago?
5-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:1=interested,<i>Ufufu.</i> Sakuya - this girl, what did she say her name was?
5-female_must_strip,target:miko,targetStage:3=smugger,It is a little too early to be panicking, Pope. Do you not see the necklace still wrapped around your neck?
5-female_must_strip,target:miko,targetStage:4=smug,Do not get so worked up about a mere <i>card game</i>, Pope.
5-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:3=questioning,It's a shame we can't test your skills as a maid, Nugi. While your... <i>entertainment</i> skills are fine, there are other areas a maid should specialize in.
5-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=pleased,Finally. Is it time for little miss plant princess to be give us a show?
5-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:5=pleased,Now then, little plant princess, we can finally get back to the main event.
5-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1=pleased,It has been just a short while, but I see no issues with the maid's performance thus far.
5-female_must_strip,target:miko,targetStage:1=shocked,You intend to take off so little? I suppose I shouldn't expect any integrity from a mere human, after all.
5-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=questioning,It's quite odd to see someone clothed from head to toe like that. Sakuya, is that some sort of human fashion?
5-female_must_strip,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=interested,Oh? A maid? Have you come here with your master? Or are you under the employment of this establishment?
5-female_must_strip,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=questioning,Now that we've gotten your misunderstanding over with, tell me, Shimikaze: You aren't human, are you?
5-female_must_strip,target:kizuna,targetStage:1=questioning,Now then- Sakuya! What is this "virtuous ewe tuber" you speak of?
5-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1=pleased,Nothing quite speaks of one's nobility like a fine blade made of cold steel, much unlike those boorish firearms humans so love.
5-female_must_strip,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=questioning,This blonde girl certainly is quite bizarre, to be so excited about losing a hand.
5-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=shocked,Is that a sword? No, it's not just a sword, but a <i>rapier</i>!
5-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=pleased,It seems we will be finally ridding you of that little garden you have built up, plant princess.
5-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:6=pleased,Say goodbye to your sad little excuse for 'clothing', plant princess.
5-female_must_strip,target:haru,targetStage:0=interested,My, my. What a fluffy looking human!
5-female_must_strip,target:kizuna,targetStage:0=wait,After investigating some more, Lady Remilia, I have found out that she is a "Virtual Youtuber".
5-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=interested,I wonder... Sakuya? Who do you believe would win in an encounter between Meiling and this eastern pugilist?
5-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=questioning,Anyway, were you saying something to me before, oni princess?
5-female_must_strip,target:marceline,targetStage:0=shocked,...You, floating woman, are you not a vampire?
5-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:2=pleased,Oh, of course! I simply <i>must</i> bring Meiling along with me next time.
5-female_must_strip,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=disgusted,I should have known you were a youkai, girl. There's a acrid smell to your blood that reminds me of the alcohol those oni drink.
5-female_must_strip,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=interested,Oh? What's this? An eastern martial artist?
5-female_must_strip,target:cammy,targetStage:1=pleased,Your bad premonition is suprisingly accurate, woman.

#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

3-female_removed_accessory=concerned,Dealer, Milady grows impatient. I believe you should deal the next hand already.

3-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:3=smugger,There is a fine line between foolishness and bravery. I wonder to which side of the line you lie, Revy?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=pleased,<i>Oho</i>? So your title is Revy? Very well, I will remember this.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1=wait,As the head maid of the Scarlet Devil Mansion, I too am interested in the works of a maid from the human world.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:4=embarrassed,S-such insolent behaviour! I have grown fond of you, girl, but I won't let such mockeries slide.

3-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=smugger,Matters of religion mean little to me - I'm not interested in stealing souls, nor enslaving man.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=smug,To think one with such a title as 'Saint' would be so petty.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=angry,If only those idiots didn't turn their party venues into giant craters most of the time, <i>especially</i> whenever they decide to barge in on my own little gatherings...

3-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=interested,Meiling often speaks about how she has honed her mind to be able to sense bloodlust, even while asleep. Pugilists are quite interesting, it seems.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1=pleased,No, that won't be neccessary. It is much simpler to just ask this human about it whenever it seems prudent.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=bored,That phrase means nothing to me, but I would assume <i>you</i> would understand what it means, martial artist.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:2=delicious,Funny you should say that. I was of the same opinion.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=shocked,Oh, like the puppet? It appears I was mistaken.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:1=delicious,I wonder, then. <i>Will your blood taste as sweet as your demeanour?</i>
3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=smug,Hide? A hero who feels the need to <i>hide</i>? How petty these human heroes are!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4=embarrassed,O-of course I know what headphones are! They're... phones for your head. Of course.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=interested,Perhaps you may have some class after all, blonde human. You may even be worth paying attention to, at this rate.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:marceline,targetStage:1=angry,You <i>disgusting, impure half-blood!</i> The <i>audacity</i>, to appear in front of a noble such as I! Do you wish for me to end your pitiful existance that badly?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=smugger,Oh, you're removing clothing with the snap of your fingers? <i>How original.</i>
3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=pleased,So it's possession, as opposed to gaining sentience? My, eastern folklore is quite interesting.

3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=delicious,My my, is that so? I may need to organise a bit of... <i>sport</i>... while I am here in the human world.

-3-female_removed_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:3=smugger,I'd say that some would find that sort of behaviour quite endearing. Sakuya certainly is reliable, but she can be far too stoic at times.

-3-female_removed_minor,target:meia,targetStage:2=interested,Well, there are residents of Gensokyo who had adorned themselves with stranger things, so I suppose that is fine.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=smugger,Couldn't you have made a more complex pattern? I could dodge that with my eyes closed.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=pleased,Why bother tempering my blows to achieve some bizarre gimmick? I much prefer a frontal approach, anyway.

#OPPONENT REMOVING MAJOR CLOTHING
#Major clothing reveals a significant amount of skin and likely underwear.
#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

3-male_removed_major=pleased,It is an admirable start. I do hope, however, that you keep this up.
3-male_removed_major=smugger,Keep this up, and I may even commit your name to memory.
3-male_removed_major=pleased,Your efforts are admirable, commoner. Perhaps you will be able to entertain me after all.

-1-male_chest_is_visible=concerned,I suppose you have indeed shown some skin, but I would prefer something a little more interesting next.
-1-male_chest_is_visible=concerned,The chest of a woman is at least somewhat exciting. The chest of a man? Much less so.
-1-male_chest_is_visible=concerned,Well... I do apologise. I don't see much to comment on, quite honestly.
-1-male_chest_is_visible=delicious,I prefer a little more meat on the bones, myself. A healthy chunk of muscle to go with my drinks.
-1-male_chest_is_visible,saidMarker:mensokyo1,notSaidMarker:mensokyo2,priority:500,marker:mensokyo2=concerned,Well, at least male <i>youkai</i>. Human men are still fairly common.

-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible=delicious,This is the start of the real show, is it not?
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible=delicious,Here's where everybody gets what they really want, isn't it?
-1-male_crotch_will_be_visible=delicious,Finally, the main event begins!
-1-male_small_crotch_is_visible=smugger,<i>Pft-!</i> I-is that, t-that all you have to show us?
-1-male_small_crotch_is_visible=smugger,<i>Wah-!</i> It's so small and cute, just like a baby's!

-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=interested,Ah, well, I suppose this is still the prelude to the main show...
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=interested,Just a teaser, then? <i>I can't wait.</i>
-1-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=concerned,Not showing any more for now? You are quite a tease.

-1-male_large_crotch_is_visible=disgusted,J-just because there are few men in Gensokyo, doesn't mean you can make fun of me with a fake p-p-penis..!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible=concerned,<i>Oh?</i> A woman's chest, laid bare before me... eh, well, it's nothing special, I don't think.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible=concerned,The land of Gensokyo is known for it's female population. I'm no stranger to seeing a woman's chest.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible=concerned,It's not uncommon to see a pair of bare breasts during a drunken revelry in Gensokyo, so this is nothing new.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible=concerned,What? Did you expect me to be some kind of rampaging lesbian, or something? What gave you that impression?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=smugger,If you can't fire in all directions around yourself, you'll never catch anyone in your barrages.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=delicious,A single sweep with my dear Gungnir would have turned your adorable little display to ashes. However...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=delicious,Had I really been frustrated, it would have taken me no more than a single swing of Gungnir to disperse your petty little garden. However...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=bored,Evidently not. Does your cowardice know no bounds?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=bored,You would <i>still</i> cower behind your little flowers? My word, what a sad little girl I must deal with.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible=smug,<i>My</i> chest is small due to my unique vampiric physiology. What's <i>your</i> excuse?
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible=smug,Some would say a small chest allows one to get closer to the heart. It's true - <i>for my fangs, at least.</i>
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible=delicious,They say poor blood circulation in the chest leads to smaller breasts. <i>I can help with that</i>, if you desire.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=questioning,It's a perfectly average set of breasts. I see nothing worth praising.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=questioning,I'm sure you're well aware of how <i>absolutely average</i> your chest is. What do you want me to say?
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=questioning,Do you not understand yet, plebeian? You need to <i>impress me</i> if you want to be respected, not <i>bore me</i>.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=smug,Noble in title, but with the pride of a common serf. What a shameful display.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:6=smug,Renounce your title, 'princess'. If you cannot overcome this tribulation, you do not deserve such a thing.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=smug,Some would argue a barrage is more effective than an accurate stream, but it looks like neither of those apply to <i>your</i> gunfire.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible=smug,What an absurdly gargantuan pair of mammaries. Are you a human, or a dairy cow?
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible=smug,I appreciate you fattening yourself up, but all the nutrition is in the wrong places.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible=disgusted,There is far too much fat in your chest, woman. I prefer my meat lean, thank you very much.

-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:enm=interested,<i>Hooh</i>. To be so ashamed of your own nudity...

-1-female_crotch_is_visible=interested,Just a teaser, then? <i>I can't wait.</i>

-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=delicious,An impressive build up of energy, plant princess! I wasn't expecting a fight today, but I will not shy away from a battle!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:enm=smug,It is that lack of pride which will prevent you from becoming anything more than a lowborn plebeian.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:enm=smug,How very human, to be utterly incapable of having pride in one's own form!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:enm=smug,I, too, would be ashamed of myself if I were a lowly human.

#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.
