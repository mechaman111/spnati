#When selecting the characters to play the game, the first line will always play, then it randomly picks from any of the start lines after you commence the game but before you deal the first hand.


#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermione=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!

#When swapping cards, the game will automatically put a display a number between 0-5 where you write ~cards~.
#These lines display on the screen for only a brief time, so it is important to make them short enough to read at a glance.

1-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s=confident,Well, I do use it as a weapon, but the yo-yo itself can be used to create objects and restore damaged and broken things. My Lucky Charm really is quite powerful!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:aella,alsoPlayingStage:0=wink,Well, I'm not exactly a wizard, Aella! But I do know a few magic tricks.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:aella,alsoPlayingStage:0=confident,Well, I'm not a wizard, but I've got a lot of expertise in all kinds of stuff. I love to build and create!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:aimee=confused,Um...What? No, it's... Just a yo-yo, Aimee.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:aimee=wink,What? No, it's way cooler! It lets me purify butterflies that have been corrupted by evil magic. Obviously.

1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jenetta=confident,I'd love to do that, Jenetta! Point me at the akuma near your inn, and I'll happily take care of them!

2-stripped=confused,I wish I could just take off the mask... but, you know, magic. I’ll keep the earrings on.
2-stripped=embarrassed,Well. I'm glad I never really got into that whole "go nude under your costume" thing like Alya did.
2-stripped=wink,If you thought that transformation was interesting, what if I told you that costume can adapt to its environment, too?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s=wink,Tactical visor? Like your <i>blindfold</i>? Sorry, 9S, sometimes a mask is just a mask! When you have your wits you don’t really need elaborate user interfaces to get the job done.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:aella,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=embarrassed,E-er, I chasn't-- I wasn't cheating, Aella! I just. Erm. I came here because I thought people needed saving. I always wear clothes under my costume!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:aella,alsoPlayingStage:3-6=alarmed,Aella! I didn't make <i>more</i>clothes, I've always been dressed like this under the suit!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:aimee=embarrassed,I know, right? If only I could replicate that without the costume...
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:aimee=confident,Sorry Aimee! Style dominates low class "sexiness!"
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:akko,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=excited,...and you're the Witch that put on that magic show by the Arc d'Triomphe, oui? <i>C'est un monde petit!</i>
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:akko,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=wink,From one magical girl to another, I suppose you enjoyed that, huh, Akko?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:amalia=wink,Nope! No posessions or voodoo here, Amalia! I'm supposed to stop that kinda stuff!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:beatrix=confident,I-I didn't come here to-- there's mo sany membarrassed-- s-so many embarrassed people! I'm brave for just being here, and I'm not going to quit, Beatrix!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:buffy=embarrassed,O-oh. Well, that is one way of looking at it, Buffy.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:buffy=confident,Buffy! Magic can be very useful. Usually. Most of the time?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:cammy=wink,Don't worry, Cammy! I'll have my powers back in a second. Plus, you're keeping everyone safe, so no reason to worry!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:chun-li=excited,Thanks, Chun-Li. I'm glad you can keep that a secret. And you know, that you'd think someone like me would be interesting!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=confident,Oh! You have a technique to transform too, Corrin?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=wink,Happy you can appreciate it, Corrin! I would love to do some training with you!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:d.va=bored,Er… D.Va, it’s magic. I think I’ve mentioned that a few times.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:d.va,alsoPlayingStage:3,marker:bodysuit=alarmed,Thanks for the offer to help, D.Va, but… Um. My bodysuit doesn’t come off like yours does. I don’t think anyway!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:d.va,saidMarker:d.va_competition=wink,I bet you’re really interested in the contents of my suit, D.Va, but you’ll have to try harder than that!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:daria=confused,Skinny? Er... well, I do run around a lot.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:daria=embarrassed,But you're pretty tiny yourself, Daria. I'm sust jurprised-- j-just surprised that's what you chose to pick up on!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:elaine,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=embarrassed,<i>V-voudou?</i> I know they speak French in the Caribbean but I've never done black magic!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=embarrassed,I-I mean it's not much of a secret anymore, Elizabeth! T-though I do hope I win the next hand, too.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:florina=excited,O-oh. Nope, just a cute girl. W-wait, did you just...I...Oh my! I think you’re cute too! Er. You know, as friends. (Marinette, get a grip!)
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:persona_mari=excited,Trickster? Tikki can be kind of minxy, but... Oh! Do you call your kwami Personas?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:sentai_mari=embarrassed,W-well, I wish I could constantly get new powerups like those shows, but aren't those more for boys?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:0-1,priority:150,marker:gwencrush=embarrassed,Thanks, Spider-Woman! I like to put a lot of m-myself into my style. (<i>Pourquoi est-ce que je m’enerve tellement autour de Spider-Woman?</i>)

2-stripped,alsoPlaying:jenetta=embarrassed,O-oh! Well, thank you Jenetta. I bet you look nice under your costume too! Um. Y-you're nevermind.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:jin,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=wink,It sounds like your friend doesn't have much endurance. I bet you'd last a little longer, huh?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:jin,alsoPlayingStage:5-9=embarrassed,I mean, I'd have to touch you to be certain. N-not that I'd want to! Or that we're allowed to!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura=confused,Hm? Oh, yeah, my magic just ran out. My guardian spirit needs a little time to recharge, that's all, Jura.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura=embarrassed,Nuclear? You seem awfully scared by this "Paksis" guy. Is he some kind of super villain?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:juri,alsoPlayingStage:2=confused,And yet it somehow looks more put together than your outfit, Juri...
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:kimberly,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=wink,W-well, I'm glad you enjoyed the show! I did detransform, but no, I don't have a... how'd you say <i>Zord</i>?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:kira=alarmed,How else was I supposed to do it, Kira?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:kyoko,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=embarrassed,E-er, what were you expecting, exactly, Kyoko?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:kyoko,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=embarrassed,Um-- Kyoko, what exactly were you expecting of me, then?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:kyoko,alsoPlayingStage:5-10=alarmed,To be fair, Kyoko... Um. I hope it's... More pleasant than what you had to reveal...
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:kyoko,alsoPlayingStage:5-10=alarmed,Um. I hope this was pretty distracting considering your... Condition.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=embarrassed,Oh! Sorry Kyu. It’s just how my costume works!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:5-8=confused,Well, unlike you, my magic isn’t a slow fade like that.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:mahiru=confident,Sorry about your picture Mahiru, but this kind of thing is best kept pretty secret, you know?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:mahiru=embarrassed,W-well, Mahiru, I don't think having a secret identity is that useful if everyone knows what it is!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:mei=wink,Well thank you Mei! You think they'd give away my identity a bit more, but I'm happy you like that icy blue color.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:mei=excited,That's sweet, Mei! But I bet the sky in Antarctica was a much prettier blue!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia=confident,I don’t know much about what sort of heroes are from where you’re from, but yes, I’m a superhero! I protect the innocent from harm and save those who get possessed by evil.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:misato=wink,A plug suit? Oh, of course not! It's just higher dimensional folding thanks to the alien spirit who comes around with me.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:misato=embarrassed,<i>P-plug?</i> I am a <i>lady</i> and I do <i>not</i> use plugs on my body.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:morrigan=confident,<i>Yes,</i> this is my secret identity, Morrigan. But I'm far from being out!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:morrigan=confused,Y-you <i>promise</i>? Well, um. Thanks for not telling anyone about this, Morrigan.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:0=wink,Thanks Nagisa! And yes, I can change into and out of my costume just about wherever, so I always make sure to dress well.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:1=excited,Aww, Nagisa, that’s so sweet. I’m really happy someone appreciates the work I put into it!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:-1=bored,Nagisa, I came here to save people from being embarrassed. The magic is... kind of part of all that. I’m sorry.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:2=excited,Aww, Nagisa, that’s so sweet. I’m really happy someone appreciates the work I put into it!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:3=confident,It’s always nice to see things in person, rather than TV. W-well, when it’s something cool, anyway, don’t you think Nagisa?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:-3=embarrassed,Don’t worry Nagisa. Even if this doesn’t go your way, we can always do something a bit more wholesome after
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:4=embarrassed,H-ha, thanks Nagisa. I hope you mean at the transformation sequence and not the stripping.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:5=confused,U-uhm. Magic and careful planning, mostly, Nagisa.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:6=wink,Never give up Nagisa! I meant it when I said I’d protect you, after all.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:7=wink,Never give up Nagisa! I meant it when I said I’d protect you, after all.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:nagisa,alsoPlayingStage:7-9=embarrassed,Um… Sorry everyone! I promise I’m not cheating!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:natsuki=confident,Nope, Natsuki, just old fashioned Chinese magic.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:navi,alsoPlayingStage:1-5=confident,I wouldn't say I'm very princess-like. I'm just a normal girl, with a normal life. Mostly.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan=wink,Sorry Nugi-chan. I'm a lady! And a lady always wears panties. Er. At least panties.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan=confident,I think I'm flattered, Nugi-chan!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan,alsoPlayingStage:8=embarrassed,E-er, sorry, Nugi-chan, it’ll be at least five minutes... (And I think people would get mad if I put my costume back on.)
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:palutena=embarrassed,Do you get confused often, Palutena?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:palutena=alarmed,D-don't you have the ability to grant this type of magic to your followers, Palutena? Is it really that weird?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:pearl=bored,It's not a trick at all! I... Use luck and insight, Pearl!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:pearl=confused,I-I see some human social nuance is lost on you, Pearl.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=embarrassed,Tikki gets tired if I stay in costume for too long. I had some other stuff I took care of before I got here, Pit.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:3-7=wink,Depending on the circumstances, I can be a <i>lot</i> more than just two stages, Pit.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:revy=confused,I'm glad you're somewhat surprised, but do you need to be so vulgar, Revy?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:ryuji,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=wink,I'm not <i>quite</i> sure what the Phantom Thieves do, but changing hearts sounds very similar to what I do!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:ryuji,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=wink,I don't have a Persona, but I <i>do</i> have a Kwami. I think they're similar!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:samus,alsoPlayingStage:0-2=embarrassed,F-fun? L-like what, Samus?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:samus,alsoPlayingStage:3-7=wink,I appreciate the compliment, Samus. Maybe you should suit back up and I'll give it a go?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:sei=embarrassed,Um. It’s magic, Sei. You’ll have to trust me on that.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:shimakaze=confident,A remodel? Hmm... that's one way of looking at it. If it weren't against the rules, I'd be ready to retransform in about five or six minutes!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=bored,I guess I have to hope I can make my Lucky Charm erase the footage after this…
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:twilight=wink,Well, Tikki is the kwami that watches over creation... so with Cat Noir, I think we kind of represent harmony, Twilight!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:videl=embarrassed,H-hey! At least I don't dress like I'm at a sleepover, Videl!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:videl=confused,I <i>like</i> my costume, Videl. Maybe you'll find a reason to wear one someday. I think green and orange would be a good fit.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:vriska,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:4a=wink,They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Thanks for paying homage to the <i>real</i> original, Vriska.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:vriska,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:4a=embarrassed,I haven't stolen anything from you. I've been at this for quite a while, Vriska.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:vriska,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:4a=wink,They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Thanks for paying homage to the <i>real</i> original, Vriska.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:vriska,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:4a=wink,Impressive talk, for someone who's already copied me.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:vriska,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:4a=wink,I know someone <i>else</i> who puts up a big tough act to hide her feelings.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=wink,I think my costume is better for training, and it reduces how much pain I feel. I hope I'm still up to your fitness standards, Trainer!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:wiifitfemale=confident,Whew. It's always a relief to be out of my costume.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:zizou=confused,I can only stay transformed for so long… Tikki gets a little tired. She'll be fine soon, but I don't think people would be happy with me putting my suit back on.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=alarmed,Mine are NOT demonic!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=confused,I-I don’t think anyone wants demonic powers here. I <i>fight</i> akuma, after all.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,count-palutena:1=confident,Palutena, have you ever considered giving Pit a costume? I bet he'd look very handsome. (And wouldn't be at all like Cat Noir. A girl can dream, can't she?)
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,count-pit:1=embarrassed,Er, well, I guess we'll see if her video keeps, won't we, Pit?

2-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=7,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_identity1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_identity1=calm,Um. Well, Ladybug is my hero identity. I don’t need a license, I just kind of… do it?
2-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=7,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_lucky1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_lucky1=wink,Well, stayed tuned, chat. You'll see when I win!

2-must_strip_winning,consecutiveLosses:3=embarrassed,W-well, even if I’m ahead, this is a bad turn of events.
2-must_strip_winning,consecutiveLosses:3=embarrassed,W-well, even if I’m ahead, this is a <i>Miraculously</i> bad turn of events.

2-must_strip_winning,consecutiveLosses:3=alarmed,W-wait, this can’t be right, I’ve… Just gone twice… But a third time? This isn’t a charm! This isn’t a charm at all!

2-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_suit1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_suit2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_suit2=stripping,It's a bit like… you know that springy feeling you get in spandex, but the safe, comfy feeling of an old sweater?
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:uravity=stripping,Oh! I wasn’t born with my Miraculous. It’s a magical artifact with a spirit guide called a Kwami! Her name is Tikki…
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:vriska,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:4a=stripping,The only lesson I'm learning is that you're a sore winner, Vriska.

2-stripping,alsoPlaying:vriska,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:4a=stripping,You know, Vriska, you copied <i>my</i> costume way before I got to this point.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:vriska,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:4a=stripping,If I want to show off a dozen outfits in a single game I'm attending to help people, by using magic, I'll tell you, Vriska.

2-stripping,saidMarker:loss2_stage2=stripping,Er. My costume, and my jacket? You really play for keeps, guys. And girls. Who are staring at me. I really need to break this streak...
2-stripping,saidMarker:loss2_stage2=stripping,Um. At least you didn’t get my yo-yo, costume, and jacket in one streak. I think that’s just...weirdly bad luck on my part.

3-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s=embarrassed,Uh, 9S, I’m not exactly stupid, but you’re being really vague for someone who’s supposed to clarify data. I’m curious to understand what you mean though. (And something distracting would certainly be nice about now.)
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:d.va=wink,I hadn’t thought of it that way, but that seems about right, Hana. Sometimes a purse just isn’t enough space, you know?
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:d.va,saidMarker:d.va_competition=embarrassed,You seem really invested in the theory I’m usually naked under my suit, D.Va. Are you? U-um, for curious minds?
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:futaba=wink,Oh! <i>Inari!</i> Yusuke Kitagawa is a huge inspiration. His portraits are so surreal! He must be super nice in Person!

3-stripped,alsoPlaying:morrigan=wink,Pfft. What were you expecting, honestly, Morrigan?
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:morrigan=wink,Seriously? Were you expecting that I was just going to take off my pants without shoes first?
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:navi,alsoPlayingStage:1-5=wink,Well, to each their own. Maybe I have some tactics you aren't quite prepared for just yet!
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,saidMarker:loss2_stage2=bored,(<i>Pourriez-vous putain pais, Pit?</i>)
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:sayaka=confident,Oh! Yeah! My Miraculous is my earrings. I think that's pretty similar to what you're talking about!
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:shimakaze=excited,Oh, would you <i>really</i>? That would be lovely, Shimakaze!
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:shimakaze=confident,Well, I never pass up a design challenge, Shimakaze! That sounds like a tice nakeaway... nice takeaway... um, from a game like this.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_akko2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_akko3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_akko3=wink,…It’s so weird to think we’re getting undressed and just talking about this, though. I must feel really comfortable with you!

3-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_chat2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_chat3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_chat3=wink,Like I said, it’s complicated. I’m not really interested in getting into it, except that we’re both very comfortable with each other, and others.

3-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_criminals2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_criminals3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_criminals3=calm,I really do think most people are good at heart. And I’d rather hope for the best and try to comfort people in moments of weakness, because there’s more of those than truly wicked people deserving of punishment.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_day2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_day3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_day3=calm,Unless there’s interruptions, of course. Yikes, twelve hour days? I guess with your camera, it’s not like you really get time off… Sorry, Str-- Nicole.

3-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_identity2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_identity3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_identity3=wink,I’m French. Being rude to <i>débiles comme toi</i> comes naturally. Huh?
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_lucky2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_lucky3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_lucky3=confident,It's going to undo all this embarrassing nonsense. When I win. O-of course.

3-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_reveal2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_reveal3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_reveal3=bored,<i>Sigh</i>. I’m not a stranger to that concept. The Ladyblog’s gotten a lot better about this but… it can be kind of schlocky. Sorry Alya.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_stress2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_stress3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_stress3=calm,I think you can face problems without angsting about them. Too much, anyway. Emotive control is important.

3-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity=excited,And she’s clearly a prankster, bringing me to a game like this… Well… I’d like to think Tikki’s a little light in my life!
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:vriska,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:4a=wink,I think I'd look to see who's had to use her magic more to see who's in need of a lesson in restraint, Vriska.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:vriska,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:4a=wink,Oh, <i>I'm</i> cheating when you've copied my outfit? When <i>you've</i> lost more hands? I must be cheating a <i>lot</i>, huh?
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:vriska,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:4a=stripped,You're so bent out of shape over this, Vriska.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:vriska,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:4a=wink,I'm not a cheater. I can play by the rules, Vriska. That's more than I think can be said about you.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,count-gwen:1=wink,Aww, Pit. You don't need to feel left out! You already have someone beautiful in your life, don't you?
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:futaba,count-ryuji:1=confident,Oh! You mean <i>Inari</i>? Of course! And Ryuji, I bet! Most artists are a little strange. Er... not that I'm weird. I'm not weird... am I weird?

3-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers<7,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_hero1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_hero1=confident,Well, I’m a superhero <i>when</i> I’m Ladybug. It’s more than just a mask, it’s a mindset too!

3-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=7,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_suit1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_suit1=embarrassed,Oh? Yeah! It's magic, and made of really flexible, durable stuff.
3-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_akko1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_akko1,count-akko:1=confident,Well, I think our magic works a little differently…? Most of my power comes from just having good rapport with TIkki.

4-must_strip_losing,consecutiveLosses:2,saidMarker:twiceloss,marker:loss2_stage4=alarmed,Huh? Again? Already? I thought I was playing better…
4-must_strip_losing,consecutiveLosses:3=embarrassed,W-Wow, ~player~, I’m lucky this is just a game. I’d have been...In way worse shape if this were a fight…
4-must_strip_losing,consecutiveLosses:3=embarrassed,W-well, even if I was ahead, this is a <i>Miraculously</i> bad turn of events.
4-must_strip_losing,consecutiveLosses:3=confident,So much and so fast...Normally I don't even undress this quickly for...um...You know.
4-must_strip_losing,consecutiveLosses:3=alarmed,W-wait, this can’t be right, I’ve… Just gone twice… But a third time? This isn’t a charm! This isn’t a charm at all!
4-stripping=stripping,I’m really not used to changing in front of others. Really, in any sense of the word.
4-stripping=stripping,I don't know if this is more or less embarassing than losing my costume.
4-stripping=stripping,C-could you stare less? I-it's not like I was checking out the others.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:9s=stripping,9S, Tikki’s not a robot, if that’s what you’re asking! She’s a kwami, a magical spirit tied to the Miraculous.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:daria=stripping,Oh! Don't be that way, Daria! Clothes can be so fun and... well, even magical! It's a way you express yourself, oui?
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:futaba=stripping,It helps me find tools I need in order to win fights against the bad guys, Futaba!
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=stripping,Whoa, really? A shirt signed by Spider-Woman, of one of my favorite bands? N-not that I’m not having fun here, but having a souvenir that’s… Fun rather than just embarrassing would be nice!
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:2-8=stripping,Whoa, really? N-not that I’m not having fun here, but having a souvenir that’s… Fun rather than just embarrassing would be nice, Gwen!
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura=stripping,Hmm... more French, Jura...? Okay... how about... <i>tu es jolie!</i>
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:morrigan=stripping,You know, you <i>could</i> just be nice, Morrigan-- Y-you know. I would <i>strongly</i> have preferred never ever to have considered that.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:morrigan=stripping,E-erk. L-let's pretend Morrigan didn't say that.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:morrigan=stripping,Part of me wants to believe they'd be more surprised by the superhero thing than this. I-er, I mean, um!
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=stripping,Oh! Well, thank you, Pit. That makes me feel a lot better... But um. Okay, I'm just going to pull this off...
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:shimakaze=stripping,Huh. I haven't ever really thought about it! Usually Akumatized villains are kind of obvious... I've never thought about what to do if they were hiding around...
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_akko1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_akko2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_akko2=stripping,Lucky Charm isn’t the <i>exact</i> incantation, but I’m sure Tikki would love to talk to you after the game…

4-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_camera1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_camera2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_camera2=stripping,But it’s not latex. It’s magic, but… um… I’ve worn similar things.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_chat1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_chat2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_chat2=stripping,My relationship with Adri-- <i>Cat Noir</i> is complicated, but um. Yes, we <i>are</i> together.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_cigs1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_cigs2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_cigs2=stripping,No? I eat as much as I want to fill up. I’m kind of amazed my metabolism is so good, to be honest… it’s hard being a baker’s daughter!
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_criminals1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_criminals2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_criminals2=stripping,Well, I usually turn those types over to the police… can we talk about something else? I’ve seen my share of people being horrible to each other but…
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_day1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_day2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_day2=stripping,Okay… Nicole… <i>gah</i> I’ve been considering you like you’ve been akumatized this whole time, it’s so weird to just call you Nicole--  I get up around six, head to class, work until sundown, then go out on patrol.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_discomfort1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_discomfort2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_discomfort2=stripping,Like you’re doing now.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_fashion1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_fashion2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_fashion2=stripping,Oh! I’m really into flared stuff lately. I feel like stuff that can be tight near the joints but flowing at the ends looks so elegant! Obviously, though, I like frilly things.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_hero1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_hero2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_hero2=stripping,I’d say it’s not very different, I have magic and super strength to help me out. Really, it’s other heroes that are braver than me.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_identity1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_identity2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_identity2=stripping,To me, it seems as though you’d have a better time if you just focused on simple ways of helping people.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_lucky1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_lucky2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_lucky2=stripping,N-no! It's sot the next oy-- not a sex toy! It's my finishing move!
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_mulan1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_mulan2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_mulan2=stripping,Er… I suppose that’s true… we seem to have a shared heritage, at least.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_paris1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_paris2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_paris2=stripping,--I love visiting all the art museums and cultural centers, the coffee and food <i>everywhere</i> are excellent, and then there’s just the stuff everyone loves: movies, games, drinks with friends--
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_reveal1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_reveal2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_reveal2=stripping,<i>Zut</i>, nope! This is not the time for this!
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_stress1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_stress2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_stress2=stripping,I don't appreciate where you're going with this…
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_suit1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_suit2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_suit2=stripping,It's a bit like… you know that springy feeling you get in spandex, but the safe, comfy feeling of an old sweater?
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:zizou=stripping,I took off a whole costume! It doesn't get any bigger, Zizou!
4-stripping,saidMarker:loss2_stage4=stripping,What is it Americans say...No shoot, no shars, no service? Ack, no shirt, no shoes, no service! (Focus, Marinette!)
4-stripping,saidMarker:loss2_stage4=stripping,This is suspicious...I normally don’t just lose twice in a row.

5-stripped=stripped,W-well. I hope you like what you see! Because I do! I mean. In the mirror, in the mornings. (Marinette stop talking.)
5-stripped=stripped,W-well. I guess this is the strip part of the game! A-as opposed to the p-poke. N-not that... (Marinette stop talking.)
5-stripped=stripped,W-well. I like patterns. And since I wear my costume so much, having other stuff... Uhm. (Marinette stop talking.)
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s=stripped,Um. She has a soul, I don’t think she is a soul… (I really hope this boy’s tangents keep going…)
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:daria=stripped,O-okay, true. They do tend to work better when you wear them...
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:daria=confident,Well, sometimes, there's fun in taking <i>off</i> clothes. Sometimes, anyway.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:gwen=confident,I’m warming up to <i>lots</i> of ideas, Gwen.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:jin=wink,Would you say you have that <i>side</i> effect on people? <i>Oh my god, when did I start punning!?</i>
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura=stripped,That was very close, Jura! You should kind of roll your R's more. Sorta like if you need to clean chocolate out from the top of your mouth!
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:moon=embarrassed,I guess we should follow the rules, Moon.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:morrigan=confused,Well. I'm beyond weirded out by Morrigan at this point.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:natsuki=stripped,H-huh? W-what was that, Natsuki?
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:palutena=confident,Ah, someone who appreciates a nice exchange with an opponent without puns. You’re wicked pretty--Pretty witty, I mean! Not wicked at all.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=stripped,W-well, if you like awkward, stuttering art students and superheroes, I-I might know someone who'd be a good fit! (He is pretty brave...)
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:shimakaze=excited,I'll have to talk to you more about your fairies. I'm sure Tikki would have a lot to say!
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_akko2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_akko3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_akko3=wink,…It’s so weird to think we’re getting undressed and just talking about this, though. I must feel really comfortable with you!
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_bondage2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_bondage3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_bondage3=alarmed,…I-I don’t want to service you like that-- I mean, I wouldn’t want to-- y-you know!
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_camera2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_camera3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_camera3=embarrassed,W-well, c-could we tot nalk--not talk about this?
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_chat2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_chat3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_chat3=wink,Like I said, it’s complicated. I’m not really interested in getting into it, except that we’re both very comfortable with each other, and others.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_cigs2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_cigs3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_cigs3=bored,I’ve never, will never, and won’t ever do anything like that just for my career.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_criminals2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_criminals3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_criminals3=calm,I really do think most people are good at heart. And I’d rather hope for the best and try to comfort people in moments of weakness, because there’s more of those than truly wicked people deserving of punishment.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_day2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_day3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_day3=calm,Unless there’s interruptions, of course. Yikes, twelve hour days? I guess with your camera, it’s not like you really get time off… Sorry, Str-- Nicole.

5-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_fashion2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_fashion3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_fashion3=alarmed,Um. I-I’ve about it thought--th-thought about it!
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_hero2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_hero3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_hero3=bored,E-er. I’m not sure that’s such a great accomplishment.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_identity2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_identity3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_identity3=wink,I’m French. Being rude to <i>débiles comme toi</i> comes naturally. Huh?
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_lucky2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_lucky3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_lucky3=confident,It's going to undo all this embarrassing nonsense. When I win. O-of course.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_mulan2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_mulan3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_mulan3=embarrassed,I’m going to be so self conscious about this, now.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_paris2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_paris3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_paris3=embarrassed,--Er… I just love my city!
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_reveal2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_reveal3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_reveal3=bored,<i>Sigh</i>. I’m not a stranger to that concept. The Ladyblog’s gotten a lot better about this but… it can be kind of schlocky. Sorry Alya.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_stress2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_stress3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_stress3=calm,I think you can face problems without angsting about them. Too much, anyway. Emotive control is important.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_suit2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_suit3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_suit3=embarrassed,It's a bit tike lat--l-like that! Um… sure, Streaming-chan, your answer's…
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:twilight,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:twilight_marinette_akumas,notSaidMarker:twilight_akuma,marker:twilight_akuma=stripped,Well, Twilight, akuma are butterflies that posess people's objects of significance when they're feeling strong negative emotions. This turns them evil, and gives them dark superpowers! It's my job to stop them!
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:zizou=stripped,Don't get too overconfident, Zizou. I may not have my lucky charm but I do have a few tricks left!
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:zizou,totalMales:0-1,marker:jilling=confused,Excuse me? Isn't the term Jilling for ladies, Zizou?
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:zizou,totalMales:1-3=alarmed,U-uhm, I didn’t think I'd have to do <i>that</i> if I lost! Just… You know, play with myself! Zizou, did you trick Tikki?!
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,marker:zoneproposition=confident,Zone-tan, that was actually very good! Your dialect sounds tres Quebecois! I think hearing my own language makes this a lot less embarrassing.
5-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers<7,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_bondage1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_bondage1=wink,You’d be surprised how rarely my <i>Chat</i> has that problem.

5-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers<7,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_criminals1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_criminals1=confident,Well, a little bit. Paris’s gotten really peaceful since I became a hero, though!
5-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers<7,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_day1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_day1=confused,Yeah…? Are you sure about that, Streaming-chan?
5-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers<7,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_hero1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_hero1=confident,Well, I’m a superhero <i>when</i> I’m Ladybug. It’s more than just a mask, it’s a mindset too!
5-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers<7,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_paris1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_paris1=excited,Oh, there’s so much! I couldn’t possibly--
5-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=7,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_camera1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_camera1=confused,<i>Sigh</i>. No. I’m not even that worried about rewinding time at the end of this…
5-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=7,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_discomfort1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_discomfort1=confused,Me? I don’t appreciate it when people manipulate others.
5-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=7,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_fashion1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_fashion1=embarrassed,Well, I’m trying to be one. I still take classes…
5-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=7,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_identity1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_identity1=calm,Um. Well, Ladybug is my hero identity. I don’t need a license, I just kind of… do it?
5-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=7,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_lucky1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_lucky1=wink,Well, stayed tuned, chat. You'll see when I win!
5-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=7,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_stress1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_stress1=confused,Ah, <i>oui</i>...?
5-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=7,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_suit1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_suit1=embarrassed,Oh? Yeah! It's magic, and made of really flexible, durable stuff.
5-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_akko1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_akko1,count-akko:1=confident,Well, I think our magic works a little differently…? Most of my power comes from just having good rapport with TIkki.
5-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_mulan1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_mulan1,count-mulan:1=confident,Yeah? What’s that? We all have some sort of important trinket--
5-must_strip_winning=must_strip,Well, I guess you caught me with my pants down.

5-must_strip_winning=must_strip,I-I guess at this point I have to lose a bit too.
5-must_strip_winning,consecutiveLosses:2,alsoPlaying:ann,saidMarker:twiceloss,marker:loss2_stage5=alarmed,Two in a row <i>again</i>? I’m getting streaks of luck. Bad streaks. I can’t help but wonder if a certain black cat is involved…Er, I don’t mean your pet, Mona, Ann.

5-must_strip_winning,consecutiveLosses:2,saidMarker:twiceloss,marker:twiceloss2=alarmed,Huh? Again? Already? I thought I was playing better… But I guess I’m so far ahead, I really don’t mind.
5-must_strip_winning,consecutiveLosses:3=embarrassed,W-well, even if I’m ahead, this is a bad turn of events.
5-must_strip_winning,consecutiveLosses:3=embarrassed,W-well, even if I’m ahead, this is a <i>Miraculously</i> bad turn of events.

5-stripping,alsoPlaying:d.va,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:d.va_noobs=embarrassed,I-I don’t really need help, D.Va, b-but if you really wanted…
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:d.va,alsoPlayingStage:3,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:d.va_noobs=confused,It’s okay, D.Va. I have enough skill at undressing myself. Thanks.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:daria=stripping,I-I like polka dots! B-but not everything of mine is Ladybug themed! That'd just be silly!
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:crash,marker:pegasusquish=stripping,Wait, Florina, THAT WAS YOU?
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:0-1=stripping,Uh, is that a euphemism, Gwen, or are you just taunting me?
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:2-8=stripping,Uh, is that a euphemism, Spider-Woman, or are you just taunting me?
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:jura=stripping,I'm flattered you're so interested in my mother tongue! <i>V-voulez vous de lecons privee?</i>
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:morrigan,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=stripping,I'm a little behind, but I'm far from done, Morrigan!
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:morrigan,alsoPlayingStage:5-8=stripping,And yet, I'm somehow still ahead of you, Morrigan... What I wouldn't give for my yo-yo right about now...
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=stripping,O-oh! Well, thank you! They're very comfortable and cute. Um. Do you think I'm comfortable--I mean, cute?
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_akko1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_akko2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_akko2=stripping,Lucky Charm isn’t the <i>exact</i> incantation, but I’m sure Tikki would love to talk to you after the game…

5-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_camera1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_camera2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_camera2=stripping,But it’s not latex. It’s magic, but… um… I’ve worn similar things.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_chat1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_chat2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_chat2=stripping,My relationship with Adri-- <i>Cat Noir</i> is complicated, but um. Yes, we <i>are</i> together.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_cigs1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_cigs2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_cigs2=stripping,No? I eat as much as I want to fill up. I’m kind of amazed my metabolism is so good, to be honest… it’s hard being a baker’s daughter!
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_criminals1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_criminals2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_criminals2=stripping,Well, I usually turn those types over to the police… can we talk about something else? I’ve seen my share of people being horrible to each other but…

5-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_discomfort1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_discomfort2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_discomfort2=stripping,Like you’re doing now.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_fashion1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_fashion2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_fashion2=stripping,Oh! I’m really into flared stuff lately. I feel like stuff that can be tight near the joints but flowing at the ends looks so elegant! Obviously, though, I like frilly things.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_hero1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_hero2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_hero2=stripping,I’d say it’s not very different, I have magic and super strength to help me out. Really, it’s other heroes that are braver than me.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_identity1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_identity2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_identity2=stripping,To me, it seems as though you’d have a better time if you just focused on simple ways of helping people.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_lucky1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_lucky2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_lucky2=stripping,N-no! It's sot the next oy-- not a sex toy! It's my finishing move!
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_mulan1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_mulan2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_mulan2=stripping,Er… I suppose that’s true… we seem to have a shared heritage, at least.
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_paris1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_paris2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_paris2=stripping,--I love visiting all the art museums and cultural centers, the coffee and food <i>everywhere</i> are excellent, and then there’s just the stuff everyone loves: movies, games, drinks with friends--
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_reveal1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_reveal2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_reveal2=stripping,<i>Zut</i>, nope! This is not the time for this!
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_stress1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_stress2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_stress2=stripping,I don't appreciate where you're going with this…
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_suit1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_suit2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_suit2=stripping,It's a bit like… you know that springy feeling you get in spandex, but the safe, comfy feeling of an old sweater?
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:zizou=stripping,Well thanks Zizou! I think they're cute too. You’re almost making me not self conscious!
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=stripping,Oh, oui, Zone?
5-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit,count-gwen:1=stripping,Wait, are you and Palutena not... Involved, Pit?
5-stripping,saidMarker:loss2_stage5=stripping,Well, I don’t usually like just wearing a bra and pants. So this got...comfortable quickly.
5-stripping,saidMarker:loss2_stage5=stripping,U-uhm, was the bra that appealing? Jokes about secret identities aside, did you want to see if they’d match?


#losing bra
6-stripped=stripped,Cat Noir’s humor must be really rubbing off on me. Like he tries to.
6-stripped=stripped,Well... I hope everyone gets to enjoy some style I usually don’t share.
6-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s=wink,Oh, there’s quite a few <i>Miraculouses</i>. The Ladybug Miraculous and Cat Miraculous are the two most powerful though.
6-stripped,alsoPlaying:d.va=wink,Zenyatta? That robot monk? I’ve only had to fight one Akumatized robot… But Zenyatta seems a lot more focused and therefore a lot less scary! I’d love to learn more about him!
6-stripped,alsoPlaying:daria=alarmed,A-ah! N-no, please don't! Don't do that!
6-stripped,alsoPlaying:elaine,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=stripped,They match in color, Elaine! Most of my underwear does, if I'm being honest... Erk.
6-stripped,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=confident,You know, when I was in high school, other girls never asked me to dance. Maybe I <i>should</i> broaden my horizons.
6-stripped,alsoPlaying:gwen,alsoPlayingStage:4-8=wink,G-gorgeous? <i>Oh, arrete, toi.</i> Hehe, <i>Gwen, je vais devoir commencer a te parler sale si tu ne fais pas attention.</i>
6-stripped,alsoPlaying:joey,alsoPlayingStage:3-8=wink,Sure, Joey! But learning to use a Miraculous is a really long process! If you're ever in Paris, I'd be happy to talk more about it.
6-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura=excited,That's "would you like private lessons," and I'd love to have an excuse to tour a space ship!
6-stripped,alsoPlaying:korra=embarrassed,Can you help another lady hero get over her shame?
6-stripped,alsoPlaying:morrigan,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=stripped,U-underwear model? N-no, not thanks you. No thank you!
6-stripped,alsoPlaying:morrigan,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=stripped,M-maybe if you said <i>underworld</i> model, I could match your tastes, Morrigan!
6-stripped,alsoPlaying:morrigan,alsoPlayingStage:5-8=wink,You know, I've put <i>serious</i> thought into costume friendly underwear lines. Maybe <i>you</i> could model them, Morrigan!
6-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_akko2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_akko3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_akko3=wink,…It’s so weird to think we’re getting undressed and just talking about this, though. I must feel really comfortable with you!
6-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_bondage2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_bondage3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_bondage3=alarmed,…I-I don’t want to service you like that-- I mean, I wouldn’t want to-- y-you know!
6-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_camera2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_camera3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_camera3=embarrassed,W-well, c-could we tot nalk--not talk about this?
6-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_chat2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_chat3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_chat3=wink,Like I said, it’s complicated. I’m not really interested in getting into it, except that we’re both very comfortable with each other, and others.
6-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_cigs2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_cigs3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_cigs3=bored,I’ve never, will never, and won’t ever do anything like that just for my career.
6-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_criminals2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_criminals3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_criminals3=calm,I really do think most people are good at heart. And I’d rather hope for the best and try to comfort people in moments of weakness, because there’s more of those than truly wicked people deserving of punishment.
6-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_day2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_day3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_day3=calm,Unless there’s interruptions, of course. Yikes, twelve hour days? I guess with your camera, it’s not like you really get time off… Sorry, Str-- Nicole.
6-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_discomfort2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_discomfort3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_discomfort3=bored,<i>Non mais allo quoi?</i>
6-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_fashion2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_fashion3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_fashion3=alarmed,Um. I-I’ve about it thought--th-thought about it!
6-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_hero2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_hero3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_hero3=bored,E-er. I’m not sure that’s such a great accomplishment.
6-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_identity2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_identity3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_identity3=wink,I’m French. Being rude to <i>débiles comme toi</i> comes naturally. Huh?
6-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_lucky2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_lucky3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_lucky3=confident,It's going to undo all this embarrassing nonsense. When I win. O-of course.
6-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_mulan2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_mulan3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_mulan3=embarrassed,I’m going to be so self conscious about this, now.
6-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_paris2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_paris3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_paris3=embarrassed,--Er… I just love my city!
6-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_reveal2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_reveal3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_reveal3=bored,<i>Sigh</i>. I’m not a stranger to that concept. The Ladyblog’s gotten a lot better about this but… it can be kind of schlocky. Sorry Alya.
6-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_stress2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_stress3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_stress3=calm,I think you can face problems without angsting about them. Too much, anyway. Emotive control is important.
6-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_suit2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_suit3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_suit3=embarrassed,It's a bit tike lat--l-like that! Um… sure, Streaming-chan, your answer's…
6-stripped,alsoPlaying:twilight,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:twilight_marinette_akumas,notSaidMarker:twilight_akuma,marker:twilight_akuma=stripped,Well, Twilight, akuma are butterflies that posess people's objects of significance when they're feeling strong negative emotions. This turns them evil, and gives them dark superpowers! It's my job to stop them!
6-stripped,alsoPlaying:zizou=stripped,W-well, <i>avec Le Bon Marche,</i> something comfortably and cute but not exorbitant. I'm not really one for lingerie, surprisingly.
6-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,alsoPlayingStage:5,count-korra:1=wink,We could make a Pit sandwich, if you'd like, Pit. Would that make you feel better?
6-stripped,alsoPlaying:korra,count-pit:1=alarmed,Well, get naked, Pit, and then we'll have something to talk about. Um. Not out of pity, just... Anyway!

6-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers<7,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_hero1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_hero1=confident,Well, I’m a superhero <i>when</i> I’m Ladybug. It’s more than just a mask, it’s a mindset too!
6-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers<7,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_paris1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_paris1=excited,Oh, there’s so much! I couldn’t possibly--

6-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=7,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_discomfort1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_discomfort1=confused,Me? I don’t appreciate it when people manipulate others.
6-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=7,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_fashion1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_fashion1=embarrassed,Well, I’m trying to be one. I still take classes…
6-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=7,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_identity1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_identity1=calm,Um. Well, Ladybug is my hero identity. I don’t need a license, I just kind of… do it?
6-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=7,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_lucky1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_lucky1=wink,Well, stayed tuned, chat. You'll see when I win!

6-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=7,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_suit1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_suit1=embarrassed,Oh? Yeah! It's magic, and made of really flexible, durable stuff.
6-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_akko1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_akko1,count-akko:1=confident,Well, I think our magic works a little differently…? Most of my power comes from just having good rapport with TIkki.
6-must_strip,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_mulan1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_mulan1,count-mulan:1=confident,Yeah? What’s that? We all have some sort of important trinket--

7-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_discomfort1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_discomfort2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_discomfort2=stripping,Like you’re doing now.
7-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_fashion1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_fashion2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_fashion2=stripping,Oh! I’m really into flared stuff lately. I feel like stuff that can be tight near the joints but flowing at the ends looks so elegant! Obviously, though, I like frilly things.
7-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_hero1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_hero2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_hero2=stripping,I’d say it’s not very different, I have magic and super strength to help me out. Really, it’s other heroes that are braver than me.
7-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_identity1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_identity2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_identity2=stripping,To me, it seems as though you’d have a better time if you just focused on simple ways of helping people.
7-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_lucky1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_lucky2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_lucky2=stripping,N-no! It's sot the next oy-- not a sex toy! It's my finishing move!
7-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_mulan1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_mulan2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_mulan2=stripping,Er… I suppose that’s true… we seem to have a shared heritage, at least.
7-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_paris1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_paris2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_paris2=stripping,--I love visiting all the art museums and cultural centers, the coffee and food <i>everywhere</i> are excellent, and then there’s just the stuff everyone loves: movies, games, drinks with friends--

7-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_stress1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_stress2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_stress2=stripping,I don't appreciate where you're going with this…
7-stripping,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_suit1,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_suit2,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_suit2=stripping,It's a bit like… you know that springy feeling you get in spandex, but the safe, comfy feeling of an old sweater?
7-stripping,alsoPlaying:vriska,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:4a=stripping,Oh come <i>on</i>! I have to have a better streak of luck soon!
7-stripping,alsoPlaying:vriska,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:4a=stripping,I can't lose to <i>her</i>! I <i>won't</i> lose to her!

7-stripping,saidMarker:loss2_stage7=stripping,W-what? Just like that? You...Everyone is going to see my...Erk...


#naked
-3-stripped=stripped,Well, I’m half French and half Chinese... and I have blue hair and a red costume, is my body really so surprising?
-3-stripped=stripped,Well, this is what a superhero looks like in the nude!
-3-stripped=stripped,Looks like I have nothing left to hide, so I may as well go all in!
-3-stripped=stripped,Is… Is it weird I kind of find this hot?
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:buffy=embarrassed,Oh. Um. Well, Buffy, if you wanted to take me out to dinner first, I'd have been okay with that too.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:buffy=wink,I-I really appreciate you focusing more on my... lack of skill than appearance, Buffy!
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:corrin_m=confident,Um... well thank you, Corrin. I do like to keep up appearances... even when nobody's going to um... see it.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:daria=stripped,Well, yes. You're welcome to try French kissing them, Daria. I don't think that's what either of us really want, though.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:elaine,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=stripped,<i>Merci,</i> Elaine.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stripped,Oh stop, you're making me blush, Elizabeth! Which is, incidentally, oh, <i>arrete, tu me rends rouge.</i>
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:felicia=confident,Well, I don't really like the shaved look on myself-- um... er, or anyone else, Felicia.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:gwen,priority:990=shibari3,And… Oh… Why does it.... <i>Oh oui</i> feel so good to… Ah!
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:kyu=confused,I mean I could see you using your tongue for that but-- Yeah! Using your eyelashes seems... Eww...
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:morrigan=embarrassed,E-er. A lady--not to mention a ladybug--keeps some things to herself!
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:morrigan=stripped,I mean... I definitely prefer this look.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=alarmed,Hawk Moth is super dangerous, Pit! I wouldn't underestimate him, and he's got mind control powers!
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=confident,I'm glad you like what you see, Pit! It's a big confidence booster!
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:raven=stripped,It looks like it’s time to get really really really serious!
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:shimakaze=stripped,Tikki, um... Tikki is my spirit guide! My kwami. She's kind of like those fairies you've talked about, Shimakaze. She should be around here <i>somewhere</i>...
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:shimakaze=stripped,--even if she's not here right now... Do your fairies help you out, Shimakaze? Er... with things like this. Not like <i>help</i> help... er... (<i>Help</i>.)
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_akko2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_akko3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_akko3=wink,…It’s so weird to think we’re getting undressed and just talking about this, though. I must feel really comfortable with you!
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_bondage2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_bondage3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_bondage3=alarmed,…I-I don’t want to service you like that-- I mean, I wouldn’t want to-- y-you know!
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_camera2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_camera3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_camera3=embarrassed,W-well, c-could we tot nalk--not talk about this?
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_chat2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_chat3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_chat3=wink,Like I said, it’s complicated. I’m not really interested in getting into it, except that we’re both very comfortable with each other, and others.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_cigs2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_cigs3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_cigs3=bored,I’ve never, will never, and won’t ever do anything like that just for my career.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_criminals2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_criminals3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_criminals3=calm,I really do think most people are good at heart. And I’d rather hope for the best and try to comfort people in moments of weakness, because there’s more of those than truly wicked people deserving of punishment.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_day2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_day3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_day3=calm,Unless there’s interruptions, of course. Yikes, twelve hour days? I guess with your camera, it’s not like you really get time off… Sorry, Str-- Nicole.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_discomfort2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_discomfort3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_discomfort3=bored,<i>Non mais allo quoi?</i>
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_fashion2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_fashion3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_fashion3=alarmed,Um. I-I’ve about it thought--th-thought about it!
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_hero2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_hero3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_hero3=bored,E-er. I’m not sure that’s such a great accomplishment.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_identity2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_identity3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_identity3=wink,I’m French. Being rude to <i>débiles comme toi</i> comes naturally. Huh?
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_lucky2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_lucky3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_lucky3=confident,It's going to undo all this embarrassing nonsense. When I win. O-of course.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_mulan2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_mulan3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_mulan3=embarrassed,I’m going to be so self conscious about this, now.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_paris2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_paris3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_paris3=embarrassed,--Er… I just love my city!
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_reveal2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_reveal3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_reveal3=bored,<i>Sigh</i>. I’m not a stranger to that concept. The Ladyblog’s gotten a lot better about this but… it can be kind of schlocky. Sorry Alya.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_stress2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_stress3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_stress3=calm,I think you can face problems without angsting about them. Too much, anyway. Emotive control is important.
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:lb_suit2,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:lb_suit3,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:lb_suit3=embarrassed,It's a bit tike lat--l-like that! Um… sure, Streaming-chan, your answer's…
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:zizou=alarmed,Ladybottom? Gah! Please don't make this a thing!
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:zizou,saidMarker:blake_crush=embarrassed,Blake, is this what it feels like to get a lewd compliment on your butt? Or...Bellabooty?
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,saidMarker:bodysuit,notSaidMarker:bodysuitsolomarinette,count-palutena:1=alarmed,I-I wasn't-- I just, with magic-- Gah! I see <i>someone</i> doesn't mind a little hair, Pit! That's the silver lining, I guess? thought it's um... More blue?
-3-stripped,alsoPlaying:zizou,count-pit:1=bored,I'm speechless. I can't even... Um. I- <i>Ladybottom?</i> Please don't let Alya hear about that <i>ever</i>.




#OPPONENT MUST STRIP
#These lines are spoken when an opponent must strip, but the character does not yet know what they will take off.
#Writing different variations is important here, as these lines will be spoken about thirty times per game.
#The "human" versions of the lines will only be spoken if the human player is stripping.

0-male_must_strip,filter:catfolk=wink,Sorry, ~name~, I prefer a different kitty cat to you.
0-male_must_strip,filter:catfolk=wink,I like my kitty cats a bit more... Obnoxious and a lot less at a strip poker game, ~name~.
0-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:masked=confused,Did ~name~ also come here on a mission? This feels almost like a trap...
0-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:masked=wink,I guess those of us with secret identities should stick together, huh, ~name~? Um. Just not in an intimate way.
0-male_must_strip,targetStage:3,filter:mean=bored,You seem like a jerk, ~name~.
0-male_must_strip,filter:monster=excited,Pfft. Everyone knows <i>monsters</i> aren’t real. At least if we can get you to settle down, it shouldn’t be too hard to stop the akuma possessing you.

0-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:silent=calm,~name~, you don’t, or can’t, really talk much, right? I guess actions speak louder than words, though! I’m sure you have quite a voice regardless.
0-male_must_strip,filter:spirit=confident,Huh, do you happen to know Tikki, ~name~? She’s the kwami of my Miraculous, and a really great teacher. I kind of wish she hadn’t um. Informed me of this game, though.

0-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:wand=embarrassed,I sincerely hope that ~name~'s wand is for magic. Given how the rest of this is, I have my concerns.
0-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:wand=wink,Well, ~name~'s certainly spellbinding with that magic wand, wouldn't you say?
0-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=wink,Sorry ~name~, I'll just take that weapon off you!
0-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=embarrassed,Er, could you not use that weapon, ~name~?
0-male_must_strip,targetStage:0,filter:weapon=wink,My yo-yo is kind of a weapon, though it's defensive... so I hope you don't mind disarming <i>yourself</i> please!
0-male_must_strip,filter:winged=bored,Those wings are really cool, ~name~! Have you um. Considered flying out of here, though?
0-male_must_strip,target:9s,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:viewers>=4,alsoPlayingNotSaidMarker:9s_pod1,alsoPlayingSayingMarker:9s_pod1=excited,Oh! You have a little companion too?

0-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:3=wink,You’re going to hold onto your shield?
0-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:4=wink,Hmm. I wonder if you’re going to be a gentleman and take it all off?
0-male_must_strip,target:captain_america,targetStage:6=excited,Oh, Cap’s up again! I think I can speak for must of the ladies here that this is probably the best part of the game.

0-male_must_strip,target:jin,targetStage:5=embarrassed,I <i>always</i> get lucky--feel lucky! I am lucky! Er-- j-just lose the hand, Jin!

0-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:1=wink,Looks like you weren't wrong about just getting started, Pit!
0-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:2=calm,I think um. I like the rest of your outfit better. I'm glad you're taking off those sandals... At least you didn't wear them with socks!
0-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:3=wink,Oh! The best parts are still ahead, aren't they, Pit?
0-male_must_strip,target:pit,targetStage:4=confused,D-don't get so embarrassed Pit! I don't want to see a goddess's chosen get Akumatized. Stay happy!

0-female_must_strip,alsoPlaying:zizou,alsoPlayingStage:0,marker:magicalgirl=confused,Er...Zizou, how do you know her breasts are better? Can you use your sorcery to see through clothes?
0-female_must_strip,target:elaine,targetStage:4,count-cheater:1=embarrassed,I kind of agree, Elaine. It seems like people here are cheating! E-er, not you though. (Except maybe on your husband... which is weird...)
0-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:star,count-kyu:1=embarrassed,Trust me, Vriska. You'll want to get rid of the evil butterfly in your dice as soon as possible. Er. Not Star or Kyu though. What a crossover this is turning into.

6-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=confident,Ah, don’t worry Nagisa, we’ll see this through together!
6-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=confident,You’re worth lots, Nagisa. Don’t lose heart, everyone can enjoy time with friends!
6-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Are you in surry to hemove your rocks? Er. A hurry to remove your socks, Nagisa?
6-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:1,marker:nagisa_time_travel=calm,Hmm… Tarou Urashima… That’s the story about the time traveler… But why would that make you ahead…?
6-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=wink,No need to get worried, Nagisa! I’m right here with you. And friends make it better, right? Or...Um, more tolerable.
6-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=confident,It’s alright, Nagisa. I can definitely tell you’re playing better than last round!
6-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:shego=embarrassed,I-I may not have my clothes. But I’ll fight you any day, Shego, if it means protecting innocent people like Nagisa.
6-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:3=embarrassed,A dango bra? That would be like me wearing something with cinnamon rolls on it... Or cake? Given how this went, maybe I should’ve...
6-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:3=wink,Don’t give up Nagisa! You haven’t lost yet!
6-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:3=confident,Hmm...I don’t think anyone will laugh, Nagisa. And that’s a really clever idea!
6-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:4=embarrassed,Erk, sorry Nagisa. But at least you’re experiencing something new?
6-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:4,marker:bun_puns=excited,Nagisa, I can smell the bakery on you!
6-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:5=calm,It’s okay Nagisa. Sometimes, the people you meet in passing, you get to know far better than you might think.
6-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:5=excited,Wow Nagisa! You’re really giving it your all now, aren’t you?
6-female_must_strip,target:nagisa,targetStage:5,marker:marinette_ricebun=embarrassed,I-I’d offer to let you borrow my bra, if it wasn’t against the rules, we seem like we’re the same size...

6-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:0=calm,Soo... Navi, what's with your light?

6-female_must_strip,target:navi,targetStage:2=confident,I liked your flower, Navi!
6-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:0=confident,Tikki is telling me you're an oracle, Nayru! What does that mean, though? (Your dress is also <i>super</i> chic!)
6-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:1=confident,So... Nayru, can you rewind time? My Miraculous lets me do that!
6-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Nayru again? I just <i>love</i> your look! Um. Not that you're looking at me. Or at anyone.
6-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=alarmed,The akuma! It's got Nayru's--
6-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=confident,I'm so proud of you, Nayru! I know this isn't easy, but you're sticking with it! That's wonderful!
6-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=bored,I think I get it. You aren't an akuma, even if you're kind of a jerk, huh, Veran? You're sort of like Nayru's Kwami, aren't you?
6-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=wink,You're so gracious, Nayru! I-I wish I were more like you. I'd be a sputtering mess in your place...
6-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:6,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=alarmed,Veran, please don't destroy any more of Nayru's clothes... she might have a very embarrassing time walking home, and once you're out of energy...
6-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=embarrassed,W-well, from one magical person to another, I suppose it could be worse. You could've been Akumatized or something!
6-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:1=calm,Wait, your name is Neopolitan... like the ice cream, or the Italian area? Do you just not speak a language with us?
6-female_must_strip,target:neo,targetStage:4=bored,Oh goodness, you don’t even need an akuma, you have a really vicious aura about you…

6-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:1=wink,Hmm...Palutena, you’re a little bit of a trickster, aren’t you? I bet you and Tikki would get along.
6-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:4=confident,Don’t worry, Palutena. Even if you do get embarrassed, I can de-Akumatize you really quickly. I mean, I’d have to. A god with akuma powers would be really scary...Especially someone as powerful as you!
6-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:4=confident,Even if you’re a goddess, you’re still in this Palutena, and I won’t go easy on you!
6-female_must_strip,target:pearl,targetStage:1=confused,Hmm... You seem a bit... unusual, Pearl.

6-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:blake=excited,Wait a second, red and black together... That's why they call you a ladybug pair! Quelle chance!

6-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:2=embarrassed,You know, I think a skirt looks good on you, but I find pencil skirts really impractical...

6-female_must_strip,target:saki,targetStage:5=bored,So, Saki, what would you like to do after this? I have a few ideas, if you'd like!

6-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:1=excited,Samus, my powers are kind of similar to yours! I suit up and then have to build my own powerups each time.
6-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:2=wink,I thought mercenary-types regularly played cards in seedy bars. A-are you just throwing?
6-female_must_strip,target:sanako,targetStage:0=confident,W-well, if you insist, Sanako.
6-female_must_strip,target:sanako,targetStage:0,totalRounds:1-3=embarrassed,E-er. I'm sorry, Sanako, but... those are the rules, right? Is someone specifically targeting you, do you think?

6-female_must_strip,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=bored,I'm actually starting to enjoy the fireworks. I'm sorry your stuff's being damaged though...
6-female_must_strip,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=confused,I'm glad the explosions haven't... um... shown your panties... or your... I don't know enough nautical terminology to figure out what you'd call it...

6-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:1=confused,I'm starting to think that dice of yours is definitely the host of an akuma... Master Fuu wouldn't have trusted a Miraculous to... Er... Someone like <i>you</i>.
6-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:1=bored,I'm really starting to wonder if your dice is just an akuma target and I'm a big idiot for not noticing sooner.
6-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:2=embarrassed,A-at least you're still losing, Vriska. Trust me. You'll want to get rid of that evil butterfly as soon as possible.
6-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:kyu=embarrassed,Trust me, Vriska. You'll want to get rid of the evil butterfly in your dice as soon as possible. Er. Not Kyu. She's kinda gross but she's nice.

6-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:6,priority:381=excited,Well, well, looks like <i>someone</i> isn't so tough after all? How's it feel to meet someone who's <i>actually</i> lucky, Vriska?
6-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6a=confused,Please tell me you're going to dry off now. I-it's kind of hard to deal with you standing there soaked. M-my innate sense of heroism means I have to care about even <i>you, Vriska</i>.
6-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6b=wink,Oh, you're going to undress <i>again</i>? Playing by the rules is so, so challenging, isn't it, Vriska?

6-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0=bored,No, not particularly. I think I have to just treat you with the Chloe protocol...Assume your bad behavior on its own isn’t enough stress to Akumatize you…

-2-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:1=excited,Samus, my powers are kind of similar to yours! I suit up and then have to build my own powerups each time.
-2-female_must_strip,target:samus,targetStage:2=wink,I thought mercenary-types regularly played cards in seedy bars. A-are you just throwing?
-2-female_must_strip,target:sanako,targetStage:0=confident,W-well, if you insist, Sanako.

-2-female_must_strip,target:shantae,targetStage:3=calm,Okay, I’ve heard you on TV. Are you that <i>actually</i> that famous japanese runner? Miki Makimura?

-1-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:4=confident,Don’t worry, Palutena. Even if you do get embarrassed, I can de-Akumatize you really quickly. I mean, I’d have to. A god with akuma powers would be really scary...Especially someone as powerful as you!

#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

0-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=confident,Costume aside, I'm more of a fan of pink than red. A pink ladybug would look kind of weird, don't you think?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:red=embarrassed,Costume aside, I'm more of a fan of pink than red. E-er. N-not the Red here, I mean like the color! Kind of like Red's red hair!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=embarrassed,W-well, it's nice to see you like pink stuff too, Saki. B-but you're-- you're flashing us!

0-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=calm,Hmm... Yeah, that's a good question. It's not like my costume really ever gets damaged...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=confident,Agreed. Capes aren’t quite as good as a heavy cloak. But there’s something debonair about it!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=confused,Um. I don't mean to be critical, but the belts for your belts look is a bit too recent to be vintage...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=embarrassed,U-uhm. Are you sober enough to be playing, Sei? I'd hate for you to regret this.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=confident,I don’t want another Rogercop. It looks like you’re almost pre-loaded for that kind of thing…
0-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:0=bored,Hm… Are you a swordswoman seeking redemption? Maybe you have a broken sword of some sort?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Ah, <i>zut</i>, the purple hair made me imagine…
0-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:2=confident,That famous fashion company some girl managed to destroy?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:ryuko=wink,The one that Ryuko has some history with, right?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sharla,targetStage:0=bored,Are you... wait... no... that's not right...

0-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1=confident,Don’t be so hard on yourself! Dealing with spirits is really challenging, and you do that really well!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1=wink,Sometimes you lose a few hands, Sheena. Don’t worry. I’ll make sure you stay safe. From one spirit person to another.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:3=alarmed,Y-you know, maybe this can wait until after the game. Don't you use card-like seals? You're a bit... behind right now.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=alarmed,W-what? A-are you okay?! Someone get a fire extinguisher!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Your rudders... I'm not sure if you've been Akumatized, or this is a Miraculous, or something stranger...

0-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=alarmed,Spooky? Give me the knife, please. Let’s put away our weapons.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=confident,That’s super cool! Do you have a Miraculous or is this kind of power innate to you?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:daria=embarrassed,Godzilla? Oh, if it's a big enemy, I'd probably try to evacuate an area, then figure out what part of him was Akumatized.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=confused,Er. I can owl you chocolate-- call you Ochako, right?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:daria=confused,Oh, don't be rude, Daria! I'm sure what Ochako does on her knees is-- um... h-her business. (Just play it cool. You can act like nothing was said.)
0-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=alarmed,That lets him give people superpowers but also brings out their worst feelings.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=excited,Oh! You're Videl Satan! You're a really good fighter!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=alarmed,Wait! Are you using a Miraculous?!

0-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1c=confident,Maybe you have the Lion Miraculous, given how bright and regal your costume is!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2a=wink,Looks like you've been plundered, Vriska.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b=embarrassed,E-er, I'm <i>definitely</i> not into the whole maid thing, so I'm hoping whatever comes next is... A bit better.

0-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=calm,So, what'll it be <i>this</i> time, Vriska? Some sort of "goddess of <i>luck</i>" outfit?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=calm,So, what'll it be <i>this</i> time, Vriska? Some sort of "wandering martial artist" look?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:0=wink,Don't worry though! It'll be just like saving another Chloe.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:0=confused,Yes, Weiss. We know how rich you are. Your father owns a hotel and is a mayor or something, blah blah blah…
0-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:1=wink,Not all wealth is material, Weiss.

0-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:0=excited,And your hair does look pretty! It’s a very cool texture and color.
0-female_removed_accessory=confused,Oh, I guess it wasn’t an akuma…
0-female_removed_accessory=wink,Well, I guess we’ll get it next time!
0-female_removed_accessory=confused,You know, I’m starting to think that none of you are actually possessed.
0-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:cammy,alsoPlayingStage:3=calm,Wow! She's amazing! Um. I tope hey--hope they don't keep taking off her clothes though...
0-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:zoey,notSaidMarker:boundaries,marker:boundaries=wink,Don’t worry, Zoey, I think everyone’s being very accepting of other’s boundaries. That makes for a good game, right?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy,count-medic:1-3=alarmed,O-oh no! Shimakaze, be safe! Can one of the medics here come treat her? She doesn't seem to be having bad feelings, but... a possessed warship would be awful!

0-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1=embarrassed,I have to say, I don’t know what a GP is. But wherever you’re from, the style is very special!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:alice=embarrassed,Alice, do you think she means pounds? She doesn’t seem to mean Euro or francs…
0-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:rinkah=embarrassed,N-no? Oh. I seem...You just look...I promise I didn’t mean to imply--
0-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:tracer=embarrassed,Um. Did you mean a GBP? I think Tracer knows about that.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:weiss=confused,GP? Does she mean Lien, like you have over in Vale?

0-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=embarrassed,If so, do you have any particular trophy or device you like to play games with? Just curious, in case I have to free you from Hawk Moth.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=calm,I kind of have to rely on my Miraculous for most of my powers... I'd like to think I'm pretty athletic, but you're next level!

0-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:2=alarmed,I just wanted to let you know that it's nice to see, you know, someone who's similar to me go so far. You're a big hero to me. E-even though, you know, we're at this game.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:2=alarmed,It's-- I mean, most of the people around me in Paris. Um. Come from a different type of background. But you're a hero worldwide, so you, you know?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=confident,A Lucky Charm, you say? I can definitely relate to that.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=wink,I much prefer ribbons to keep my hair back, but hairbands can definitely be more fashionable for long hair like yours.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2,saidMarker:d.va_competition=wink,We'll just have to see h-how the rest goes, don't we, Hana?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:2=wink,It’s kind of important I keep mine on though. They’re not coming off this whole game, I promise.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:4=alarmed,It’s… Um… Complicated. Superhero stuff. (I really should probably preface my goals… Or not tell people before the get Akumatized…)
0-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1=alarmed,Y-you're beautiful in your own way, Daria, y-yut boo-- but you don't resemble him!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=bored,O-oh. It was a joke. W-well, maybe that's a profession you should follow-up on, Daria?

0-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:1=embarrassed,I-I have to admit, I feel really bad that you didn't choose to be here...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:1=calm,Most Miraculouses aren't weapons until they transform, but...

0-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:2=calm,Hmm... That belt looks familiar... Maruvian symbols, maybe? Tikki said something about that.

0-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=confused,I… Hm… You know, I never really considered the option of running away.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:1=bored,Your attitude is really bad. Hawk Moth will Akumatize you in no time if you keep being rude.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:1=embarrassed,S-sorry, GoGo. I don't know why I'm being so mean... You're being more than a little rude, though...

0-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:moon,alsoPlayingStage:1-10=embarrassed,Though I wouldn’t expect you to mimic her for anything else, I thought maybe Moon might have a trick to pull off that zipless undressing!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:twilight,alsoPlayingStage:1-10=embarrassed,Twilight has, um, however, disregarded normal social conventions. So if you wanted to, Jane, you definitely could?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:kim,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Oh, I definitely would--Um. Is what someone who found you cute would say.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:kim,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Oh! Well if you’re offering--Um. I know magic, Kim! And that’s not a real place!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:1=wink,<i>Cute</i> accessories, though. <i>Tres annes des quatre vingt dix.</i>.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:2=embarrassed,E-er, sorry if that's weird! I just never feel my clothes and kind of have to trust they're just there...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:4=confident,But a hero has to persevere and keep moving forward, no matter what happens.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=alarmed,Sexually frustrated before Akumatization, so I’ll keep an eye on you.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=confused,I-I mean I hope you are. Of akuma. Not only akuma but physically! I mean-! (Okay I’m going to stop.)
0-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Um... I don't quite know who you are, but I think putting the gun away is a good idea.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:lilith,targetStage:2=wink,Maybe you can show me more later! I mean, of your magic! N-not, but if you wanted to... Um!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:5=alarmed,I-I mean, your taste in fashion. Not... you know…
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:2=calm,Or maybe that was Li-Meng, the wizard? Either way, it's exciting to see you here!

0-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=excited,I’m glad you don’t get too caught up in your worries, Nagisa!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=embarrassed,It’s just the first round, Nagisa. Don’t worry! E-er, as in  no reason to get down! Not that you’ll--Erk.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:3,marker:coldfloor=confident,You did say you were worried about the floor being cold...It’s okay to be a warm person but sensitive to cold. You dress well for all environments!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:3=excited,I’m sure you have lots of other clothes, but if you wanted to go shopping after this, Nagisa, I’m sure we could find something cute!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=wink,Awww, don't give up! You're just starting to have fun... (<i>You're one to talk, Marinette! You're only here to protect these people, remember that!</i>)
0-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=embarrassed,Natsuki, being a woman is about being proud of who you are and the things you like. If ~player~ is the right person for you, they'll just appreciate you more! Um. The personality. Less the encroaching nudity...
0-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1=calm,Hmm... Well, it's nice to have such a powerful Oracle here with me today! Let's keep an eye out for the akuma, shall we?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:harped=excited,A magic harp! <i>You</i> must have a Miraculous, right, Naryu? What's your Kwami's name?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2=excited,I'm just happy you're having a good time! It would be a shame if you were the one the akuma was targeting!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:3=embarrassed,E-er... unless you remove your necklaces too. How'd you even get that on...?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Er. I mean. I’m saying it from an aesthetic point of you. Point of view. Not that--Uhm. Back to the game!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1=embarrassed,B-but you’re definitely still a goddess and I don’t mean to imply anything too torward fowards you. Forward towards you!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=excited,Oh! It’s magic too? And fine gold? It’s a little gaudy, to be honest, but if it keeps people safe!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=embarrassed,W-well normally I’d say it’s how you present yourself, but I think it’d be rude to say a goddess’s… Assets aren’t something heavenly!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:4=bored,Hmm, lots of belts, Palutena. What are you trying so hard to keep secret?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:4=excited,Oh! You’re not counting them individually. How graceful, Palutena.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=confident,Hmm...Palutena, Corrin might use the most tactical choice, but fashion requires a certain economy. I’d be happy to help, as a hero to a goddess of heroes.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:sei=embarrassed,Just fiven that your stuff is gorn fitting, I mean form fitting! Given form fitting! Erk. Both of you… Belts, right?

0-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=wink,I'm kind of a dork with how into pink I actually am. I bet you'd look really good in it too! Though your tie matched your glasses and eyes in a really cool way!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=wink,I'm kind of interested to see what you'd look like with a nice fluffy scarf. It's doesn't match as well as your tie, but I bet it'd be really comforting.

1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=embarrassed,I’m still not quite sure you’re not an agent of Hawk Moth who was… Er…
1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=excited,I guess you’re clean, Kyu!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=confused,Huh? What? Where'd... Is this... did I de-Akumatize Launch or something?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:lilith,targetStage:1=confident,Well, considering some of the others we’re playing with, I suppose I can trust in that.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:4=excited,All of your things are so finely made, I could learn a lot based on your taste!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=embarrassed,I've actually heard a lot about you! How you got lost in a Blizzard once...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f,saidMarker:corrin_meia_hair,priority:500,marker:corrins_meia_hair=embarrassed,The… Er. Boy Corrin.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_m,saidMarker:corrin_meia_hair=embarrassed,Um. You and him… Pull it off really well! You know. For something so… Universal!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=embarrassed,I know an Akumatized person when I see one... But I'm not sure I can see an accessory...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=excited,In Japan, you have multiple pairs of shoes for school, for your house, and outside, right? That must be nice to have so many opportunities to express yourself!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=confident,They’re nice shoes, Nagisa! The style seems maybe a year or two out of date, though.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=embarrassed,O-oh, sorry. I can look away if you’d like?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=alarmed,Oh! I’m sorry, Nagisa. It’s just a very cool jacket!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=confident,Oh! Your shoes and socks at the same time! I was worried over nothing. You're pretty brave, aren't you?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=confused,But you <i>are</i> really cute.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0=bored,Though um, based on your ears, you're not really from around France, are you?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1=bored,Fortunately, um, it looks like you don't really need to rewind since it's just your sandals...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2=confident,At least you have two rounds of small stuff left!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=excited,So Neopolitan like the ice cream... and you’re short. Oh you’re pint-sized! I get it!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=confident,I like your ribbons! Mine are way cooler in my costume than out, but I’d love to try yours on!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=confused,Webmaster? Have I fought that villain before…?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=confused,If you’re who I think you are, this akuma situation must be really serious for you to get involved!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=confident,You are well adorned! Both in accessories and otherwise.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=wink,Those are really cool armbands. I’m glad my costume normally works as armor, though. That seems a lot heavier. It’s such a relief to see you lose them, though.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:2=wink,Gracious of you to include the part actually keeping that on, Palutena.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:2=confident,Third time’s the charm, it just doesn’t seem to be a lucky one for you.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=confident,Belts? Oh! You’re rocking the “many belts” look. Befitting of a goddess.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=wink,Why limit yourself to conventional aesthetics, Palutena?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei=excited,Oh! You and Sei have something in common, with all of your belts. I’m surprised, given that they don’t seem to be keeping anything loose down.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:pearl,targetStage:0=alarmed,Whoa! I'm the only one who's supposed to transform!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:red,targetStage:0=embarrassed,I think this is, a, um. Bad idea. My yo-yo doesn’t count!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:red,targetStage:2=wink,Um. Exposed. Maybe it’s time for you to put away that sword?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=bored,Er... won't you at least part with your guns...?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=confused,N-no...? Er... I've yet to solve a problem that needed a gun...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=confident,Costume aside, I'm more of a fan of pink than red. A pink ladybug would look kind of weird, don't you think?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:red=embarrassed,Costume aside, I'm more of a fan of pink than red. E-er. N-not the Red here, I mean like the color! Kind of like Red's red hair!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=embarrassed,W-well, it's nice to see you like pink stuff too, Saki. B-but you're-- you're flashing us!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba,saidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba=confident,We should take care of Saki somehow! We don't want her to get Akumatized or feel ashamed!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=confident,Between the two of us lady heroes, we should be able to make sure this is at least <i>tolerable</i> for Saki, you know?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:0=excited,They say you can stand up to any challenge, no matter however demanding, and that your courage is amazing and…
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=calm,Hmm... Yeah, that's a good question. It's not like my costume really ever gets damaged...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=confident,Agreed. Capes aren’t quite as good as a heavy cloak. But there’s something debonair about it!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=confused,Um. I don't mean to be critical, but the belts for your belts look is a bit too recent to be vintage...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=embarrassed,U-uhm. Are you sober enough to be playing, Sei? I'd hate for you to regret this.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=confident,I don’t want another Rogercop. It looks like you’re almost pre-loaded for that kind of thing…
1-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:0=bored,Hm… Are you a swordswoman seeking redemption? Maybe you have a broken sword of some sort?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Ah, <i>zut</i>, the purple hair made me imagine…
1-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:2=confident,That famous fashion company some girl managed to destroy?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:ryuko=wink,The one that Ryuko has some history with, right?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sharla,targetStage:0=bored,Are you... wait... no... that's not right...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sharla,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:shazza=embarrassed,Oh! You're Shazza, right! W-wait...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1=confident,Don’t be so hard on yourself! Dealing with spirits is really challenging, and you do that really well!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1=wink,Sometimes you lose a few hands, Sheena. Don’t worry. I’ll make sure you stay safe. From one spirit person to another.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:3=alarmed,Y-you know, maybe this can wait until after the game. Don't you use card-like seals? You're a bit... behind right now.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=alarmed,W-what? A-are you okay?! Someone get a fire extinguisher!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Your rudders... I'm not sure if you've been Akumatized, or this is a Miraculous, or something stranger...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Oh no, not <i>again!</i> Shimakaze, are you okay?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=alarmed,Spooky? Give me the knife, please. Let’s put away our weapons.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=confident,That’s super cool! Do you have a Miraculous or is this kind of power innate to you?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:daria=embarrassed,Godzilla? Oh, if it's a big enemy, I'd probably try to evacuate an area, then figure out what part of him was Akumatized.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=confused,Er. I can owl you chocolate-- call you Ochako, right?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:daria=confused,Oh, don't be rude, Daria! I'm sure what Ochako does on her knees is-- um... h-her business. (Just play it cool. You can act like nothing was said.)
1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=alarmed,That lets him give people superpowers but also brings out their worst feelings.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=excited,Oh! You're Videl Satan! You're a really good fighter!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=alarmed,Wait! Are you using a Miraculous?!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=alarmed,Wait, are you using a Miraculous!? Was that your outfit?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=alarmed,H-hey! You can't use a Miraculous, can you!?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1b,alsoPlaying:futaba=excited,I mean <i>Alya</i> got Akumatized into a cyber-villain. If I could save her, beating you--er, saving you--should be easy!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1a=confused,Maybe... Hm... Something like a sprite? No... That's not an animal...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1b=confused,Hmm... I'm normally really good at this, but I can't figure out what kind of creature the Tron-motif is associated with...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1c=confident,Maybe you have the Lion Miraculous, given how bright and regal your costume is!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2a=wink,Looks like you've been plundered, Vriska.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b=embarrassed,E-er, I'm <i>definitely</i> not into the whole maid thing, so I'm hoping whatever comes next is... A bit better.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2c=embarrassed,At least you finally settled on some casualwear... Why are you transforming again?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=calm,So, what'll it be <i>this</i> time, Vriska? Some sort of "goddess of <i>luck</i>" outfit?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=calm,So, what'll it be <i>this</i> time, Vriska? Some sort of "wandering martial artist" look?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:0=wink,Don't worry though! It'll be just like saving another Chloe.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:0=confused,Yes, Weiss. We know how rich you are. Your father owns a hotel and is a mayor or something, blah blah blah…
1-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:1=wink,Not all wealth is material, Weiss.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:blake=bored,Blake, is Weiss always this… Bourgeois?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:ruby=bored,Yang, is Weiss always like this… Repugnant?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:yang=bored,Yang, is Weiss always this… Yawn-inducing?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:0=excited,And your hair does look pretty! It’s a very cool texture and color.
1-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:2=calm,What high coutoure, ~name~, please keep good care of it!
1-female_removed_accessory=confused,Shoot, I don’t have my yo-yo anymore. Good thing that wasn’t cursed by Hawk Moth.
1-female_removed_accessory=confident,Now that you’re disarmed, I guess we’ll have to start working through your other objects!
1-female_removed_accessory=confident,I guess that's all right... I'm used to the small stuff having an akuma in it, so no problem, ~name~!
1-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:cammy,alsoPlayingStage:3=calm,Wow! She's amazing! Um. I tope hey--hope they don't keep taking off her clothes though...
1-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:zoey,notSaidMarker:boundaries,marker:boundaries=wink,Don’t worry, Zoey, I think everyone’s being very accepting of other’s boundaries. That makes for a good game, right?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy,count-medic:1-3=alarmed,O-oh no! Shimakaze, be safe! Can one of the medics here come treat her? She doesn't seem to be having bad feelings, but... a possessed warship would be awful!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:2,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,count-uravity:1=excited,You're gonna be in great hands with Futaba and Ochako, Saki! Think of this like a girls night out where we talk about boys, and makeup, and um. Getting naked and comfy and stuff!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:red,targetStage:3,count-weapon:2,count-weapon:3=calm,What is with you and Aimee and the others and your weapons? You’re so reliant on things beyond your own wits.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:1=confident,Wow! You're super animated too! You're awesome, Alpha!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:amy_rose,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Oh! It's not a Miraculous. You're just like this!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:5=alarmed,Because I'm sweet on you! Er. No, I mean, you're a sweetheart.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1=confident,I may be an art student, but that doesn’t mean I’m not clever, Annie! Let's see what you've got!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba,marker:french=bored,What was that, Futaba? <i>Grossier.</i>
1-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:2=calm,Aren’t you supposed to be the smart one?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:april,targetStage:1=bored,Oh. Not anymore, huh? Well, the jumpsuit looks nice...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:1=calm,What brings you to a game like this, I wonder? Y-you know, from your storybook? Magic is such an interesting thing...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1=embarrassed,U-um. You’re good at games, right, Blackrose? Let’s just keep playing, don’t get down!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1=embarrassed,I have to say, I don’t know what a GP is. But wherever you’re from, the style is very special!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:alice=embarrassed,Alice, do you think she means pounds? She doesn’t seem to mean Euro or francs…
1-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:rinkah=embarrassed,N-no? Oh. I seem...You just look...I promise I didn’t mean to imply--
1-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:tracer=embarrassed,Um. Did you mean a GBP? I think Tracer knows about that.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:weiss=confused,GP? Does she mean Lien, like you have over in Vale?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:1=alarmed,Finger on! I-I would never unless you really wanted me to b-but-
1-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=confident,Huh, so that’s your secret! I have a weird feeling about Cat Noir right now…
1-female_removed_accessory,target:buffy,targetStage:4=calm,Drive me crazy as in... upset? Because that's not happening...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:buffy,targetStage:4=embarrassed,Drive me crazy as in... aroused... Uhm. Well.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=confident,Wow! You handled yourself so well, Cammy. Guess it's a good thing I didn't need to use my yo-yo, huh?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=embarrassed,If so, do you have any particular trophy or device you like to play games with? Just curious, in case I have to free you from Hawk Moth.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=calm,I kind of have to rely on my Miraculous for most of my powers... I'd like to think I'm pretty athletic, but you're next level!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=wink,I may not be the strongest woman in the world, but I'm actually a pretty good fighter, Chun-li!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:2=alarmed,I just wanted to let you know that it's nice to see, you know, someone who's similar to me go so far. You're a big hero to me. E-even though, you know, we're at this game.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:2=alarmed,It's-- I mean, most of the people around me in Paris. Um. Come from a different type of background. But you're a hero worldwide, so you, you know?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=confident,A Lucky Charm, you say? I can definitely relate to that.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=wink,I much prefer ribbons to keep my hair back, but hairbands can definitely be more fashionable for long hair like yours.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2,saidMarker:d.va_competition=wink,We'll just have to see h-how the rest goes, don't we, Hana?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:2=wink,It’s kind of important I keep mine on though. They’re not coming off this whole game, I promise.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:4=alarmed,It’s… Um… Complicated. Superhero stuff. (I really should probably preface my goals… Or not tell people before the get Akumatized…)
1-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1=alarmed,Y-you're beautiful in your own way, Daria, y-yut boo-- but you don't resemble him!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=bored,O-oh. It was a joke. W-well, maybe that's a profession you should follow-up on, Daria?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:3=confident,You are <i>quite</i> strange, Daria. But in a very likable way! I can see us being great friends!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:1=wink,And what's your name? I can't help but feel like there's something darkly magical about you...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:dawn,targetStage:2=alarmed,W-wow, you’re certainly forward about enjoying this, Dawn!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=embarrassed,I-it was a pretty bandana, anyway...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=embarrassed,You're really quite foxy, Elaine!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:2=confused,E-er. I think that may translate more sensibly in English...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:1=embarrassed,I-I have to admit, I feel really bad that you didn't choose to be here...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:2=alarmed,A jacquin? What's that? If it's anything like a panther, I really can't say I've had good experiences...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:2=embarrassed,B-but still, we should really try to win. A lot of people look up to us.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:2=calm,Hmm... That belt looks familiar... Maruvian symbols, maybe? Tikki said something about that.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:ann=wink,Is that like a panther of some sort? I bet Ann knows a thing about that.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1=confident,If you ever visit Paris, I'm sure we'd have a great time!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1=confident,That’s the spirit, Florina! Be brave!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1=wink,You did! Sorry you lost, but… Good job staying in the game!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=confident,Ladybug is here to keep you safe, Florina! Don’t get too worried!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=confused,I… Hm… You know, I never really considered the option of running away.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:1=bored,Your attitude is really bad. Hawk Moth will Akumatize you in no time if you keep being rude.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:1=embarrassed,S-sorry, GoGo. I don't know why I'm being so mean... You're being more than a little rude, though...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:1=alarmed,K-kinky? J-just because I have a very form fitting costume and a-- You know what, let's not follow this line of thought.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:2=embarrassed,I was about to say...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:5-10=wink,Though, Buffy did already show us how to take her bra off under her clothes...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:moon,alsoPlayingStage:1-10=embarrassed,Though I wouldn’t expect you to mimic her for anything else, I thought maybe Moon might have a trick to pull off that zipless undressing!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:twilight,alsoPlayingStage:1-10=embarrassed,Twilight has, um, however, disregarded normal social conventions. So if you wanted to, Jane, you definitely could?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:kim,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Oh, I definitely would--Um. Is what someone who found you cute would say.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:kim,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Oh! Well if you’re offering--Um. I know magic, Kim! And that’s not a real place!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:1=wink,<i>Cute</i> accessories, though. <i>Tres annes des quatre vingt dix.</i>.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:2=embarrassed,E-er, sorry if that's weird! I just never feel my clothes and kind of have to trust they're just there...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:4=confident,But a hero has to persevere and keep moving forward, no matter what happens.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=alarmed,Sexually frustrated before Akumatization, so I’ll keep an eye on you.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=confused,I-I mean I hope you are. Of akuma. Not only akuma but physically! I mean-! (Okay I’m going to stop.)
1-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Um... I don't quite know who you are, but I think putting the gun away is a good idea.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:lilith,targetStage:2=wink,Maybe you can show me more later! I mean, of your magic! N-not, but if you wanted to... Um!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:5=alarmed,I-I mean, your taste in fashion. Not... you know…
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:2=calm,Or maybe that was Li-Meng, the wizard? Either way, it's exciting to see you here!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,saidMarker:corrin_meia_hair=wink,He certainly manages to make a woman’s hairstyle work, <i>oui</i>, Meia?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,saidMarker:corrins_meia_hair,priority:500=confused,The… Er. Boy Corrin.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=confident,I guess I'll just have to wait and see!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:2=confused,W-w-wait!? Where'd all the bats come from!?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=excited,I’m glad you don’t get too caught up in your worries, Nagisa!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=embarrassed,It’s just the first round, Nagisa. Don’t worry! E-er, as in  no reason to get down! Not that you’ll--Erk.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:3,marker:coldfloor=confident,You did say you were worried about the floor being cold...It’s okay to be a warm person but sensitive to cold. You dress well for all environments!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:3=excited,I’m sure you have lots of other clothes, but if you wanted to go shopping after this, Nagisa, I’m sure we could find something cute!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=wink,Awww, don't give up! You're just starting to have fun... (<i>You're one to talk, Marinette! You're only here to protect these people, remember that!</i>)
1-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=embarrassed,Natsuki, being a woman is about being proud of who you are and the things you like. If ~player~ is the right person for you, they'll just appreciate you more! Um. The personality. Less the encroaching nudity...

2-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=embarrassed,That’s not nice, Hana! Everyone starts somewhere… And bad behavior will just get you banned. Or Akumatized. Let’s hope the former.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=wink,D.Va, could you sign my friend Nino’s album? He’s a big fan!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=wink,Lucio is pretty good for electronica… I’m more of a Jagged Stone girl, myself.

2-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=excited,In Japan, you have multiple pairs of shoes for school, for your house, and outside, right? That must be nice to have so many opportunities to express yourself!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=confident,They’re nice shoes, Nagisa! The style seems maybe a year or two out of date, though.

2-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=confident,You are well adorned! Both in accessories and otherwise.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=wink,Those are really cool armbands. I’m glad my costume normally works as armor, though. That seems a lot heavier. It’s such a relief to see you lose them, though.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:2=wink,Gracious of you to include the part actually keeping that on, Palutena.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:2=confident,Third time’s the charm, it just doesn’t seem to be a lucky one for you.

2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=confident,Costume aside, I'm more of a fan of pink than red. A pink ladybug would look kind of weird, don't you think?

2-female_removing_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=confident,Agreed. Capes aren’t quite as good as a heavy cloak. But there’s something debonair about it!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=confused,Um. I don't mean to be critical, but the belts for your belts look is a bit too recent to be vintage...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=embarrassed,U-uhm. Are you sober enough to be playing, Sei? I'd hate for you to regret this.

2-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:3=alarmed,Y-you know, maybe this can wait until after the game. Don't you use card-like seals? You're a bit... behind right now.

2-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Your rudders... I'm not sure if you've been Akumatized, or this is a Miraculous, or something stranger...

2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=confident,That’s super cool! Do you have a Miraculous or is this kind of power innate to you?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:daria=embarrassed,Godzilla? Oh, if it's a big enemy, I'd probably try to evacuate an area, then figure out what part of him was Akumatized.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=confused,Er. I can owl you chocolate-- call you Ochako, right?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:daria=confused,Oh, don't be rude, Daria! I'm sure what Ochako does on her knees is-- um... h-her business. (Just play it cool. You can act like nothing was said.)
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=alarmed,That lets him give people superpowers but also brings out their worst feelings.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=confused,Gloves! Gloves are coming off!

2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1b=confident,Say, Futaba, is Vriska's outfit like that Tron movie? Could you help me out with this?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1c=wink,Though maybe you have the Lion Miraculous, given how overconfident and prideful you're acting.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2a=wink,Looks like you've been plundered, Vriska.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b=embarrassed,E-er, I'm <i>definitely</i> not into the whole maid thing, so I'm hoping whatever comes next is... A bit better.

2-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:0=excited,And your hair does look pretty! It’s a very cool texture and color.
2-female_removed_accessory=calm,One of the nice things about being Marinette is that I can still help people out of costume, too.
2-female_removed_accessory=confused,You know, I’m starting to think that you aren’t actually possessed.

2-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Er. I mean. I’m saying it from an aesthetic point of you. Point of view. Not that--Uhm. Back to the game!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1=embarrassed,B-but you’re definitely still a goddess and I don’t mean to imply anything too torward fowards you. Forward towards you!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=excited,Oh! It’s magic too? And fine gold? It’s a little gaudy, to be honest, but if it keeps people safe!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=embarrassed,W-well normally I’d say it’s how you present yourself, but I think it’d be rude to say a goddess’s… Assets aren’t something heavenly!

3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1c=wink,Though maybe you have the Lion Miraculous, given how overconfident and prideful you're acting.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2a=wink,Looks like you've been plundered, Vriska.
3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b=embarrassed,E-er, I'm <i>definitely</i> not into the whole maid thing, so I'm hoping whatever comes next is... A bit better.

3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=calm,So, what'll it be <i>this</i> time, Vriska? Some sort of "goddess of <i>luck</i>" outfit?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=calm,So, what'll it be <i>this</i> time, Vriska? Some sort of "wandering martial artist" look?
3-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:0=confused,Yes, Weiss. We know how rich you are. Your father owns a hotel and is a mayor or something, blah blah blah…

3-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:2=alarmed,A jacquin? What's that? If it's anything like a panther, I really can't say I've had good experiences...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:2=embarrassed,B-but still, we should really try to win. A lot of people look up to us.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:ann=wink,Is that like a panther of some sort? I bet Ann knows a thing about that.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1=confident,If you ever visit Paris, I'm sure we'd have a great time!

3-female_removed_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:1=bored,Your attitude is really bad. Hawk Moth will Akumatize you in no time if you keep being rude.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:1=embarrassed,S-sorry, GoGo. I don't know why I'm being so mean... You're being more than a little rude, though...

3-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:moon,alsoPlayingStage:1-10=embarrassed,Though I wouldn’t expect you to mimic her for anything else, I thought maybe Moon might have a trick to pull off that zipless undressing!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:twilight,alsoPlayingStage:1-10=embarrassed,Twilight has, um, however, disregarded normal social conventions. So if you wanted to, Jane, you definitely could?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:kim,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Oh, I definitely would--Um. Is what someone who found you cute would say.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:kim,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Oh! Well if you’re offering--Um. I know magic, Kim! And that’s not a real place!

3-female_removed_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:2=embarrassed,E-er, sorry if that's weird! I just never feel my clothes and kind of have to trust they're just there...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:4=confident,But a hero has to persevere and keep moving forward, no matter what happens.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu=calm,I get the feeling that you’re nicer than you let on, Kyu! Just a bit vulgar for my tastes. I think.

3-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:3,marker:coldfloor=confident,You did say you were worried about the floor being cold...It’s okay to be a warm person but sensitive to cold. You dress well for all environments!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:3=excited,I’m sure you have lots of other clothes, but if you wanted to go shopping after this, Nagisa, I’m sure we could find something cute!

3-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=embarrassed,Natsuki, being a woman is about being proud of who you are and the things you like. If ~player~ is the right person for you, they'll just appreciate you more! Um. The personality. Less the encroaching nudity...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1=calm,Hmm... Well, it's nice to have such a powerful Oracle here with me today! Let's keep an eye out for the akuma, shall we?

3-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2=excited,I'm just happy you're having a good time! It would be a shame if you were the one the akuma was targeting!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:3=embarrassed,E-er... unless you remove your necklaces too. How'd you even get that on...?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Er. I mean. I’m saying it from an aesthetic point of you. Point of view. Not that--Uhm. Back to the game!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1=embarrassed,B-but you’re definitely still a goddess and I don’t mean to imply anything too torward fowards you. Forward towards you!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=excited,Oh! It’s magic too? And fine gold? It’s a little gaudy, to be honest, but if it keeps people safe!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=embarrassed,W-well normally I’d say it’s how you present yourself, but I think it’d be rude to say a goddess’s… Assets aren’t something heavenly!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:4=bored,Hmm, lots of belts, Palutena. What are you trying so hard to keep secret?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=confident,Hmm...Palutena, Corrin might use the most tactical choice, but fashion requires a certain economy. I’d be happy to help, as a hero to a goddess of heroes.

3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=wink,I'm kind of interested to see what you'd look like with a nice fluffy scarf. It's doesn't match as well as your tie, but I bet it'd be really comforting.

4-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=calm,Mercy, Switzerland has lots of things I find super interesting. The fashion, the languages, and the baking are all wonderful! And the people…
4-female_removing_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:3=confused,But Juleka once said there were some magic words if I ever found Chloe being too forward to Adrien…
4-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=embarrassed,I know an Akumatized person when I see one... But I'm not sure I can see an accessory...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=excited,In Japan, you have multiple pairs of shoes for school, for your house, and outside, right? That must be nice to have so many opportunities to express yourself!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=confident,They’re nice shoes, Nagisa! The style seems maybe a year or two out of date, though.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=embarrassed,O-oh, sorry. I can look away if you’d like?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=alarmed,Oh! I’m sorry, Nagisa. It’s just a very cool jacket!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=confident,Oh! Your shoes and socks at the same time! I was worried over nothing. You're pretty brave, aren't you?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=confused,But you <i>are</i> really cute.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0=bored,Though um, based on your ears, you're not really from around France, are you?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1=bored,Fortunately, um, it looks like you don't really need to rewind since it's just your sandals...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2=confident,At least you have two rounds of small stuff left!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=excited,So Neopolitan like the ice cream... and you’re short. Oh you’re pint-sized! I get it!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=confused,Webmaster? Have I fought that villain before…?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=confident,You are well adorned! Both in accessories and otherwise.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=wink,Those are really cool armbands. I’m glad my costume normally works as armor, though. That seems a lot heavier. It’s such a relief to see you lose them, though.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:2=wink,Gracious of you to include the part actually keeping that on, Palutena.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:2=confident,Third time’s the charm, it just doesn’t seem to be a lucky one for you.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=confident,Belts? Oh! You’re rocking the “many belts” look. Befitting of a goddess.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=wink,Why limit yourself to conventional aesthetics, Palutena?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei=excited,Oh! You and Sei have something in common, with all of your belts. I’m surprised, given that they don’t seem to be keeping anything loose down.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:pearl,targetStage:0=alarmed,Whoa! I'm the only one who's supposed to transform!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:red,targetStage:0=embarrassed,I think this is, a, um. Bad idea. My yo-yo doesn’t count!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:red,targetStage:2=wink,Um. Exposed. Maybe it’s time for you to put away that sword?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=bored,Er... won't you at least part with your guns...?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=confused,N-no...? Er... I've yet to solve a problem that needed a gun...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=confident,Costume aside, I'm more of a fan of pink than red. A pink ladybug would look kind of weird, don't you think?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:red=embarrassed,Costume aside, I'm more of a fan of pink than red. E-er. N-not the Red here, I mean like the color! Kind of like Red's red hair!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=embarrassed,W-well, it's nice to see you like pink stuff too, Saki. B-but you're-- you're flashing us!

4-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=calm,Hmm... Yeah, that's a good question. It's not like my costume really ever gets damaged...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=confident,Agreed. Capes aren’t quite as good as a heavy cloak. But there’s something debonair about it!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=confused,Um. I don't mean to be critical, but the belts for your belts look is a bit too recent to be vintage...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=embarrassed,U-uhm. Are you sober enough to be playing, Sei? I'd hate for you to regret this.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=confident,I don’t want another Rogercop. It looks like you’re almost pre-loaded for that kind of thing…
4-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:0=bored,Hm… Are you a swordswoman seeking redemption? Maybe you have a broken sword of some sort?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Ah, <i>zut</i>, the purple hair made me imagine…
4-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:2=confident,That famous fashion company some girl managed to destroy?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:ryuko=wink,The one that Ryuko has some history with, right?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sharla,targetStage:0=bored,Are you... wait... no... that's not right...

4-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1=confident,Don’t be so hard on yourself! Dealing with spirits is really challenging, and you do that really well!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1=wink,Sometimes you lose a few hands, Sheena. Don’t worry. I’ll make sure you stay safe. From one spirit person to another.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:3=alarmed,Y-you know, maybe this can wait until after the game. Don't you use card-like seals? You're a bit... behind right now.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=alarmed,W-what? A-are you okay?! Someone get a fire extinguisher!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Your rudders... I'm not sure if you've been Akumatized, or this is a Miraculous, or something stranger...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Oh no, not <i>again!</i> Shimakaze, are you okay?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0=alarmed,Cool because it's a calming color. Also because it's interesting! It raises so many questions like if it's dyed or not!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=alarmed,Spooky? Give me the knife, please. Let’s put away our weapons.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=confident,That’s super cool! Do you have a Miraculous or is this kind of power innate to you?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:daria=embarrassed,Godzilla? Oh, if it's a big enemy, I'd probably try to evacuate an area, then figure out what part of him was Akumatized.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=confused,Er. I can owl you chocolate-- call you Ochako, right?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:daria=confused,Oh, don't be rude, Daria! I'm sure what Ochako does on her knees is-- um... h-her business. (Just play it cool. You can act like nothing was said.)
4-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=alarmed,That lets him give people superpowers but also brings out their worst feelings.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=confused,Gloves! Gloves are coming off!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=confident,I’m glad to see the senzu bean grows far from the vine, Videl!

4-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1a=wink,At least that was a cool outfit. Definitely not stolen. *Cough* Pot *cough* meet *cough* kettle *cough*.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1b=confident,Say, Futaba, is Vriska's outfit like that Tron movie? Could you help me out with this?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1c=wink,Though maybe you have the Lion Miraculous, given how overconfident and prideful you're acting.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2a=wink,Looks like you've been plundered, Vriska.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b=embarrassed,E-er, I'm <i>definitely</i> not into the whole maid thing, so I'm hoping whatever comes next is... A bit better.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2c=embarrassed,At least you finally settled on some casualwear... Why are you transforming again?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=calm,So, what'll it be <i>this</i> time, Vriska? Some sort of "goddess of <i>luck</i>" outfit?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=calm,So, what'll it be <i>this</i> time, Vriska? Some sort of "wandering martial artist" look?
4-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:0=confused,Yes, Weiss. We know how rich you are. Your father owns a hotel and is a mayor or something, blah blah blah…
4-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:1=wink,Not all wealth is material, Weiss.

4-female_removing_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:2=alarmed,N-not to insult your choice of apparel, just that it has to be awfully hard to find clothes that fit...
4-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:0=excited,And your hair does look pretty! It’s a very cool texture and color.
4-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:2=calm,~Clothing~... Hm... Are those markings Agreste? A Revocs or Ray=Out maybe?
4-female_removed_accessory=wink,You better get it together, or the Dealer’s going to have his way with you. Er...

4-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1=embarrassed,I have to say, I don’t know what a GP is. But wherever you’re from, the style is very special!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:alice=embarrassed,Alice, do you think she means pounds? She doesn’t seem to mean Euro or francs…

4-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=embarrassed,If so, do you have any particular trophy or device you like to play games with? Just curious, in case I have to free you from Hawk Moth.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=calm,I kind of have to rely on my Miraculous for most of my powers... I'd like to think I'm pretty athletic, but you're next level!

4-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=wink,I much prefer ribbons to keep my hair back, but hairbands can definitely be more fashionable for long hair like yours.

4-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:2=alarmed,A jacquin? What's that? If it's anything like a panther, I really can't say I've had good experiences...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:2=embarrassed,B-but still, we should really try to win. A lot of people look up to us.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:ann=wink,Is that like a panther of some sort? I bet Ann knows a thing about that.

4-female_removed_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:1=bored,Your attitude is really bad. Hawk Moth will Akumatize you in no time if you keep being rude.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:1=embarrassed,S-sorry, GoGo. I don't know why I'm being so mean... You're being more than a little rude, though...

4-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:twilight,alsoPlayingStage:1-10=embarrassed,Twilight has, um, however, disregarded normal social conventions. So if you wanted to, Jane, you definitely could?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:kim,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Oh, I definitely would--Um. Is what someone who found you cute would say.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:kim,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Oh! Well if you’re offering--Um. I know magic, Kim! And that’s not a real place!

4-female_removed_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:2=embarrassed,E-er, sorry if that's weird! I just never feel my clothes and kind of have to trust they're just there...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:4=confident,But a hero has to persevere and keep moving forward, no matter what happens.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu=calm,I get the feeling that you’re nicer than you let on, Kyu! Just a bit vulgar for my tastes. I think.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=wink,Well! I’m always happy to make new friends.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Um... I don't quite know who you are, but I think putting the gun away is a good idea.

5-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=confident,Or do you just seem a little... bored? I really hope it’s boredom rather than stress!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=embarrassed,Um. Do those bracelets really weigh 8kg each, Chun-li?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:0=confident,Those bracelets of yours have to be <i>amazing</i> for training, Chun-li!

5-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=embarrassed,But I don’t think they really know this much…
5-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=embarrassed,That’s not nice, Hana! Everyone starts somewhere… And bad behavior will just get you banned. Or Akumatized. Let’s hope the former.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=wink,D.Va, could you sign my friend Nino’s album? He’s a big fan!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=wink,Lucio is pretty good for electronica… I’m more of a Jagged Stone girl, myself.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=confident,I’ve never seen a bunny miraculous, and it would explain your awesome reflexes! Just not at cards.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:alpha=embarrassed,Um, D.Va, if you asked nicely, I’m sure Alpha would be happy to sing what you were listening to for all of us!

5-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1=embarrassed,O-oh. Daria <i>c'est une dominatrice.</i> That makes sense.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=confused,If your angst didn’t turn you into a villain, that is.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=embarrassed,W-wait, are there people that are into <i>feet</i>!?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:0=confident,That hat was so cute though! It's <i>tres</i> stylish. Where'd you get it?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:1=confident,A lucky necklace? Well, it's lucky I got to meet you today, Dark Magician Girl!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:dawn,targetStage:1=excited,Oh, you’re from a colder part of the world? I thought it was because people there were stylish, since… You’re in a skirt.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:0,notSaidMarker:elaine_puns=bored,That seems a little unfair, Elaine...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:0,saidMarker:elaine_puns=bored,It feels like Cat Noir is here, and not in a good way.

5-female_removing_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:0=wink,Like what? Being sassy and obnoxious?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:0=wink,Such as what? A weak sense of style and a weaker sense of honor?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:0=calm,It’s definitely well loved and tailored. I can tell you care a lot about it.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:1=confused,That seems… Very difficult, Jane.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:amalia,alsoPlayingStage:4-9=confident,Amalia did show us how to be clever with attire, so I shouldn’t discount anything you have hidden up your sleeve! Or… Erk, pants.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:kimberly=bored,Say, I have to ask, from one suit-wearing hero to another, where does your stuff <i>go</i> while you're transformed?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:0=wink,Well, my Miraculous has a guardian spirit. Her name is Tikki, but even if you can't see her, she's right here...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:3=calm,Korra, I can understand being insecure…
5-female_removing_accessory,target:kyoko,targetStage:0=wink,The gloves are especially classy touch.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=bored,For a love fairy you certainly seem focused on physical stuff…
5-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=excited,The collar? Hmm… I’ll admit, I was… Um. <i>Interested</i> to see more.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:1=confused,Huh? What? Where'd... Is this... did I de-Akumatize Launch or something?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:lilith,targetStage:1=confident,Well, considering some of the others we’re playing with, I suppose I can trust in that.

5-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=embarrassed,I know an Akumatized person when I see one... But I'm not sure I can see an accessory...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=excited,In Japan, you have multiple pairs of shoes for school, for your house, and outside, right? That must be nice to have so many opportunities to express yourself!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=confident,They’re nice shoes, Nagisa! The style seems maybe a year or two out of date, though.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=embarrassed,O-oh, sorry. I can look away if you’d like?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=alarmed,Oh! I’m sorry, Nagisa. It’s just a very cool jacket!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=confident,Oh! Your shoes and socks at the same time! I was worried over nothing. You're pretty brave, aren't you?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=confused,But you <i>are</i> really cute.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0=bored,Though um, based on your ears, you're not really from around France, are you?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1=bored,Fortunately, um, it looks like you don't really need to rewind since it's just your sandals...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2=confident,At least you have two rounds of small stuff left!

5-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=confident,You are well adorned! Both in accessories and otherwise.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=wink,Those are really cool armbands. I’m glad my costume normally works as armor, though. That seems a lot heavier. It’s such a relief to see you lose them, though.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:2=wink,Gracious of you to include the part actually keeping that on, Palutena.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:2=confident,Third time’s the charm, it just doesn’t seem to be a lucky one for you.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=confident,Belts? Oh! You’re rocking the “many belts” look. Befitting of a goddess.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=wink,Why limit yourself to conventional aesthetics, Palutena?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei=excited,Oh! You and Sei have something in common, with all of your belts. I’m surprised, given that they don’t seem to be keeping anything loose down.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:pearl,targetStage:0=alarmed,Whoa! I'm the only one who's supposed to transform!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:red,targetStage:0=embarrassed,I think this is, a, um. Bad idea. My yo-yo doesn’t count!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:red,targetStage:2=wink,Um. Exposed. Maybe it’s time for you to put away that sword?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=bored,Er... won't you at least part with your guns...?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=confused,N-no...? Er... I've yet to solve a problem that needed a gun...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=confident,Costume aside, I'm more of a fan of pink than red. A pink ladybug would look kind of weird, don't you think?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:red=embarrassed,Costume aside, I'm more of a fan of pink than red. E-er. N-not the Red here, I mean like the color! Kind of like Red's red hair!

5-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=calm,Hmm... Yeah, that's a good question. It's not like my costume really ever gets damaged...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=confident,Agreed. Capes aren’t quite as good as a heavy cloak. But there’s something debonair about it!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=confused,Um. I don't mean to be critical, but the belts for your belts look is a bit too recent to be vintage...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=embarrassed,U-uhm. Are you sober enough to be playing, Sei? I'd hate for you to regret this.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=confident,I don’t want another Rogercop. It looks like you’re almost pre-loaded for that kind of thing…
5-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:0=bored,Hm… Are you a swordswoman seeking redemption? Maybe you have a broken sword of some sort?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Ah, <i>zut</i>, the purple hair made me imagine…

5-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1=wink,Sometimes you lose a few hands, Sheena. Don’t worry. I’ll make sure you stay safe. From one spirit person to another.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:3=alarmed,Y-you know, maybe this can wait until after the game. Don't you use card-like seals? You're a bit... behind right now.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=alarmed,W-what? A-are you okay?! Someone get a fire extinguisher!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Your rudders... I'm not sure if you've been Akumatized, or this is a Miraculous, or something stranger...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Oh no, not <i>again!</i> Shimakaze, are you okay?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=alarmed,Spooky? Give me the knife, please. Let’s put away our weapons.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=confident,That’s super cool! Do you have a Miraculous or is this kind of power innate to you?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:daria=embarrassed,Godzilla? Oh, if it's a big enemy, I'd probably try to evacuate an area, then figure out what part of him was Akumatized.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=confused,Er. I can owl you chocolate-- call you Ochako, right?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:daria=confused,Oh, don't be rude, Daria! I'm sure what Ochako does on her knees is-- um... h-her business. (Just play it cool. You can act like nothing was said.)
5-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=alarmed,That lets him give people superpowers but also brings out their worst feelings.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=confused,Gloves! Gloves are coming off!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=confident,I’m glad to see the senzu bean grows far from the vine, Videl!

5-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=embarrassed,What magic is this?! Did you have a Miraculous this whole time!?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=confident,Whoa! You're going to detransform too right--
5-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1b,alsoPlaying:futaba=excited,I mean <i>Alya</i> got Akumatized into a cyber-villain. If I could save her, beating you--er, saving you--should be easy!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1a=wink,At least that was a cool outfit. Definitely not stolen. *Cough* Pot *cough* meet *cough* kettle *cough*.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1b=confident,Say, Futaba, is Vriska's outfit like that Tron movie? Could you help me out with this?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1c=wink,Though maybe you have the Lion Miraculous, given how overconfident and prideful you're acting.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2a=wink,Looks like you've been plundered, Vriska.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b=embarrassed,E-er, I'm <i>definitely</i> not into the whole maid thing, so I'm hoping whatever comes next is... A bit better.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2c=embarrassed,At least you finally settled on some casualwear... Why are you transforming again?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=calm,So, what'll it be <i>this</i> time, Vriska? Some sort of "goddess of <i>luck</i>" outfit?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=calm,So, what'll it be <i>this</i> time, Vriska? Some sort of "wandering martial artist" look?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:0=confused,Yes, Weiss. We know how rich you are. Your father owns a hotel and is a mayor or something, blah blah blah…

5-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:0=excited,And your hair does look pretty! It’s a very cool texture and color.
5-female_removing_accessory,targetStage:2=calm,You know, I used to read this magazine called Bleach... The models wore something fancy like that!
5-female_removed_accessory=confident,I don’t really want to see you naked but it’d be nice to not be the only one!
5-female_removed_accessory=calm,I feel like I need it to cover up, given how you seem to have extra.
5-female_removed_accessory=wink,Okay, ~name~, I think you’re still in this.
5-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:cammy,alsoPlayingStage:3=calm,Wow! She's amazing! Um. I tope hey--hope they don't keep taking off her clothes though...
5-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kimberly,alsoPlayingStage:1=embarrassed,W-well, I-I can hardly blame you. To keep your hair nice. I mean. I tend to like cute, low maintainance stuff.
5-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:zoey,notSaidMarker:boundaries,marker:boundaries=wink,Don’t worry, Zoey, I think everyone’s being very accepting of other’s boundaries. That makes for a good game, right?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy,count-medic:1-3=alarmed,O-oh no! Shimakaze, be safe! Can one of the medics here come treat her? She doesn't seem to be having bad feelings, but... a possessed warship would be awful!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:2,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,count-uravity:1=excited,You're gonna be in great hands with Futaba and Ochako, Saki!

5-female_removed_accessory,target:red,targetStage:3,count-weapon:2,count-weapon:3=calm,What is with you and Aimee and the others and your weapons? You’re so reliant on things beyond your own wits.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:1=confident,Wow! You're super animated too! You're awesome, Alpha!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:3=confident,You know, I did do a cover... Of the artistic variety! I'm not a great singer... For Jagged Stone. Maybe I could do one for you too?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:4=confident,Hmm... Okay, Alpha, can you do... Born to be Free, by X Japan?

5-female_removed_accessory,target:april,targetStage:1=bored,Oh. Not anymore, huh? Well, the jumpsuit looks nice...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:1=calm,What brings you to a game like this, I wonder? Y-you know, from your storybook? Magic is such an interesting thing...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1=embarrassed,U-um. You’re good at games, right, Blackrose? Let’s just keep playing, don’t get down!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1=embarrassed,I have to say, I don’t know what a GP is. But wherever you’re from, the style is very special!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:alice=embarrassed,Alice, do you think she means pounds? She doesn’t seem to mean Euro or francs…
5-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:rinkah=embarrassed,N-no? Oh. I seem...You just look...I promise I didn’t mean to imply--
5-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:tracer=embarrassed,Um. Did you mean a GBP? I think Tracer knows about that.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:weiss=confused,GP? Does she mean Lien, like you have over in Vale?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:1=alarmed,Finger on! I-I would never unless you really wanted me to b-but-
5-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=confident,Huh, so that’s your secret! I have a weird feeling about Cat Noir right now…

5-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=confident,Wow! You handled yourself so well, Cammy. Guess it's a good thing I didn't need to use my yo-yo, huh?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=embarrassed,If so, do you have any particular trophy or device you like to play games with? Just curious, in case I have to free you from Hawk Moth.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=calm,I kind of have to rely on my Miraculous for most of my powers... I'd like to think I'm pretty athletic, but you're next level!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=wink,I may not be the strongest woman in the world, but I'm actually a pretty good fighter, Chun-li!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:2=alarmed,I just wanted to let you know that it's nice to see, you know, someone who's similar to me go so far. You're a big hero to me. E-even though, you know, we're at this game.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:2=alarmed,It's-- I mean, most of the people around me in Paris. Um. Come from a different type of background. But you're a hero worldwide, so you, you know?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=confident,A Lucky Charm, you say? I can definitely relate to that.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=wink,I much prefer ribbons to keep my hair back, but hairbands can definitely be more fashionable for long hair like yours.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2,saidMarker:d.va_competition=wink,We'll just have to see h-how the rest goes, don't we, Hana?

5-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1=alarmed,Y-you're beautiful in your own way, Daria, y-yut boo-- but you don't resemble him!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=bored,O-oh. It was a joke. W-well, maybe that's a profession you should follow-up on, Daria?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:3=confident,You are <i>quite</i> strange, Daria. But in a very likable way! I can see us being great friends!

6-female_removing_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=confident,Agreed. Capes aren’t quite as good as a heavy cloak. But there’s something debonair about it!
6-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=confused,Um. I don't mean to be critical, but the belts for your belts look is a bit too recent to be vintage...
6-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=embarrassed,U-uhm. Are you sober enough to be playing, Sei? I'd hate for you to regret this.

6-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:3=alarmed,Y-you know, maybe this can wait until after the game. Don't you use card-like seals? You're a bit... behind right now.

6-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Your rudders... I'm not sure if you've been Akumatized, or this is a Miraculous, or something stranger...

6-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:daria=confused,Oh, don't be rude, Daria! I'm sure what Ochako does on her knees is-- um... h-her business. (Just play it cool. You can act like nothing was said.)
6-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=alarmed,That lets him give people superpowers but also brings out their worst feelings.

6-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2a=wink,Looks like you've been plundered, Vriska.
6-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b=embarrassed,E-er, I'm <i>definitely</i> not into the whole maid thing, so I'm hoping whatever comes next is... A bit better.

6-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1=embarrassed,I have to say, I don’t know what a GP is. But wherever you’re from, the style is very special!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:alice=embarrassed,Alice, do you think she means pounds? She doesn’t seem to mean Euro or francs…
6-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:rinkah=embarrassed,N-no? Oh. I seem...You just look...I promise I didn’t mean to imply--
6-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:tracer=embarrassed,Um. Did you mean a GBP? I think Tracer knows about that.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:weiss=confused,GP? Does she mean Lien, like you have over in Vale?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:1=alarmed,Finger on! I-I would never unless you really wanted me to b-but-
6-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=confident,Huh, so that’s your secret! I have a weird feeling about Cat Noir right now…
6-female_removed_accessory,target:buffy,targetStage:4=calm,Drive me crazy as in... upset? Because that's not happening...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:buffy,targetStage:4=embarrassed,Drive me crazy as in... aroused... Uhm. Well.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=confident,Wow! You handled yourself so well, Cammy. Guess it's a good thing I didn't need to use my yo-yo, huh?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=embarrassed,If so, do you have any particular trophy or device you like to play games with? Just curious, in case I have to free you from Hawk Moth.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=calm,I kind of have to rely on my Miraculous for most of my powers... I'd like to think I'm pretty athletic, but you're next level!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=wink,I may not be the strongest woman in the world, but I'm actually a pretty good fighter, Chun-li!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:2=alarmed,I just wanted to let you know that it's nice to see, you know, someone who's similar to me go so far. You're a big hero to me. E-even though, you know, we're at this game.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:2=alarmed,It's-- I mean, most of the people around me in Paris. Um. Come from a different type of background. But you're a hero worldwide, so you, you know?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=confident,A Lucky Charm, you say? I can definitely relate to that.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=wink,I much prefer ribbons to keep my hair back, but hairbands can definitely be more fashionable for long hair like yours.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2,saidMarker:d.va_competition=wink,We'll just have to see h-how the rest goes, don't we, Hana?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:2=wink,I’d love to try yours, but I’m a one-set kind of girl.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1=alarmed,Y-you're beautiful in your own way, Daria, y-yut boo-- but you don't resemble him!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=bored,O-oh. It was a joke. W-well, maybe that's a profession you should follow-up on, Daria?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:3=confident,You are <i>quite</i> strange, Daria. But in a very likable way! I can see us being great friends!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:1=wink,And what's your name? I can't help but feel like there's something darkly magical about you...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:dawn,targetStage:2=embarrassed,I-It’s either already steamy or already chilly, Dawn. I’m not sure which.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=embarrassed,I-it was a pretty bandana, anyway...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=embarrassed,You're really quite foxy, Elaine!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:2=confused,E-er. I think that may translate more sensibly in English...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:1=embarrassed,I-I have to admit, I feel really bad that you didn't choose to be here...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:2=alarmed,A jacquin? What's that? If it's anything like a panther, I really can't say I've had good experiences...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:2=embarrassed,B-but still, we should really try to win. A lot of people look up to us.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:ann=wink,Is that like a panther of some sort? I bet Ann knows a thing about that.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1=confident,If you ever visit Paris, I'm sure we'd have a great time!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1=confident,That’s the spirit, Florina! Be brave!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1=wink,You did! Sorry you lost, but… Good job staying in the game!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=confident,Ladybug is here to keep you safe, Florina! Don’t get too worried!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=confused,I… Hm… You know, I never really considered the option of running away.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:1=bored,Your attitude is really bad. Hawk Moth will Akumatize you in no time if you keep being rude.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:1=embarrassed,S-sorry, GoGo. I don't know why I'm being so mean... You're being more than a little rude, though...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:1=alarmed,K-kinky? J-just because I have a very form fitting costume and a-- You know what, let's not follow this line of thought.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:2=embarrassed,I was about to say...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:5-10=wink,Though, Buffy did already show us how to take her bra off under her clothes...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:moon,alsoPlayingStage:1-10=embarrassed,Though I wouldn’t expect you to mimic her for anything else, I thought maybe Moon might have a trick to pull off that zipless undressing!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:twilight,alsoPlayingStage:1-10=embarrassed,Twilight has, um, however, disregarded normal social conventions. So if you wanted to, Jane, you definitely could?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:kim,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Oh, I definitely would--Um. Is what someone who found you cute would say.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:kim,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Oh! Well if you’re offering--Um. I know magic, Kim! And that’s not a real place!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:2=embarrassed,E-er, sorry if that's weird! I just never feel my clothes and kind of have to trust they're just there...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:4=confident,But a hero has to persevere and keep moving forward, no matter what happens.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=alarmed,(Have I been fighting too many akuma? Do I… Um. Do I really just need to find some… <i>release?</i>)
6-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=wink,I <i>may</i> have fantasized about it. Just a bit.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Um... I don't quite know who you are, but I think putting the gun away is a good idea.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:lilith,targetStage:2=wink,Maybe you can show me more later! I mean, of your magic! N-not, but if you wanted to... Um!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:5=alarmed,I-I mean, your taste in fashion. Not... you know…
6-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:2=calm,Or maybe that was Li-Meng, the wizard? Either way, it's exciting to see you here!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,saidMarker:corrin_meia_hair=wink,He certainly manages to make a woman’s hairstyle work, <i>oui</i>, Meia?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,saidMarker:corrins_meia_hair,priority:500=confused,The… Er. Boy Corrin.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:2=embarrassed,I-I mean they’re pretty wonderful too, just looking at you. Not you specifically, I mean generally, but you’re nice too, I’m just going to stop now.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=bored,Um. What were those magic words…?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=confident,I guess I'll just have to wait and see!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:2=confused,W-w-wait!? Where'd all the bats come from!?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=excited,I’m glad you don’t get too caught up in your worries, Nagisa!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=embarrassed,It’s just the first round, Nagisa. Don’t worry! E-er, as in  no reason to get down! Not that you’ll--Erk.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:3,marker:coldfloor=confident,You did say you were worried about the floor being cold...It’s okay to be a warm person but sensitive to cold. You dress well for all environments!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:3=excited,I’m sure you have lots of other clothes, but if you wanted to go shopping after this, Nagisa, I’m sure we could find something cute!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=wink,Awww, don't give up! You're just starting to have fun... (<i>You're one to talk, Marinette! You're only here to protect these people, remember that!</i>)
6-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=embarrassed,Natsuki, being a woman is about being proud of who you are and the things you like. If ~player~ is the right person for you, they'll just appreciate you more! Um. The personality. Less the encroaching nudity...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1=calm,Hmm... Well, it's nice to have such a powerful Oracle here with me today! Let's keep an eye out for the akuma, shall we?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:harped=excited,A magic harp! <i>You</i> must have a Miraculous, right, Naryu? What's your Kwami's name?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2=excited,I'm just happy you're having a good time! It would be a shame if you were the one the akuma was targeting!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:3=embarrassed,E-er... unless you remove your necklaces too. How'd you even get that on...?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Er. I mean. I’m saying it from an aesthetic point of you. Point of view. Not that--Uhm. Back to the game!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1=embarrassed,B-but you’re definitely still a goddess and I don’t mean to imply anything too torward fowards you. Forward towards you!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=excited,Oh! It’s magic too? And fine gold? It’s a little gaudy, to be honest, but if it keeps people safe!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=embarrassed,W-well normally I’d say it’s how you present yourself, but I think it’d be rude to say a goddess’s… Assets aren’t something heavenly!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:4=bored,Hmm, lots of belts, Palutena. What are you trying so hard to keep secret?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=confident,Hmm...Palutena, Corrin might use the most tactical choice, but fashion requires a certain economy. I’d be happy to help, as a hero to a goddess of heroes.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:sei=embarrassed,Just fiven that your stuff is gorn fitting, I mean form fitting! Given form fitting! Erk. Both of you… Belts, right?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:pearl,targetStage:1=excited,This is going to be a lot more interesting than I thought! I-I mean, not you specifically Pearl b-but...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:red,targetStage:1=alarmed,B-but that huge thing… Can you really carry that?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:red,targetStage:3=embarrassed,N-no?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=embarrassed,<i>Gosh</i> you have so many euphemisms for promiscuity...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:2=embarrassed,F-fine. Be that way.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=wink,I'm kind of a dork with how into pink I actually am. I bet you'd look really good in it too! Though your tie matched your glasses and eyes in a really cool way!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=wink,I'm kind of interested to see what you'd look like with a nice fluffy scarf. It's doesn't match as well as your tie, but I bet it'd be really comforting.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=alarmed,I-I mean your panties looked fretty passionable to me-- O-oh erm. Pretty fashionable. A-and you were talking about your shoes. Erk. O-okay then.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=alarmed,I thought those panties looked fretty passionable though! I-I mean, um. Pretty fashionable. W-wait, you were talking about your shoes?

6-female_removed_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:1=alarmed,A-and that your boobies were. Um! Outstanding.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Well, I guess we don't have to worry about that tonight...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:ann=wink,Though I think an elegant coat or something like that would be something to see too, wouldn’t you agree Ann?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba=wink,Though I think an elegant coat or something like that would be something to see too, wouldn’t you agree Futaba?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=confident,Well! You seem like you're having fun!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan=alarmed,Wait, Streaming-chan has a real name? And you know each other? And... <i>my,</i> you have stories.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:seven,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Seven… Mme. Nine? Um. My earrings are an accessory, and they’re the one thing I almost never take off. Accessories can be really important for an outfit or a person!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:1=excited,No…? Weird, I had a feeling… Let me try again…
6-female_removed_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:2=confused,You sound <i>so</i> familiar! I can’t quite pin down why!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:3=embarrassed,No? Hmm… Shantae, you just sound really familiar…
6-female_removed_accessory,target:sharla,targetStage:1=confident,I'm sure I'll figure it out.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:sharla,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:shazza=bored,No, Shazza is the blonde Australian... Hm... I'm sorry, I keep forgetting your name.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=confused,Repairs? Ash? A-are you okay? You seem awfully resilient to harm... but... er... I'm confused now.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=wink,Well... your outfit's so cute and while you may be a little... different, I'll go with it for now!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Um... well, let's see, I suppose.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:dizzy=alarmed,Er... <i>SHIMAKAZE, ARE YOU OKAY!? Can you hear me?</i>
6-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=alarmed,O-oh no! Shimakaze, be safe! Do I need to call you a doctor? Or... er... a mechanic, I suppose?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1=wink,Of course. And you’re definitely not the cute type of ghost, Spooky. Just the scary kind.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1=excited,Of course Spooky! We all know better than to toy with spirits. Er. I at least hope we do.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:aimee=confident,This should be a hint to some of our other companions at the table to part with their weapons.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:lyn,alsoPlayingStage:0=confident,This should be a hint to some of our other companions at the table to part with their weapons.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:revy,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=confident,This should be a hint to some of our other companions at the table to part with their weapons.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=excited,I mean, I have some friends that say I’m pretty quirky… oh! I get it. Superpowers are called Quirks where you’re from, aren’t they?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:daria=excited,I'm glad you think so, Daria! I think Uravity and Ladybug would make a great team!

6-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:daria=embarrassed,Er. Nothing! Uravity! Wust jut wou yer... um... j-just what you were saying! About debris. And stuff.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4=embarrassed,S-so, just stay confident, okay!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=wink,It’s good to see you have an honorable spirit about you. You’re definitely not like Chloe.
6-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=alarmed,Zut, don't make fun of my costume Videl!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=embarrassed,W-wait a second! You aren't supposed to transform as part of a loss! O-or-- D-did I play this wrong?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=alarmed,W-wait! Again!? Y-you have to be using an akuma! I can't transform more than once... And definitely not in such weird ways!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2=alarmed,S-shoot! You are using some kind of evil magic! A-and er. I haven't fed Tikki yet, so this might be a while before I can fix this...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2c=confident,Oh! Well. That was kind of weird, but at least you're in normal clothes now...

6-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a=alarmed,W-what? What is this? M-my earrings are still attached so at least...
6-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a=alarmed,I-I what!? H-how did you? W-what kind of akuma trickery is this!?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:4a=confused,E-excuse you!? How <i>dare</i> you copy my costume, Vriska! This is <i>far</i> worse than Chloe that one time!
6-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1=wink,Do you dye it, or is it natural?
6-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sola=confident,You and Sola know each other, right Zizou? Do all of your friends have such cool hairstyles?
6-female_removed_accessory,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:weiss=alarmed,A doll? Weiss, <i>please</i> don’t make this any weirder.

7-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:daria=confused,Oh, don't be rude, Daria! I'm sure what Ochako does on her knees is-- um... h-her business. (Just play it cool. You can act like nothing was said.)

7-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=calm,So, what'll it be <i>this</i> time, Vriska? Some sort of "wandering martial artist" look?
7-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:0=confused,Yes, Weiss. We know how rich you are. Your father owns a hotel and is a mayor or something, blah blah blah…
7-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:1=wink,Not all wealth is material, Weiss.

7-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:cammy,alsoPlayingStage:3=calm,Wow! She's amazing! Um. I tope hey--hope they don't keep taking off her clothes though...
7-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kimberly,alsoPlayingStage:1=embarrassed,W-well, I-I can hardly blame you. To keep your hair nice. I mean. I tend to like cute, low maintainance stuff.
7-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:zoey,notSaidMarker:boundaries,marker:boundaries=wink,Don’t worry, Zoey, I think everyone’s being very accepting of other’s boundaries. That makes for a good game, right?
7-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy,count-medic:1-3=alarmed,O-oh no! Shimakaze, be safe! Can one of the medics here come treat her? She doesn't seem to be having bad feelings, but... a possessed warship would be awful!
7-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:2,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,count-uravity:1=excited,You're gonna be in great hands with Futaba and Ochako, Saki! Think of this like a girls night out where we talk about boys, and makeup, and um. Getting naked and comfy and stuff!
7-female_removed_accessory,target:red,targetStage:3,count-weapon:2,count-weapon:3=calm,What is with you and Aimee and the others and your weapons? You’re so reliant on things beyond your own wits.

7-female_removed_accessory,target:april,targetStage:1=bored,Oh. Not anymore, huh? Well, the jumpsuit looks nice...
7-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:1=calm,What brings you to a game like this, I wonder? Y-you know, from your storybook? Magic is such an interesting thing...
7-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1=embarrassed,U-um. You’re good at games, right, Blackrose? Let’s just keep playing, don’t get down!
7-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1=embarrassed,I have to say, I don’t know what a GP is. But wherever you’re from, the style is very special!
7-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:alice=embarrassed,Alice, do you think she means pounds? She doesn’t seem to mean Euro or francs…
7-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:rinkah=embarrassed,N-no? Oh. I seem...You just look...I promise I didn’t mean to imply--
7-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:tracer=embarrassed,Um. Did you mean a GBP? I think Tracer knows about that.
7-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:weiss=confused,GP? Does she mean Lien, like you have over in Vale?

7-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=confident,Wow! You handled yourself so well, Cammy. Guess it's a good thing I didn't need to use my yo-yo, huh?
7-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=embarrassed,If so, do you have any particular trophy or device you like to play games with? Just curious, in case I have to free you from Hawk Moth.
7-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=calm,I kind of have to rely on my Miraculous for most of my powers... I'd like to think I'm pretty athletic, but you're next level!
7-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=wink,I may not be the strongest woman in the world, but I'm actually a pretty good fighter, Chun-li!
7-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:2=alarmed,I just wanted to let you know that it's nice to see, you know, someone who's similar to me go so far. You're a big hero to me. E-even though, you know, we're at this game.
7-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:2=alarmed,It's-- I mean, most of the people around me in Paris. Um. Come from a different type of background. But you're a hero worldwide, so you, you know?
7-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=confident,A Lucky Charm, you say? I can definitely relate to that.
7-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=wink,I much prefer ribbons to keep my hair back, but hairbands can definitely be more fashionable for long hair like yours.
7-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2,saidMarker:d.va_competition=wink,We'll just have to see h-how the rest goes, don't we, Hana?
7-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:2=wink,I’d love to try yours, but I’m a one-set kind of girl.
7-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1=alarmed,Y-you're beautiful in your own way, Daria, y-yut boo-- but you don't resemble him!
7-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=bored,O-oh. It was a joke. W-well, maybe that's a profession you should follow-up on, Daria?
7-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:3=confident,You are <i>quite</i> strange, Daria. But in a very likable way! I can see us being great friends!
7-female_removed_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:1=wink,And what's your name? I can't help but feel like there's something darkly magical about you...
7-female_removed_accessory,target:dawn,targetStage:2=embarrassed,I-It’s either already steamy or already chilly, Dawn. I’m not sure which.
7-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=embarrassed,I-it was a pretty bandana, anyway...
7-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=embarrassed,You're really quite foxy, Elaine!
7-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:2=confused,E-er. I think that may translate more sensibly in English...
7-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:1=embarrassed,I-I have to admit, I feel really bad that you didn't choose to be here...
7-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:2=alarmed,A jacquin? What's that? If it's anything like a panther, I really can't say I've had good experiences...
7-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:ann=wink,Is that like a panther of some sort? I bet Ann knows a thing about that.
7-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1=confident,If you ever visit Paris, I'm sure we'd have a great time!
7-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1=confident,That’s the spirit, Florina! Be brave!

7-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=confident,Ladybug is here to keep you safe, Florina! Don’t get too worried!
7-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=confused,I… Hm… You know, I never really considered the option of running away.
7-female_removed_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:1=bored,Your attitude is really bad. Hawk Moth will Akumatize you in no time if you keep being rude.
7-female_removed_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:1=embarrassed,S-sorry, GoGo. I don't know why I'm being so mean... You're being more than a little rude, though...
7-female_removed_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:1=alarmed,K-kinky? J-just because I have a very form fitting costume and a-- You know what, let's not follow this line of thought.
7-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:2=embarrassed,I was about to say...
7-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:5-10=wink,Though, Buffy did already show us how to take her bra off under her clothes...
7-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:moon,alsoPlayingStage:1-10=embarrassed,Though I wouldn’t expect you to mimic her for anything else, I thought maybe Moon might have a trick to pull off that zipless undressing!
7-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:twilight,alsoPlayingStage:1-10=embarrassed,Twilight has, um, however, disregarded normal social conventions. So if you wanted to, Jane, you definitely could?
7-female_removed_accessory,target:kim,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Oh, I definitely would--Um. Is what someone who found you cute would say.
7-female_removed_accessory,target:kim,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Oh! Well if you’re offering--Um. I know magic, Kim! And that’s not a real place!
7-female_removed_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:2=embarrassed,E-er, sorry if that's weird! I just never feel my clothes and kind of have to trust they're just there...
7-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:4=confident,But a hero has to persevere and keep moving forward, no matter what happens.
7-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=alarmed,(Have I been fighting too many akuma? Do I… Um. Do I really just need to find some… <i>release?</i>)
7-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=wink,I <i>may</i> have fantasized about it. Just a bit.
7-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Um... I don't quite know who you are, but I think putting the gun away is a good idea.
7-female_removed_accessory,target:lilith,targetStage:2=wink,Maybe you can show me more later! I mean, of your magic! N-not, but if you wanted to... Um!
7-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:5=alarmed,I-I mean, your taste in fashion. Not... you know…
7-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:2=calm,Or maybe that was Li-Meng, the wizard? Either way, it's exciting to see you here!
7-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,saidMarker:corrin_meia_hair=wink,He certainly manages to make a woman’s hairstyle work, <i>oui</i>, Meia?
7-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:1,saidMarker:corrins_meia_hair,priority:500=confused,The… Er. Boy Corrin.
7-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:2=embarrassed,I-I mean they’re pretty wonderful too, just looking at you. Not you specifically, I mean generally, but you’re nice too, I’m just going to stop now.
7-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=bored,Um. What were those magic words…?
7-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=confident,I guess I'll just have to wait and see!
7-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:2=confused,W-w-wait!? Where'd all the bats come from!?
7-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=excited,I’m glad you don’t get too caught up in your worries, Nagisa!
7-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=embarrassed,It’s just the first round, Nagisa. Don’t worry! E-er, as in  no reason to get down! Not that you’ll--Erk.
7-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:3,marker:coldfloor=confident,You did say you were worried about the floor being cold...It’s okay to be a warm person but sensitive to cold. You dress well for all environments!
7-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:3=excited,I’m sure you have lots of other clothes, but if you wanted to go shopping after this, Nagisa, I’m sure we could find something cute!
7-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=wink,Awww, don't give up! You're just starting to have fun... (<i>You're one to talk, Marinette! You're only here to protect these people, remember that!</i>)
7-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=embarrassed,Natsuki, being a woman is about being proud of who you are and the things you like. If ~player~ is the right person for you, they'll just appreciate you more! Um. The personality. Less the encroaching nudity...
7-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1=calm,Hmm... Well, it's nice to have such a powerful Oracle here with me today! Let's keep an eye out for the akuma, shall we?
7-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:harped=excited,A magic harp! <i>You</i> must have a Miraculous, right, Naryu? What's your Kwami's name?
7-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2=excited,I'm just happy you're having a good time! It would be a shame if you were the one the akuma was targeting!
7-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:3=embarrassed,E-er... unless you remove your necklaces too. How'd you even get that on...?
7-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Er. I mean. I’m saying it from an aesthetic point of you. Point of view. Not that--Uhm. Back to the game!
7-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1=embarrassed,B-but you’re definitely still a goddess and I don’t mean to imply anything too torward fowards you. Forward towards you!
7-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=excited,Oh! It’s magic too? And fine gold? It’s a little gaudy, to be honest, but if it keeps people safe!
7-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=embarrassed,W-well normally I’d say it’s how you present yourself, but I think it’d be rude to say a goddess’s… Assets aren’t something heavenly!
7-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:4=bored,Hmm, lots of belts, Palutena. What are you trying so hard to keep secret?
7-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=confident,Hmm...Palutena, Corrin might use the most tactical choice, but fashion requires a certain economy. I’d be happy to help, as a hero to a goddess of heroes.
7-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:sei=embarrassed,Just fiven that your stuff is gorn fitting, I mean form fitting! Given form fitting! Erk. Both of you… Belts, right?
7-female_removed_accessory,target:pearl,targetStage:1=excited,This is going to be a lot more interesting than I thought! I-I mean, not you specifically Pearl b-but...

7-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=wink,I'm kind of a dork with how into pink I actually am. I bet you'd look really good in it too! Though your tie matched your glasses and eyes in a really cool way!
7-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=wink,I'm kind of interested to see what you'd look like with a nice fluffy scarf. It's doesn't match as well as your tie, but I bet it'd be really comforting.
7-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=alarmed,I-I mean your panties looked fretty passionable to me-- O-oh erm. Pretty fashionable. A-and you were talking about your shoes. Erk. O-okay then.
7-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=alarmed,I thought those panties looked fretty passionable though! I-I mean, um. Pretty fashionable. W-wait, you were talking about your shoes?

7-female_removed_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Well, I guess we don't have to worry about that tonight...

7-female_removed_accessory,target:seven,targetStage:1=wink,Even if I’m going to get naked, there’s one accessory I won’t ever remove, Seven. Maybe that symbol would be the same for you?
7-female_removed_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:1=excited,No…? Weird, I had a feeling… Let me try again…
7-female_removed_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:2=confused,You sound <i>so</i> familiar! I can’t quite pin down why!

7-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1=wink,Of course. And you’re definitely not the cute type of ghost, Spooky. Just the scary kind.
7-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1=excited,Of course Spooky! We all know better than to toy with spirits. Er. I at least hope we do.

-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1=wink,Sometimes you lose a few hands, Sheena. Don’t worry. I’ll make sure you stay safe. From one spirit person to another.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:3=alarmed,Y-you know, maybe this can wait until after the game. Don't you use card-like seals? You're a bit... behind right now.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=alarmed,W-what? A-are you okay?! Someone get a fire extinguisher!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Your rudders... I'm not sure if you've been Akumatized, or this is a Miraculous, or something stranger...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Oh no, not <i>again!</i> Shimakaze, are you okay?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=alarmed,Spooky? Give me the knife, please. Let’s put away our weapons.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:tracer=wink,It’d be nice to do that with you once I get my clothes back on, and a trip to London besides!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=confident,That’s super cool! Do you have a Miraculous or is this kind of power innate to you?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:daria=embarrassed,Godzilla? Oh, if it's a big enemy, I'd probably try to evacuate an area, then figure out what part of him was Akumatized.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=confused,Er. I can owl you chocolate-- call you Ochako, right?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:daria=confused,Oh, don't be rude, Daria! I'm sure what Ochako does on her knees is-- um... h-her business. (Just play it cool. You can act like nothing was said.)
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=alarmed,That lets him give people superpowers but also brings out their worst feelings.

-3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1b,alsoPlaying:futaba=excited,I mean <i>Alya</i> got Akumatized into a cyber-villain. If I could save her, beating you--er, saving you--should be easy!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1a=wink,At least that was a cool outfit. Definitely not stolen. *Cough* Pot *cough* meet *cough* kettle *cough*.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1b=confident,Say, Futaba, is Vriska's outfit like that Tron movie? Could you help me out with this?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1c=wink,Though maybe you have the Lion Miraculous, given how overconfident and prideful you're acting.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2a=wink,Looks like you've been plundered, Vriska.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b=embarrassed,E-er, I'm <i>definitely</i> not into the whole maid thing, so I'm hoping whatever comes next is... A bit better.

-3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=calm,So, what'll it be <i>this</i> time, Vriska? Some sort of "goddess of <i>luck</i>" outfit?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=calm,So, what'll it be <i>this</i> time, Vriska? Some sort of "wandering martial artist" look?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:0=confused,Yes, Weiss. We know how rich you are. Your father owns a hotel and is a mayor or something, blah blah blah…

-3-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:zoey,notSaidMarker:boundaries,marker:boundaries=wink,Don’t worry, Zoey, I think everyone’s being very accepting of other’s boundaries. That makes for a good game, right?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy,count-medic:1-3=alarmed,O-oh no! Shimakaze, be safe! Can one of the medics here come treat her? She doesn't seem to be having bad feelings, but... a possessed warship would be awful!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:2,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,count-uravity:1=excited,You're gonna be in great hands with Futaba and Ochako, Saki! Think of this like a girls night out where we talk about boys, and makeup, and um. Getting naked and comfy and stuff!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:red,targetStage:3,count-weapon:2,count-weapon:3=calm,What is with you and Aimee and the others and your weapons? You’re so reliant on things beyond your own wits.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:1=confident,Wow! You're super animated too! You're awesome, Alpha!

-3-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1=embarrassed,U-um. You’re good at games, right, Blackrose? Let’s just keep playing, don’t get down!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1=embarrassed,I have to say, I don’t know what a GP is. But wherever you’re from, the style is very special!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:alice=embarrassed,Alice, do you think she means pounds? She doesn’t seem to mean Euro or francs…
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:rinkah=embarrassed,N-no? Oh. I seem...You just look...I promise I didn’t mean to imply--
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:tracer=embarrassed,Um. Did you mean a GBP? I think Tracer knows about that.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:weiss=confused,GP? Does she mean Lien, like you have over in Vale?

-3-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=confident,Wow! You handled yourself so well, Cammy. Guess it's a good thing I didn't need to use my yo-yo, huh?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=embarrassed,If so, do you have any particular trophy or device you like to play games with? Just curious, in case I have to free you from Hawk Moth.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=calm,I kind of have to rely on my Miraculous for most of my powers... I'd like to think I'm pretty athletic, but you're next level!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=wink,I may not be the strongest woman in the world, but I'm actually a pretty good fighter, Chun-li!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:2=alarmed,I just wanted to let you know that it's nice to see, you know, someone who's similar to me go so far. You're a big hero to me. E-even though, you know, we're at this game.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:2=alarmed,It's-- I mean, most of the people around me in Paris. Um. Come from a different type of background. But you're a hero worldwide, so you, you know?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=confident,A Lucky Charm, you say? I can definitely relate to that.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=wink,I much prefer ribbons to keep my hair back, but hairbands can definitely be more fashionable for long hair like yours.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2,saidMarker:d.va_competition=wink,We'll just have to see h-how the rest goes, don't we, Hana?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:2=wink,I’d love to try yours, but I’m a one-set kind of girl.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1=alarmed,Y-you're beautiful in your own way, Daria, y-yut boo-- but you don't resemble him!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=bored,O-oh. It was a joke. W-well, maybe that's a profession you should follow-up on, Daria?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:3=confident,You are <i>quite</i> strange, Daria. But in a very likable way! I can see us being great friends!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:1=wink,And what's your name? I can't help but feel like there's something darkly magical about you...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:dawn,targetStage:2=embarrassed,I-It’s either already steamy or already chilly, Dawn. I’m not sure which.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=embarrassed,I-it was a pretty bandana, anyway...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=embarrassed,You're really quite foxy, Elaine!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:2=confused,E-er. I think that may translate more sensibly in English...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:1=embarrassed,I-I have to admit, I feel really bad that you didn't choose to be here...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Elena, could you be a bit more magnanimous and lose faster?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:2=alarmed,U-uhm. I can feel the wind near something, Elena.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:ann=wink,A-Ann, do you know anything about big cats like that? Because there's a lot of... cats here...

-3-female_removed_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:1=bored,Your attitude is really bad. Hawk Moth will Akumatize you in no time if you keep being rude.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:1=embarrassed,S-sorry, GoGo. I don't know why I'm being so mean... You're being more than a little rude, though...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:1=alarmed,K-kinky? J-just because I have a very form fitting costume and a-- You know what, let's not follow this line of thought.

-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:buffy,alsoPlayingStage:5-10=wink,Though, Buffy did already show us how to take her bra off under her clothes...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:moon,alsoPlayingStage:1-10=embarrassed,Though I wouldn’t expect you to mimic her for anything else, I thought maybe Moon might have a trick to pull off that zipless undressing!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:twilight,alsoPlayingStage:1-10=embarrassed,Twilight has, um, however, disregarded normal social conventions. So if you wanted to, Jane, you definitely could?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:kim,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Oh, I definitely would--Um. Is what someone who found you cute would say.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:kim,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Oh! Well if you’re offering--Um. I know magic, Kim! And that’s not a real place!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:2=embarrassed,E-er, sorry if that's weird! I just never feel my clothes and kind of have to trust they're just there...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:4=confident,But a hero has to persevere and keep moving forward, no matter what happens.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=alarmed,(Have I been fighting too many akuma? Do I… Um. Do I really just need to find some… <i>release?</i>)
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=wink,I <i>may</i> have fantasized about it. Just a bit.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:gwen=wink,I think the fantasy is a little better than reality, but the reality isn’t bad. In moderation.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Um... I don't quite know who you are, but I think putting the gun away is a good idea.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:lilith,targetStage:2=wink,Maybe you can show me more later! I mean, of your magic! N-not, but if you wanted to... Um!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:5=alarmed,I-I mean, your taste in fashion. Not... you know…
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:2=calm,Or maybe that was Li-Meng, the wizard? Either way, it's exciting to see you here!

-3-female_removed_accessory,target:moon,targetStage:4=bored,Um. What were those magic words…?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=confident,I guess I'll just have to wait and see!

-3-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=excited,I’m glad you don’t get too caught up in your worries, Nagisa!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=embarrassed,It’s just the first round, Nagisa. Don’t worry! E-er, as in  no reason to get down! Not that you’ll--Erk.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:3,marker:coldfloor=confident,You did say you were worried about the floor being cold...It’s okay to be a warm person but sensitive to cold. You dress well for all environments!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:3=excited,I’m sure you have lots of other clothes, but if you wanted to go shopping after this, Nagisa, I’m sure we could find something cute!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=wink,Awww, don't give up! You're just starting to have fun... (<i>You're one to talk, Marinette! You're only here to protect these people, remember that!</i>)
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=embarrassed,Natsuki, being a woman is about being proud of who you are and the things you like. If ~player~ is the right person for you, they'll just appreciate you more! Um. The personality. Less the encroaching nudity...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1=calm,Hmm... Well, it's nice to have such a powerful Oracle here with me today! Let's keep an eye out for the akuma, shall we?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:harped=excited,A magic harp! <i>You</i> must have a Miraculous, right, Naryu? What's your Kwami's name?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2=excited,I'm just happy you're having a good time! It would be a shame if you were the one the akuma was targeting!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:3=embarrassed,E-er... unless you remove your necklaces too. How'd you even get that on...?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Er. I mean. I’m saying it from an aesthetic point of you. Point of view. Not that--Uhm. Back to the game!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1=embarrassed,B-but you’re definitely still a goddess and I don’t mean to imply anything too torward fowards you. Forward towards you!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=excited,Oh! It’s magic too? And fine gold? It’s a little gaudy, to be honest, but if it keeps people safe!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=embarrassed,W-well normally I’d say it’s how you present yourself, but I think it’d be rude to say a goddess’s… Assets aren’t something heavenly!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:4=bored,Hmm, lots of belts, Palutena. What are you trying so hard to keep secret?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=confident,Hmm...Palutena, Corrin might use the most tactical choice, but fashion requires a certain economy. I’d be happy to help, as a hero to a goddess of heroes.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:sei=embarrassed,Just fiven that your stuff is gorn fitting, I mean form fitting! Given form fitting! Erk. Both of you… Belts, right?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:pearl,targetStage:1=excited,This is going to be a lot more interesting than I thought! I-I mean, not you specifically Pearl b-but...

-3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=wink,I'm kind of a dork with how into pink I actually am. I bet you'd look really good in it too! Though your tie matched your glasses and eyes in a really cool way!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=wink,I'm kind of interested to see what you'd look like with a nice fluffy scarf. It's doesn't match as well as your tie, but I bet it'd be really comforting.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=alarmed,I-I mean your panties looked fretty passionable to me-- O-oh erm. Pretty fashionable. A-and you were talking about your shoes. Erk. O-okay then.

-3-female_removed_accessory,target:seven,targetStage:1=wink,Even if I’m going to get naked, there’s one accessory I won’t ever remove, Seven. Maybe that symbol would be the same for you?

-2-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei=excited,Oh! You and Sei have something in common, with all of your belts. I’m surprised, given that they don’t seem to be keeping anything loose down.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:pearl,targetStage:0=alarmed,Whoa! I'm the only one who's supposed to transform!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:red,targetStage:0=embarrassed,I think this is, a, um. Bad idea. My yo-yo doesn’t count!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:red,targetStage:2=wink,Um. Exposed. Maybe it’s time for you to put away that sword?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=bored,Er... won't you at least part with your guns...?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=confused,N-no...? Er... I've yet to solve a problem that needed a gun...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=confident,Costume aside, I'm more of a fan of pink than red. A pink ladybug would look kind of weird, don't you think?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:red=embarrassed,Costume aside, I'm more of a fan of pink than red. E-er. N-not the Red here, I mean like the color! Kind of like Red's red hair!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=embarrassed,W-well, it's nice to see you like pink stuff too, Saki. B-but you're-- you're flashing us!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba,saidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba=confident,We should take care of Saki somehow! We don't want her to get Akumatized or feel ashamed!

-2-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:0=excited,They say you can stand up to any challenge, no matter however demanding, and that your courage is amazing and…
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=calm,Hmm... Yeah, that's a good question. It's not like my costume really ever gets damaged...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=confident,Agreed. Capes aren’t quite as good as a heavy cloak. But there’s something debonair about it!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=confused,Um. I don't mean to be critical, but the belts for your belts look is a bit too recent to be vintage...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=embarrassed,U-uhm. Are you sober enough to be playing, Sei? I'd hate for you to regret this.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=confident,I don’t want another Rogercop. It looks like you’re almost pre-loaded for that kind of thing…
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:0=bored,Hm… Are you a swordswoman seeking redemption? Maybe you have a broken sword of some sort?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Ah, <i>zut</i>, the purple hair made me imagine…
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:2=confident,That famous fashion company some girl managed to destroy?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:ryuko=wink,The one that Ryuko has some history with, right?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sharla,targetStage:0=bored,Are you... wait... no... that's not right...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sharla,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:shazza=embarrassed,Oh! You're Shazza, right! W-wait...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1=confident,Don’t be so hard on yourself! Dealing with spirits is really challenging, and you do that really well!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1=wink,Sometimes you lose a few hands, Sheena. Don’t worry. I’ll make sure you stay safe. From one spirit person to another.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:3=alarmed,Y-you know, maybe this can wait until after the game. Don't you use card-like seals? You're a bit... behind right now.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=alarmed,W-what? A-are you okay?! Someone get a fire extinguisher!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Your rudders... I'm not sure if you've been Akumatized, or this is a Miraculous, or something stranger...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Oh no, not <i>again!</i> Shimakaze, are you okay?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=alarmed,Spooky? Give me the knife, please. Let’s put away our weapons.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=confident,That’s super cool! Do you have a Miraculous or is this kind of power innate to you?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:daria=embarrassed,Godzilla? Oh, if it's a big enemy, I'd probably try to evacuate an area, then figure out what part of him was Akumatized.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=confused,Er. I can owl you chocolate-- call you Ochako, right?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:daria=confused,Oh, don't be rude, Daria! I'm sure what Ochako does on her knees is-- um... h-her business. (Just play it cool. You can act like nothing was said.)
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=alarmed,That lets him give people superpowers but also brings out their worst feelings.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=confident,I’m glad to see the senzu bean grows far from the vine, Videl!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=alarmed,H-hey! What are you doing!? Are you copying my Miraculous?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=embarrassed,What magic is this?! Did you have a Miraculous this whole time!?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=confident,Whoa! You're going to detransform too right--
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1b,alsoPlaying:futaba=excited,I mean <i>Alya</i> got Akumatized into a cyber-villain. If I could save her, beating you--er, saving you--should be easy!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1a=wink,At least that was a cool outfit. Definitely not stolen. *Cough* Pot *cough* meet *cough* kettle *cough*.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1b=confident,Say, Futaba, is Vriska's outfit like that Tron movie? Could you help me out with this?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1c=wink,Though maybe you have the Lion Miraculous, given how overconfident and prideful you're acting.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2a=wink,Looks like you've been plundered, Vriska.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b=embarrassed,E-er, I'm <i>definitely</i> not into the whole maid thing, so I'm hoping whatever comes next is... A bit better.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2c=embarrassed,At least you finally settled on some casualwear... Why are you transforming again?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=calm,So, what'll it be <i>this</i> time, Vriska? Some sort of "goddess of <i>luck</i>" outfit?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=calm,So, what'll it be <i>this</i> time, Vriska? Some sort of "wandering martial artist" look?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:0=confused,Yes, Weiss. We know how rich you are. Your father owns a hotel and is a mayor or something, blah blah blah…
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:1=wink,Not all wealth is material, Weiss.

-2-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:0=excited,And your hair does look pretty! It’s a very cool texture and color.
-2-female_removed_accessory=calm,Take it slow... I want to enjoy this.
-2-female_removed_accessory=embarrassed,Is it weird that I can fantasize about your outfit? No weirder than this, I suppose.
-2-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:cammy,alsoPlayingStage:3=calm,Wow! She's amazing! Um. I tope hey--hope they don't keep taking off her clothes though...
-2-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kimberly,alsoPlayingStage:1=embarrassed,W-well, I-I can hardly blame you. To keep your hair nice. I mean. I tend to like cute, low maintainance stuff.
-2-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:zoey,notSaidMarker:boundaries,marker:boundaries=wink,Don’t worry, Zoey, I think everyone’s being very accepting of other’s boundaries. That makes for a good game, right?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy,count-medic:1-3=alarmed,O-oh no! Shimakaze, be safe! Can one of the medics here come treat her? She doesn't seem to be having bad feelings, but... a possessed warship would be awful!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:2,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,count-uravity:1=excited,You're gonna be in great hands with Futaba and Ochako, Saki! Think of this like a girls night out where we talk about boys, and makeup, and um. Getting naked and comfy and stuff!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:red,targetStage:3,count-weapon:2,count-weapon:3=calm,What is with you and Aimee and the others and your weapons? You’re so reliant on things beyond your own wits.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:1=confident,Wow! You're super animated too! You're awesome, Alpha!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:3=confident,You know, I did do a cover... Of the artistic variety! I'm not a great singer... For Jagged Stone. Maybe I could do one for you too?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:4=confident,Hmm... Okay, Alpha, can you do... Born to be Free, by X Japan?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:amy_rose,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Oh! It's not a Miraculous. You're just like this!

-2-female_removed_accessory,target:april,targetStage:1=bored,Oh. Not anymore, huh? Well, the jumpsuit looks nice...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:1=calm,What brings you to a game like this, I wonder? Y-you know, from your storybook? Magic is such an interesting thing...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1=embarrassed,U-um. You’re good at games, right, Blackrose? Let’s just keep playing, don’t get down!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1=embarrassed,I have to say, I don’t know what a GP is. But wherever you’re from, the style is very special!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:alice=embarrassed,Alice, do you think she means pounds? She doesn’t seem to mean Euro or francs…
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:rinkah=embarrassed,N-no? Oh. I seem...You just look...I promise I didn’t mean to imply--
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:tracer=embarrassed,Um. Did you mean a GBP? I think Tracer knows about that.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:weiss=confused,GP? Does she mean Lien, like you have over in Vale?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:1=alarmed,Finger on! I-I would never unless you really wanted me to b-but-
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=confident,Huh, so that’s your secret! I have a weird feeling about Cat Noir right now…

-2-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=confident,Wow! You handled yourself so well, Cammy. Guess it's a good thing I didn't need to use my yo-yo, huh?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=embarrassed,If so, do you have any particular trophy or device you like to play games with? Just curious, in case I have to free you from Hawk Moth.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=calm,I kind of have to rely on my Miraculous for most of my powers... I'd like to think I'm pretty athletic, but you're next level!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=wink,I may not be the strongest woman in the world, but I'm actually a pretty good fighter, Chun-li!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:2=alarmed,I just wanted to let you know that it's nice to see, you know, someone who's similar to me go so far. You're a big hero to me. E-even though, you know, we're at this game.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:2=alarmed,It's-- I mean, most of the people around me in Paris. Um. Come from a different type of background. But you're a hero worldwide, so you, you know?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=confident,A Lucky Charm, you say? I can definitely relate to that.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=wink,I much prefer ribbons to keep my hair back, but hairbands can definitely be more fashionable for long hair like yours.

-2-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:2=wink,I’d love to try yours, but I’m a one-set kind of girl.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1=alarmed,Y-you're beautiful in your own way, Daria, y-yut boo-- but you don't resemble him!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=bored,O-oh. It was a joke. W-well, maybe that's a profession you should follow-up on, Daria?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:3=confident,You are <i>quite</i> strange, Daria. But in a very likable way! I can see us being great friends!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:1=wink,And what's your name? I can't help but feel like there's something darkly magical about you...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:dawn,targetStage:2=embarrassed,I-It’s either already steamy or already chilly, Dawn. I’m not sure which.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=embarrassed,I-it was a pretty bandana, anyway...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=embarrassed,You're really quite foxy, Elaine!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:2=confused,E-er. I think that may translate more sensibly in English...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:1=embarrassed,I-I have to admit, I feel really bad that you didn't choose to be here...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Elena, could you be a bit more magnanimous and lose faster?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:2=alarmed,U-uhm. I can feel the wind near something, Elena.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:ann=wink,A-Ann, do you know anything about big cats like that? Because there's a lot of... cats here...

-2-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=confused,I… Hm… You know, I never really considered the option of running away.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:1=bored,Your attitude is really bad. Hawk Moth will Akumatize you in no time if you keep being rude.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:1=embarrassed,S-sorry, GoGo. I don't know why I'm being so mean... You're being more than a little rude, though...

-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:moon,alsoPlayingStage:1-10=embarrassed,Though I wouldn’t expect you to mimic her for anything else, I thought maybe Moon might have a trick to pull off that zipless undressing!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:twilight,alsoPlayingStage:1-10=embarrassed,Twilight has, um, however, disregarded normal social conventions. So if you wanted to, Jane, you definitely could?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:kim,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Oh, I definitely would--Um. Is what someone who found you cute would say.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:kim,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Oh! Well if you’re offering--Um. I know magic, Kim! And that’s not a real place!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:2=embarrassed,E-er, sorry if that's weird! I just never feel my clothes and kind of have to trust they're just there...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=alarmed,(Have I been fighting too many akuma? Do I… Um. Do I really just need to find some… <i>release?</i>)
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=wink,I <i>may</i> have fantasized about it. Just a bit.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:gwen=wink,I think the fantasy is a little better than reality, but the reality isn’t bad. In moderation.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Um... I don't quite know who you are, but I think putting the gun away is a good idea.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:lilith,targetStage:2=wink,Maybe you can show me more later! I mean, of your magic! N-not, but if you wanted to... Um!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:5=alarmed,I-I mean, your taste in fashion. Not... you know…
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:2=calm,Or maybe that was Li-Meng, the wizard? Either way, it's exciting to see you here!

-2-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=embarrassed,Natsuki, being a woman is about being proud of who you are and the things you like. If ~player~ is the right person for you, they'll just appreciate you more! Um. The personality. Less the encroaching nudity...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1=calm,Hmm... Well, it's nice to have such a powerful Oracle here with me today! Let's keep an eye out for the akuma, shall we?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:harped=excited,A magic harp! <i>You</i> must have a Miraculous, right, Naryu? What's your Kwami's name?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2=excited,I'm just happy you're having a good time! It would be a shame if you were the one the akuma was targeting!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:3=embarrassed,E-er... unless you remove your necklaces too. How'd you even get that on...?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Er. I mean. I’m saying it from an aesthetic point of you. Point of view. Not that--Uhm. Back to the game!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1=embarrassed,B-but you’re definitely still a goddess and I don’t mean to imply anything too torward fowards you. Forward towards you!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=excited,Oh! It’s magic too? And fine gold? It’s a little gaudy, to be honest, but if it keeps people safe!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=embarrassed,W-well normally I’d say it’s how you present yourself, but I think it’d be rude to say a goddess’s… Assets aren’t something heavenly!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:4=bored,Hmm, lots of belts, Palutena. What are you trying so hard to keep secret?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=confident,Hmm...Palutena, Corrin might use the most tactical choice, but fashion requires a certain economy. I’d be happy to help, as a hero to a goddess of heroes.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:sei=embarrassed,Just fiven that your stuff is gorn fitting, I mean form fitting! Given form fitting! Erk. Both of you… Belts, right?

-2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=wink,I'm kind of a dork with how into pink I actually am. I bet you'd look really good in it too! Though your tie matched your glasses and eyes in a really cool way!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=wink,I'm kind of interested to see what you'd look like with a nice fluffy scarf. It's doesn't match as well as your tie, but I bet it'd be really comforting.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=alarmed,I-I mean your panties looked fretty passionable to me-- O-oh erm. Pretty fashionable. A-and you were talking about your shoes. Erk. O-okay then.

-1-female_removing_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:4=excited,All of your things are so finely made, I could learn a lot based on your taste!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:1=embarrassed,I've actually heard a lot about you! How you got lost in a Blizzard once...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f,saidMarker:corrin_meia_hair,priority:500,marker:corrins_meia_hair=embarrassed,The… Er. Boy Corrin.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_m,saidMarker:corrin_meia_hair=embarrassed,Um. You and him… Pull it off really well! You know. For something so… Universal!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:1=calm,Mercy, Switzerland has lots of things I find super interesting. The fashion, the languages, and the baking are all wonderful! And the people...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=embarrassed,I know an Akumatized person when I see one... But I'm not sure I can see an accessory...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=excited,In Japan, you have multiple pairs of shoes for school, for your house, and outside, right? That must be nice to have so many opportunities to express yourself!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:0=confident,They’re nice shoes, Nagisa! The style seems maybe a year or two out of date, though.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=embarrassed,O-oh, sorry. I can look away if you’d like?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=alarmed,Oh! I’m sorry, Nagisa. It’s just a very cool jacket!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=confident,Oh! Your shoes and socks at the same time! I was worried over nothing. You're pretty brave, aren't you?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=confused,But you <i>are</i> really cute.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0=bored,Though um, based on your ears, you're not really from around France, are you?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1=bored,Fortunately, um, it looks like you don't really need to rewind since it's just your sandals...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2=confident,At least you have two rounds of small stuff left!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:neo,targetStage:1=excited,So Neopolitan like the ice cream... and you’re short. Oh you’re pint-sized! I get it!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=confused,Webmaster? Have I fought that villain before…?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=confident,You are well adorned! Both in accessories and otherwise.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=wink,Those are really cool armbands. I’m glad my costume normally works as armor, though. That seems a lot heavier. It’s such a relief to see you lose them, though.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:2=wink,Gracious of you to include the part actually keeping that on, Palutena.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:2=confident,Third time’s the charm, it just doesn’t seem to be a lucky one for you.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=confident,Belts? Oh! You’re rocking the “many belts” look. Befitting of a goddess.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3=wink,Why limit yourself to conventional aesthetics, Palutena?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:sei=excited,Oh! You and Sei have something in common, with all of your belts. I’m surprised, given that they don’t seem to be keeping anything loose down.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:pearl,targetStage:0=alarmed,Whoa! I'm the only one who's supposed to transform!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:red,targetStage:0=embarrassed,I think this is, a, um. Bad idea. My yo-yo doesn’t count!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:red,targetStage:2=wink,Um. Exposed. Maybe it’s time for you to put away that sword?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=bored,Er... won't you at least part with your guns...?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=confused,N-no...? Er... I've yet to solve a problem that needed a gun...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=confident,Costume aside, I'm more of a fan of pink than red. A pink ladybug would look kind of weird, don't you think?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:red=embarrassed,Costume aside, I'm more of a fan of pink than red. E-er. N-not the Red here, I mean like the color! Kind of like Red's red hair!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=embarrassed,W-well, it's nice to see you like pink stuff too, Saki. B-but you're-- you're flashing us!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba,saidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba=confident,We should take care of Saki somehow! We don't want her to get Akumatized or feel ashamed!

-1-female_removing_accessory,target:samus,targetStage:0=excited,They say you can stand up to any challenge, no matter however demanding, and that your courage is amazing and…
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sayaka,targetStage:0=calm,Hmm... Yeah, that's a good question. It's not like my costume really ever gets damaged...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:scarlet_witch,targetStage:0=confident,Agreed. Capes aren’t quite as good as a heavy cloak. But there’s something debonair about it!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=confused,Um. I don't mean to be critical, but the belts for your belts look is a bit too recent to be vintage...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=embarrassed,U-uhm. Are you sober enough to be playing, Sei? I'd hate for you to regret this.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:2=confident,I don’t want another Rogercop. It looks like you’re almost pre-loaded for that kind of thing…
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:0=bored,Hm… Are you a swordswoman seeking redemption? Maybe you have a broken sword of some sort?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Ah, <i>zut</i>, the purple hair made me imagine…
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:2=confident,That famous fashion company some girl managed to destroy?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:shantae,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:ryuko=wink,The one that Ryuko has some history with, right?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sharla,targetStage:0=bored,Are you... wait... no... that's not right...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sharla,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:shazza=embarrassed,Oh! You're Shazza, right! W-wait...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1=confident,Don’t be so hard on yourself! Dealing with spirits is really challenging, and you do that really well!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:1=wink,Sometimes you lose a few hands, Sheena. Don’t worry. I’ll make sure you stay safe. From one spirit person to another.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sheena,targetStage:3=alarmed,Y-you know, maybe this can wait until after the game. Don't you use card-like seals? You're a bit... behind right now.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=alarmed,W-what? A-are you okay?! Someone get a fire extinguisher!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Your rudders... I'm not sure if you've been Akumatized, or this is a Miraculous, or something stranger...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Oh no, not <i>again!</i> Shimakaze, are you okay?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=alarmed,Spooky? Give me the knife, please. Let’s put away our weapons.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=confident,That’s super cool! Do you have a Miraculous or is this kind of power innate to you?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:daria=embarrassed,Godzilla? Oh, if it's a big enemy, I'd probably try to evacuate an area, then figure out what part of him was Akumatized.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=confused,Er. I can owl you chocolate-- call you Ochako, right?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:daria=confused,Oh, don't be rude, Daria! I'm sure what Ochako does on her knees is-- um... h-her business. (Just play it cool. You can act like nothing was said.)
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=alarmed,That lets him give people superpowers but also brings out their worst feelings.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=confident,I’m glad to see the senzu bean grows far from the vine, Videl!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=alarmed,H-hey! What are you doing!? Are you copying my Miraculous?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=embarrassed,What magic is this?! Did you have a Miraculous this whole time!?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:0=confident,Whoa! You're going to detransform too right--
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1b,alsoPlaying:futaba=excited,I mean <i>Alya</i> got Akumatized into a cyber-villain. If I could save her, beating you--er, saving you--should be easy!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1a=wink,At least that was a cool outfit. Definitely not stolen. *Cough* Pot *cough* meet *cough* kettle *cough*.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1b=confident,Say, Futaba, is Vriska's outfit like that Tron movie? Could you help me out with this?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1c=wink,Though maybe you have the Lion Miraculous, given how overconfident and prideful you're acting.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2a=wink,Looks like you've been plundered, Vriska.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2b=embarrassed,E-er, I'm <i>definitely</i> not into the whole maid thing, so I'm hoping whatever comes next is... A bit better.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:2c=embarrassed,At least you finally settled on some casualwear... Why are you transforming again?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=calm,So, what'll it be <i>this</i> time, Vriska? Some sort of "goddess of <i>luck</i>" outfit?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:3=calm,So, what'll it be <i>this</i> time, Vriska? Some sort of "wandering martial artist" look?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:0=confused,Yes, Weiss. We know how rich you are. Your father owns a hotel and is a mayor or something, blah blah blah…
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:1=wink,Not all wealth is material, Weiss.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:blake=bored,Blake, is Weiss always this… Bourgeois?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:ruby=bored,Yang, is Weiss always like this… Repugnant?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:yang=bored,Yang, is Weiss always this… Yawn-inducing?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:zizou,targetStage:0=excited,And your hair does look pretty! It’s a very cool texture and color.
-1-female_removed_accessory=embarrassed,Still boring, just stickier. I mean damper. Marinette, get ahold of yourself. (Didn’t I just do that, though?)
-1-female_removed_accessory=alarmed,N-not that you should, or I want you too.  I can’t believe I just said that.
-1-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:cammy,alsoPlayingStage:3=calm,Wow! She's amazing! Um. I tope hey--hope they don't keep taking off her clothes though...
-1-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:kimberly,alsoPlayingStage:1=embarrassed,W-well, I-I can hardly blame you. To keep your hair nice. I mean. I tend to like cute, low maintainance stuff.
-1-female_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:zoey,notSaidMarker:boundaries,marker:boundaries=wink,Don’t worry, Zoey, I think everyone’s being very accepting of other’s boundaries. That makes for a good game, right?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy,count-medic:1-3=alarmed,O-oh no! Shimakaze, be safe! Can one of the medics here come treat her? She doesn't seem to be having bad feelings, but... a possessed warship would be awful!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingStage:2,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,count-uravity:1=excited,You're gonna be in great hands with Futaba and Ochako, Saki! Think of this like a girls night out where we talk about boys, and makeup, and um. Getting naked and comfy and stuff!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:red,targetStage:3,count-weapon:2,count-weapon:3=calm,What is with you and Aimee and the others and your weapons? You’re so reliant on things beyond your own wits.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:1=confident,Wow! You're super animated too! You're awesome, Alpha!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:3=confident,You know, I did do a cover... Of the artistic variety! I'm not a great singer... For Jagged Stone. Maybe I could do one for you too?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:4=confident,Hmm... Okay, Alpha, can you do... Born to be Free, by X Japan?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:amy_rose,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Oh! It's not a Miraculous. You're just like this!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:5=alarmed,Because I'm sweet on you! Er. No, I mean, you're a sweetheart.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1=confident,I may be an art student, but that doesn’t mean I’m not clever, Annie! Let's see what you've got!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:futaba,marker:french=bored,What was that, Futaba? <i>Grossier.</i>
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:2=calm,Aren’t you supposed to be the smart one?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:april,targetStage:1=bored,Oh. Not anymore, huh? Well, the jumpsuit looks nice...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen,targetStage:1=calm,What brings you to a game like this, I wonder? Y-you know, from your storybook? Magic is such an interesting thing...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1=embarrassed,U-um. You’re good at games, right, Blackrose? Let’s just keep playing, don’t get down!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1=embarrassed,I have to say, I don’t know what a GP is. But wherever you’re from, the style is very special!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:alice=embarrassed,Alice, do you think she means pounds? She doesn’t seem to mean Euro or francs…
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:rinkah=embarrassed,N-no? Oh. I seem...You just look...I promise I didn’t mean to imply--
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:tracer=embarrassed,Um. Did you mean a GBP? I think Tracer knows about that.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:blackrose,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:weiss=confused,GP? Does she mean Lien, like you have over in Vale?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:1=alarmed,Finger on! I-I would never unless you really wanted me to b-but-
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=confident,Huh, so that’s your secret! I have a weird feeling about Cat Noir right now…

-1-female_removed_accessory,target:buffy,targetStage:4=embarrassed,Drive me crazy as in... aroused... Uhm. Well.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy,targetStage:2=confident,Wow! You handled yourself so well, Cammy. Guess it's a good thing I didn't need to use my yo-yo, huh?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=embarrassed,If so, do you have any particular trophy or device you like to play games with? Just curious, in case I have to free you from Hawk Moth.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=calm,I kind of have to rely on my Miraculous for most of my powers... I'd like to think I'm pretty athletic, but you're next level!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:1=wink,I may not be the strongest woman in the world, but I'm actually a pretty good fighter, Chun-li!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:2=alarmed,I just wanted to let you know that it's nice to see, you know, someone who's similar to me go so far. You're a big hero to me. E-even though, you know, we're at this game.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:chun-li,targetStage:2=alarmed,It's-- I mean, most of the people around me in Paris. Um. Come from a different type of background. But you're a hero worldwide, so you, you know?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=wink,I much prefer ribbons to keep my hair back, but hairbands can definitely be more fashionable for long hair like yours.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2,saidMarker:d.va_competition=wink,We'll just have to see h-how the rest goes, don't we, Hana?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:2=wink,I’d love to try yours, but I’m a one-set kind of girl.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1=alarmed,Y-you're beautiful in your own way, Daria, y-yut boo-- but you don't resemble him!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=bored,O-oh. It was a joke. W-well, maybe that's a profession you should follow-up on, Daria?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:3=confident,You are <i>quite</i> strange, Daria. But in a very likable way! I can see us being great friends!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:1=wink,And what's your name? I can't help but feel like there's something darkly magical about you...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:dawn,targetStage:2=embarrassed,I-It’s either already steamy or already chilly, Dawn. I’m not sure which.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=embarrassed,I-it was a pretty bandana, anyway...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:1=embarrassed,You're really quite foxy, Elaine!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:elaine,targetStage:2=confused,E-er. I think that may translate more sensibly in English...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:1=embarrassed,I-I have to admit, I feel really bad that you didn't choose to be here
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Elena, could you be a bit more magnanimous and lose faster?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:2=alarmed,U-uhm. I can feel the wind near something, Elena.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:elena,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:ann=wink,A-Ann, do you know anything about big cats like that? Because there's a lot of... cats here...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:elizabeth,targetStage:1=confident,If you ever visit Paris, I'm sure we'd have a great time!

-1-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=confident,Ladybug is here to keep you safe, Florina! Don’t get too worried!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=confused,I… Hm… You know, I never really considered the option of running away.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:1=bored,Your attitude is really bad. Hawk Moth will Akumatize you in no time if you keep being rude.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:1=embarrassed,S-sorry, GoGo. I don't know why I'm being so mean... You're being more than a little rude, though...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:gogo,targetStage:1=alarmed,K-kinky? J-just because I have a very form fitting costume and a-- You know what, let's not follow this line of thought.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:2=embarrassed,I was about to say...

-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:moon,alsoPlayingStage:1-10=embarrassed,Though I wouldn’t expect you to mimic her for anything else, I thought maybe Moon might have a trick to pull off that zipless undressing!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jane,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:twilight,alsoPlayingStage:1-10=embarrassed,Twilight has, um, however, disregarded normal social conventions. So if you wanted to, Jane, you definitely could?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:kim,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Oh, I definitely would--Um. Is what someone who found you cute would say.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:kim,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Oh! Well if you’re offering--Um. I know magic, Kim! And that’s not a real place!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:kimberly,targetStage:2=embarrassed,E-er, sorry if that's weird! I just never feel my clothes and kind of have to trust they're just there...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:korra,targetStage:4=confident,But a hero has to persevere and keep moving forward, no matter what happens.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=alarmed,(Have I been fighting too many akuma? Do I… Um. Do I really just need to find some… <i>release?</i>)
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=wink,I <i>may</i> have fantasized about it. Just a bit.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:gwen=wink,I think the fantasy is a little better than reality, but the reality isn’t bad. In moderation.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Um... I don't quite know who you are, but I think putting the gun away is a good idea.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:lilith,targetStage:2=wink,Maybe you can show me more later! I mean, of your magic! N-not, but if you wanted to... Um!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:lyn,targetStage:5=alarmed,I-I mean, your taste in fashion. Not... you know…
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mei,targetStage:2=calm,Or maybe that was Li-Meng, the wizard? Either way, it's exciting to see you here!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:meia,saidMarker:corrin_meia_hair=wink,He certainly manages to make a woman’s hairstyle work, <i>oui</i>, Meia?

-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mercy,targetStage:2=embarrassed,I-I mean they’re pretty wonderful too, just looking at you. Not you specifically, I mean generally, but you’re nice too, I’m just going to stop now.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=confident,I guess I'll just have to wait and see!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:2=confused,W-w-wait!? Where'd all the bats come from!?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=excited,I’m glad you don’t get too caught up in your worries, Nagisa!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=embarrassed,It’s just the first round, Nagisa. Don’t worry! E-er, as in  no reason to get down! Not that you’ll--Erk.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:3,marker:coldfloor=confident,You did say you were worried about the floor being cold...It’s okay to be a warm person but sensitive to cold. You dress well for all environments!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:nagisa,targetStage:3=excited,I’m sure you have lots of other clothes, but if you wanted to go shopping after this, Nagisa, I’m sure we could find something cute!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=wink,Awww, don't give up! You're just starting to have fun... (<i>You're one to talk, Marinette! You're only here to protect these people, remember that!</i>)
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=embarrassed,Natsuki, being a woman is about being proud of who you are and the things you like. If ~player~ is the right person for you, they'll just appreciate you more! Um. The personality. Less the encroaching nudity...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1=calm,Hmm... Well, it's nice to have such a powerful Oracle here with me today! Let's keep an eye out for the akuma, shall we?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:harped=excited,A magic harp! <i>You</i> must have a Miraculous, right, Naryu? What's your Kwami's name?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:2=excited,I'm just happy you're having a good time! It would be a shame if you were the one the akuma was targeting!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:3=embarrassed,E-er... unless you remove your necklaces too. How'd you even get that on...?

0-female_removing_minor,target:sanako,targetStage:0=calm,(Hmm... she seems oddly familiar...)
0-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=confused,A "soul gem?" Hmm... is that where you store your guardian spirit to transform?
0-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=calm,Hmm... Well, I guess there's other types of heroes out there... other types of girls with magic too, I suppose!
0-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:0=calm,I'm glad Sayori is so excitable! Even if she's a bit spacy.
0-female_removing_minor,target:shego,targetStage:0=confident,You may not use an akuma, but I'll stop you anyway!
0-female_removing_minor,target:shego,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei=confident,Sei, can you just arrest Shego? I’d like to see her tied up. I-I mean behind bars.
0-female_removing_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=alarmed,F-flooding? <i>D-de l'eau dans vos chaussette?</i> Um... I-is this a euphemism?
0-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=wink,This whole thing's a little awkward but let’s try to stay calm and collected, okay?
0-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=alarmed,Um. I can't say I've ever had to worry about it. Sometimes afterwards, but never during! I guess it's a side effect of my Miraculous?
0-female_removing_minor,target:weiss,targetStage:2=wink,Not that anyone here seems to care about your money but you.
0-female_removed_minor=wink,Alya'd probably love to compare notes. You really, really know how to own your apparel!
0-female_removed_minor=calm,Maybe you’d prefer being a model to being a player?
0-female_removed_minor=embarrassed,Well, at least I know you’re not going to be so ashamed Hawk Moth can evilize you.
0-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:crash,notSaidMarker:pegasusquish=confident,W-what? You can fly on a pegasus! That’s incredible, Florina! A-and sorry, ~name~, about your ~clothing~. And spine.
0-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:sonya,alsoPlayingStage:6,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:commando=embarrassed,Whoa, Sonya. That's... Wow, body paint. I didn't think I was into this. I guess I am, though.

0-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:6,marker:ztentacles=confident,I’m sure, even faced with a tentacle monster, ~name~ would hold her ground, Zone! No wardrobe destruction. Or. Um. Destruction of orifices.
0-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=bored,Erm, Aimee... This seems very, very dangerous. And if a hero is telling you that...
0-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,At very least, I don't have to worry about you as a villain... You seem to only hit yourself...
0-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:huey=confident,Don’t worry, Florina! I’m sure Huey was safely out of range!
0-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2,saidMarker:localization=bored,Well! At least I didn’t have my outfit changed for the English Localization, Aimee!
0-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=confused,A-Aimee, I'd use my Lucky Charm to reverse time if you made a mistake, but there's no akumas here for me to use it on...
0-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=alarmed,A-Aimee, I might die of embarrassment, but if you do that wrong, you'll actually die!
0-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=alarmed,Aimee! You sure aren’t making sounds like that was a sure shot! Be careful!
0-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=embarrassed,Erm. If you do though, could you please <i>not</i> bring it here?
0-female_removed_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:2=confident,Hmm... Maybe now's not a great time, but could you do... Fashion Victim by Green Day?
0-female_removed_minor,target:blackrose,targetStage:3=confident,Wow! Those are cool tattoos, Blackrose!
0-female_removed_minor,target:blackrose,targetStage:3=embarrassed,U-um, those are tattoos, right? Those wavy things, and not scars? R-right?

0-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:1=embarrassed,O-oh. Well, this is embarrassing. I’m not really used to… Um… A scenario where something like you wasn’t just possessed.
0-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:alpha=embarrassed,Well, I guess Alpha is an AI that’s not possessed… I think. I’m keeping an eye on you, Chica.
0-female_removed_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:4=wink,It certainly seems to help fight off <i>your</i> Akuma. I figured it'd help me with mine!
0-female_removed_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:4=wink,I mean, you <i>did</i> just take off your boots.
0-female_removed_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:4=wink,I'd be happy to show you some tricks of my own, if you'd like!
0-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=wink,I really think well-made armor can keep you really mobile, right? Maybe just not as mobile as me.
0-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=confident,I'm really not one for armor, but my suit does really increase my pain tolerance and agility.
0-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=wink,I'd say you're finally coming out of your shell, Corrin, but you definitely seem fine with this.
0-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:3=wink,(She looks kind of like a frillier, female Adrien... Hmm...)
0-female_removed_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:3=alarmed,W-whoa! You really didn't need to bring so many guns, Elaine!
0-female_removed_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:3=alarmed,I-I'm glad you're retting gid--getting rid of those guns, Elaine!
0-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:2,totalMales:1-5=wink,I think most people know a breastplate is also a chestplate. Don’t get so worried, Florina!

0-female_removed_minor,target:florina,totalExposed:1-5=confident,I understand how you feel, Florina, but nothing’s wrong. You’re doing great!
0-female_removed_minor,target:gogo,targetStage:3=confused,That sounds really embarrassing... Is that why you're so... O-oh. N-nevermind.
0-female_removed_minor,target:gogo,targetStage:3=embarrassed,W-wait a second, t-that's-- That's so vulgar, GoGo!
0-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3=excited,Well! I applaud you being so clever! I’m definitely not sure what it would be like to take mine off piecemeal like that.
0-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba=confused,Futaba, I mean… I'm still interested in men but Gwen’s… Impressive in her own right...
0-female_removed_minor,target:kim,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:shego=calm,It's not like I haven't had a similar bond with some of the villains I've fought...
0-female_removed_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:3=excited,You look so cute, Kimberly! I-I get a little embarrassed when I bare my midriff, but you make it look great! E-er, you know what I mean.
0-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=confused,I’m so sorry. I wish my Lucky Charm could heal those. You’re still an amazing detective, I can tell even from this game…
0-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=bored,Quite forward to show up in your panties. To say the least.
0-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:socks=confused,W-wait a minute! You shouldn't threaten self-harm like that!
0-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4=confused,I… Wow. You must know all kinds of tricks, Kyu. (Would you mind teaching me some?)
0-female_removed_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:1=embarrassed,N-no?
0-female_removed_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:3=embarrassed,J-just because I don’t get a lot of chances to look at body art. But even without the art you’re really… You know…
0-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=confused,Um...I don’t know about that. Maybe you’re a warmer person than me?
0-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2=wink,I-I mean. I don't know what's going on. I wouldn't come to a game like this for <i>Adrien</i> or anything. Um. I guess a girl has to have her secrets, huh, Natsuki?
0-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=wink,You're really lucky Natsuki's so brave! This is usually a third or fourth date activity, and she's willing to do all this for <i>you</i>! It's romantic! In a way.
0-female_removed_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=confused,Er... if you want to stop, Nayru, I think most people here would be okay with it... no need to push yourself!
0-female_removed_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=excited,You seem like a weight's off your chest! What happened, Nayru?
0-female_removed_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:3=confident,They’re very classy, Nugi-chan. I recognize high quality clothing anywhere, and I’ll make sure they’re treated well!
0-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:2=embarrassed,I-I do mean sandals. M-meaning sandals are fine for the beach and your clothes, I just don’t like them. I-I’m not looking at your… Butt.
0-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:2=excited,I’ve never really seen a statuesque person undress before, so this is a bit novel to me.
0-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:5=embarrassed,Palutena, I do have to wonder what a goddess looks like under her um...last lines of defense.
0-female_removed_minor,target:pearl,targetStage:2=calm,And you certainly seem enchanting! I guess if you're not Akumatized, you're alright by me!
0-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika=confident,And with Nadeshiko helping you out, you already have a super strong team!
0-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3=wink,Okay, okay, okay. Saki, how about a hug? If you're cold or embarrassed, nothing fixes both like a big hug. And believe me, I need lots of hugs!
0-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba,saidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba=wink,Then we can talk about boys and stuff too. I actually already like Futaba's style, and I'm already kind of good at some games, so it's a great blend for Saki!
0-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=wink,Um, yeah! Well, crepes and mudmasks and all that are popular wherever you go, right? This'll be great!
0-female_removed_minor,target:sanako,targetStage:1=embarrassed,This is somewhat odd to admit, but this isn't my first visit here... you seem very familiar, Sanako, but I don't think I can place how...
0-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=calm,Well, my earrings are <i>kind of</i> like that gem of yours... does your kwami have a name?
0-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:3=wink,I'm glad one of us doesn't <i>seem</i> too concerned with losing. Don't worry. If you don't get your "grief seed," I'll make sure I do get my <i>akuma</i>.
0-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1=wink,I'm just really happy you have it together, Sayori! I have some other people to watch out for so they don't get Akumatized, but I'm glad you're emotionally stable!
0-female_removed_minor,target:shego,targetStage:1=bored,One piece of clothing at a time! Er... Hopefully losing here will make you rethink things?
0-female_removed_minor,target:shego,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei=embarrassed,I could tie her up with my yo-yo but I think she’d like that far too much...
0-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=embarrassed,U-uhm. That looked hot! I mean, hot as not as your-- n-not as hot as-- um, when you had burnmarks-- er--!
0-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:uravity=embarrassed,I guess we're both kind of lost in this, huh, Ochako...?
0-female_removed_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:3=alarmed,Er… about that… Er! H-hold on, don't panic, I can explain!
0-female_removed_minor,target:zelda,targetStage:4=confident,Weird, given we’re the title characters, right?
0-female_removed_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:2,marker:feet=bored,I mean, you’re an attractive woman taking off her clothes… Wait, did you mean… Your feet?
0-female_removed_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:2,marker:feet=confused,Er… What, the feet? Is this a thing people…

1-male_removing_minor=calm,Hmm. Do you really need to undress?
1-male_removing_minor=wink,You know, ~name~, you can always be a bit more adventurous than your ~clothing~.

1-male_removed_minor=embarrassed,You see a lot of strange things being a superhero... Nothing as odd as in this game.
1-male_removed_minor=confident,It’s hard to be creative under pressure, huh, ~name~?
1-male_removed_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=wink,O-oh my. You’re very handsome under that helmet.
1-male_removed_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:3=confident,Well, <i>Cap,</i> I hope you’ll share those years of experience with someone still getting the hang of it!
1-male_removed_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:3=wink,I think you can be gentle without being weak or cowardly. Don't lose the first part, Corrin.
1-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3=wink,I suppose there's something to be said about self-servicing... er... fashion design-wise, anyway.
1-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:4=confused,What's a Trion body? Is that like... some sort of power manifestation?
1-male_removed_minor,target:pit,targetStage:3=alarmed,A-anyway, let's keep playing! D-don't pay me too much mind!
1-male_removed_minor,target:pit,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:palutena=bored,Hmm. (I can't figure these two out! I've known Tikki for a long time, but I'm guessing divine figures are just like this!)

1-female_removing_minor,target:kim,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:shego=embarrassed,I-I mean, relationship as in friendship or rivalship?
1-female_removing_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:2=wink,I guess if it's strip poker, more layers would help... but I thought for sure it'd just be a sweatshirt, to fit in with your aesthetic!
1-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=bored,Oh, Kyoko…
1-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2=confused,Speaking of relief, do you have another set of underwear to keep you in the game, Kyu? It’s…
1-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:socks=embarrassed,Kyu wait! I'll take off something just so you don't have to if you'll---
1-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=calm,I think long gloves add a touch of class.
1-female_removing_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:0=wink,Because you look really punk-y!
1-female_removing_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:2=alarmed,I-I’m excited to see more!
1-female_removing_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=wink,I’m glad you’re having fun!

1-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=excited,<i>Merveilleux! I</i> see what's going on here...
1-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2=excited,Jeez, ~player~, have you considered asking Natsuki on a date, or what?
1-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:1=bored,I never really understood the appeal of thongs.
1-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:1=wink,Sandals seem… Attire appropriate.
1-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4=wink,Of course, Palutena, I’m here to win too! (And at this point it looks like we’re having more fun than worry. Palutena does these asides too, so that’s okay for me, right?)
1-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4=wink,Not that you really need me to, but I won’t let you fall under the akuma’s power!
1-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:neo=confident,Palutena, I know Neo is pint-sized, but we should focus on making sure we can take her down… But if you don’t want me to go easy on you...
1-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:shego=confident,Er… I’m not going to go easy on you, Palutena, but I think Shego is a bigger problem if we don’t stop her now.
1-female_removing_minor,target:pearl,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Not in a bad way, just in a way that seems enchanted.
1-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika=wink,The bad guys better watch out!
1-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2=confused,Um. If you even want to take off your shoes... er... which you halready lave-- already have! Y-you risk showing your-- um. You know.
1-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2=bored,I-I guess you've already shown your underwear on accident-- um, is that the wrong thing to say?!
1-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba,saidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba=excited,"Pwn?" Er... well, I'm guessing if we got loaded up on sugar and got all dressed up, getting competitive does seem a <i>little</i> fun... What do you think, Saki?
1-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=confident,Hmm… I mean, I’ve done <i>saunas</i> but… Err, well, okay, let’s do this, but we have to do some skincare and go for crepes afterwards.
1-female_removing_minor,target:sanako,targetStage:0=calm,(Hmm... she seems oddly familiar...)
1-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=confused,A "soul gem?" Hmm... is that where you store your guardian spirit to transform?
1-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=calm,Hmm... Well, I guess there's other types of heroes out there... other types of girls with magic too, I suppose!
1-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:0=calm,I'm glad Sayori is so excitable! Even if she's a bit spacy.
1-female_removing_minor,target:shego,targetStage:0=confident,You may not use an akuma, but I'll stop you anyway!
1-female_removing_minor,target:shego,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei=confident,Sei, can you just arrest Shego? I’d like to see her tied up. I-I mean behind bars.
1-female_removing_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=alarmed,F-flooding? <i>D-de l'eau dans vos chaussette?</i> Um... I-is this a euphemism?
1-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=wink,This whole thing's a little awkward but let’s try to stay calm and collected, okay?
1-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=alarmed,Um. I can't say I've ever had to worry about it. Sometimes afterwards, but never during! I guess it's a side effect of my Miraculous?
1-female_removing_minor,target:weiss,targetStage:2=wink,Not that anyone here seems to care about your money but you.
1-female_removed_minor=wink,Alya'd probably love to compare notes. You really, really know how to own your apparel!
1-female_removed_minor=alarmed,I  really   hope you weren’t attached enough to it for it to be a theme for evil powers though…
1-female_removed_minor=alarmed,You see a lot of strange things being a superhero... Nothing as odd as in this game.
1-female_removed_minor=wink,It’s hard to be creative under pressure, huh, ~name~?
1-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:crash,notSaidMarker:pegasusquish=confident,W-what? You can fly on a pegasus! That’s incredible, Florina! A-and sorry, ~name~, about your ~clothing~. And spine.
1-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:sonya,alsoPlayingStage:6,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:commando=embarrassed,Whoa, Sonya. That's... Wow, body paint. I didn't think I was into this. I guess I am, though.
1-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:zoey,notSaidMarker:rodeo,marker:rodeo=confused,Zoey, what do you mean by rodeo?
1-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:zoey,notSaidMarker:shimmy,marker:shimmy=wink,Shimmy? Oh! That’s a fun word to say! Shimmy... Shimmy... Shimmy... Erk. Sorry, ~name~, I got distracted...
1-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:6,marker:ztentacles=confident,I’m sure, even faced with a tentacle monster, ~name~ would hold her ground, Zone! No wardrobe destruction. Or. Um. Destruction of orifices.
1-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=bored,Erm, Aimee... This seems very, very dangerous. And if a hero is telling you that...
1-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,At very least, I don't have to worry about you as a villain... You seem to only hit yourself...
1-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:huey=confident,Don’t worry, Florina! I’m sure Huey was safely out of range!
1-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2,saidMarker:localization=bored,Well! At least I didn’t have my outfit changed for the English Localization, Aimee!
1-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=confused,A-Aimee, I'd use my Lucky Charm to reverse time if you made a mistake, but there's no akumas here for me to use it on...
1-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=alarmed,A-Aimee, I might die of embarrassment, but if you do that wrong, you'll actually die!
1-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=alarmed,Aimee! You sure aren’t making sounds like that was a sure shot! Be careful!
1-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=embarrassed,Erm. If you do though, could you please <i>not</i> bring it here?
1-female_removed_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:2=confident,Hmm... Maybe now's not a great time, but could you do... Fashion Victim by Green Day?
1-female_removed_minor,target:blackrose,targetStage:3=confident,Wow! Those are cool tattoos, Blackrose!
1-female_removed_minor,target:blackrose,targetStage:3=embarrassed,U-um, those are tattoos, right? Those wavy things, and not scars? R-right?
1-female_removed_minor,target:blake,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:aimee=embarrassed,H-hey Aimee! I-I just work with someone that's just as cute--I mean looks like her!
1-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:1=embarrassed,O-oh. Well, this is embarrassing. I’m not really used to… Um… A scenario where something like you wasn’t just possessed.
1-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:alpha=embarrassed,Well, I guess Alpha is an AI that’s not possessed… I think. I’m keeping an eye on you, Chica.
1-female_removed_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:4=wink,It certainly seems to help fight off <i>your</i> Akuma. I figured it'd help me with mine!
1-female_removed_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:4=wink,I mean, you <i>did</i> just take off your boots.
1-female_removed_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:4=wink,I'd be happy to show you some tricks of my own, if you'd like!
1-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=wink,I really think well-made armor can keep you really mobile, right? Maybe just not as mobile as me.
1-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=confident,I'm really not one for armor, but my suit does really increase my pain tolerance and agility.
1-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=wink,I'd say you're finally coming out of your shell, Corrin, but you definitely seem fine with this.
1-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:3=wink,(She looks kind of like a frillier, female Adrien... Hmm...)
1-female_removed_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:3=alarmed,W-whoa! You really didn't need to bring so many guns, Elaine!
1-female_removed_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:3=alarmed,I-I'm glad you're retting gid--getting rid of those guns, Elaine!
1-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:2,totalMales:1-5=wink,I think most people know a breastplate is also a chestplate. Don’t get so worried, Florina!

1-female_removed_minor,target:florina,totalExposed:1-5=confident,I understand how you feel, Florina, but nothing’s wrong. You’re doing great!
1-female_removed_minor,target:gogo,targetStage:3=confused,That sounds really embarrassing... Is that why you're so... O-oh. N-nevermind.
1-female_removed_minor,target:gogo,targetStage:3=embarrassed,W-wait a second, t-that's-- That's so vulgar, GoGo!
1-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3=excited,Well! I applaud you being so clever! I’m definitely not sure what it would be like to take mine off piecemeal like that.
1-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba=confused,Futaba, I mean… I'm still interested in men but Gwen’s… Impressive in her own right...
1-female_removed_minor,target:kim,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:shego=calm,It's not like I haven't had a similar bond with some of the villains I've fought...
1-female_removed_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:3=excited,You look so cute, Kimberly! I-I get a little embarrassed when I bare my midriff, but you make it look great! E-er, you know what I mean.
1-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=confused,I’m so sorry. I wish my Lucky Charm could heal those. You’re still an amazing detective, I can tell even from this game…
1-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=bored,Quite forward to show up in your panties. To say the least.
1-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:socks=confused,W-wait a minute! You shouldn't threaten self-harm like that!
1-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4=confused,I… Wow. You must know all kinds of tricks, Kyu. (Would you mind teaching me some?)
1-female_removed_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:1=embarrassed,N-no?
1-female_removed_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:3=embarrassed,J-just because I don’t get a lot of chances to look at body art. But even without the art you’re really… You know…
1-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=confused,Um...I don’t know about that. Maybe you’re a warmer person than me?
1-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2=wink,I-I mean. I don't know what's going on. I wouldn't come to a game like this for <i>Adrien</i> or anything. Um. I guess a girl has to have her secrets, huh, Natsuki?
1-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=wink,You're really lucky Natsuki's so brave! This is usually a third or fourth date activity, and she's willing to do all this for <i>you</i>! It's romantic! In a way.
1-female_removed_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=confused,Er... if you want to stop, Nayru, I think most people here would be okay with it... no need to push yourself!
1-female_removed_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=excited,You seem like a weight's off your chest! What happened, Nayru?
1-female_removed_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:3=confident,They’re very classy, Nugi-chan. I recognize high quality clothing anywhere, and I’ll make sure they’re treated well!
1-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:2=embarrassed,I-I do mean sandals. M-meaning sandals are fine for the beach and your clothes, I just don’t like them. I-I’m not looking at your… Butt.
1-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:2=excited,I’ve never really seen a statuesque person undress before, so this is a bit novel to me.
1-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:5=embarrassed,Palutena, I do have to wonder what a goddess looks like under her um...last lines of defense.
1-female_removed_minor,target:pearl,targetStage:2=calm,And you certainly seem enchanting! I guess if you're not Akumatized, you're alright by me!
1-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika=confident,And with Nadeshiko helping you out, you already have a super strong team!
1-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3=wink,Okay, okay, okay. Saki, how about a hug? If you're cold or embarrassed, nothing fixes both like a big hug. And believe me, I need lots of hugs!
1-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba,saidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba=wink,Then we can talk about boys and stuff too. I actually already like Futaba's style, and I'm already kind of good at some games, so it's a great blend for Saki!
1-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=wink,Um, yeah! Well, crepes and mudmasks and all that are popular wherever you go, right? This'll be great!
1-female_removed_minor,target:sanako,targetStage:1=embarrassed,This is somewhat odd to admit, but this isn't my first visit here... you seem very familiar, Sanako, but I don't think I can place how...
1-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=calm,Well, my earrings are <i>kind of</i> like that gem of yours... does your kwami have a name?
1-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:3=wink,I'm glad one of us doesn't <i>seem</i> too concerned with losing. Don't worry. If you don't get your "grief seed," I'll make sure I do get my <i>akuma</i>.
1-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1=wink,I'm just really happy you have it together, Sayori! I have some other people to watch out for so they don't get Akumatized, but I'm glad you're emotionally stable!
1-female_removed_minor,target:shego,targetStage:1=bored,One piece of clothing at a time! Er... Hopefully losing here will make you rethink things?
1-female_removed_minor,target:shego,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei=embarrassed,I could tie her up with my yo-yo but I think she’d like that far too much...
1-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=embarrassed,U-uhm. That looked hot! I mean, hot as not as your-- n-not as hot as-- um, when you had burnmarks-- er--!
1-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:uravity=embarrassed,I guess we're both kind of lost in this, huh, Ochako...?
1-female_removed_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:3=alarmed,Er… about that… Er! H-hold on, don't panic, I can explain!
1-female_removed_minor,target:zelda,targetStage:4=confident,Weird, given we’re the title characters, right?
1-female_removed_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:2,marker:feet=bored,I mean, you’re an attractive woman taking off her clothes… Wait, did you mean… Your feet?
1-female_removed_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:2,marker:feet=confused,Er… What, the feet? Is this a thing people…

2-male_removed_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:3=wink,I think you can be gentle without being weak or cowardly. Don't lose the first part, Corrin.
2-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3=wink,I suppose there's something to be said about self-servicing... er... fashion design-wise, anyway.
2-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:4=confused,Huh? What's a Trion body? Is that kind of like my transformation and powers?
2-male_removed_minor,target:pit,targetStage:3=alarmed,A-anyway, let's keep playing! D-don't pay me too much mind!
2-male_removed_minor,target:pit,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:palutena=bored,Hmm. (I can't figure these two out! I've known Tikki for a long time, but I'm guessing divine figures are just like this!)

2-female_removing_minor,saidMarker:ayano_f_suspicious,count-yandere:1-3=confident,~name~ has really pretty eyes, and a good sense of herself.
2-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4,count-yandere:1-3=confident,We’re all friends and heroes here, Palutena. But hopefully you can stay in the game long enough to help me subdue <i>her</i>!
2-female_removing_minor,filter:black_hair,priority:0=confident,You know, sometimes I do wonder what it'd have been like to have a more typical hair color...
2-female_removing_minor,filter:black_hair,priority:0=wink,Oh! I love hair like yours, ~name~. Black never goes out of style!
2-female_removing_minor,filter:blonde,priority:0=confident,I wonder if blondes <i>do</i> have more fun.
2-female_removing_minor,filter:blonde,priority:0=wink,You picked a really cute ~clothing~ to go with the brightness of your hair, ~name~!
2-female_removing_minor,filter:blue_hair,priority:0=embarrassed,Huh. You know. Is there a term for people like us? With blue hair? Blunette sounds kinda...
2-female_removing_minor,filter:blue_hair,priority:0=excited,Wow! I'm always happy to see other people with blue hair! Really! E-er! Just maybe not in a game like this!
2-female_removing_minor,filter:brunette,priority:0=excited,I get a little jealous about brown hair like ~name~'s. It's just so timeless!
2-female_removing_minor,filter:brunette,priority:0=wink,A nice thing about being a brunette must be that you can pull off just about any outfit like your ~clothing~, right, ~name~?
2-female_removing_minor,filter:exotic_hair,priority:0=embarrassed,Wow! So, I mean, I could um. Just stutted. Stutter! About your ~clothing~! But your hair is <i>so</i> impressive, ~name~!

2-female_removing_minor,filter:ginger,priority:0=excited,By the way, ~name~, I wanted you to know I really like your hair! It reminds me of Alya! A-and in a game like this, that's certainly a comfort.
2-female_removing_minor,filter:ginger,priority:0=confident,Don't let anyone ever make fun of you for your hair, ~name~! Your soul has to burn as brightly as your locks! E-er. Sorry, that sounds really deep.

2-female_removing_minor,filter:pink_hair,priority:0=excited,Pink hair? Oh! Just like Alyx! I hope you're just as quick on your feet, ~name~!
2-female_removing_minor,filter:pink_hair,priority:0=excited,<i>Pink</i> hair is pretty unusual. Unlike the really common blue variety. You should feel special, ~name~!

2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=alarmed,Ahh!!! Could you stop shooting like that!
2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=confident,It is a pretty impressive skill, at least. But please don't hurt anyone!
2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:florina=embarrassed,Er, I meant--You know, morally. Not...Mortally. Erk.
2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=wink,Oh! Is this what people mean when they say they want to shoot all over me? Is this just how some people undress in those old Western movies? ?
2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=confident,O-Okay. I'll go ahead and hope you know how to use... Whatever skill you're using.
2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=alarmed,Don’t encourage her, Zone! You don’t have some big amorphous blob that can shield us with tentacles!
2-female_removing_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Though... I haven't really seen a Miraculous compartmentalize like this...
2-female_removing_minor,target:ann,targetStage:0=confident,I've seen so many of your shoots! You really, really know how to own your apparel!
2-female_removing_minor,target:april,targetStage:1=excited,But I don’t know if the turtle miraculous holder likes pizza that much... or sewers. He definitely knows a lot about Ancient China though!
2-female_removing_minor,target:ayano,notSaidMarker:ayano_stripping=confused,It’s just ~clothing~, Ayano. I think you’re overreacting. (I’m going to keep an eye out for any butterflies, just in case... This seems bad.)
2-female_removing_minor,target:ayano,saidMarker:ayano_stripping=alarmed,It looks like you spend just as much time playing cards as you do practicing empathy, Ayano.
2-female_removing_minor,target:blake,targetStage:2=embarrassed,So given how things are going, maybe I should kiss you for luck?
2-female_removing_minor,target:blake,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:yang=wink,O-or if you aren’t, that’s okay too? Everyone has secrets! Love or otherwise.
2-female_removing_minor,target:chica,targetStage:0=alarmed,W-wait, that’s the one with the possessed animatronics! I have to free Chica from the Akuma, now!
2-female_removing_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:3=alarmed,Um, but. I, er. Spinning bird kick. Can you teach it to me?
2-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=calm,Those actually look really well made! I'm not one for armor, but it's nice to see you care about more than durability.
2-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=excited,Wow, Corrin, those look really stylish and actually durable!
2-female_removing_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:2=alarmed,O-oh. I-is that so? Hm.
2-female_removing_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:4=confident,Oh! I'm not the only one with that kind of talent... Um, as you may have seen.
2-female_removing_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:2=alarmed,Y-your... Husband? D-does he know you're at a game like this!?
2-female_removing_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:2=alarmed,I-I would never come here if I had a partner at home!
2-female_removing_minor,target:gogo,targetStage:2=calm,But that’s a good thing. You’re just like Chloe, and you’re so mean I can’t imagine you’d have nice powers.
2-female_removing_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:2=bored,Oh.
2-female_removing_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba=embarrassed,Er. We're not-- I'm not-- I mean, she's really pretty but--! I mean I would be <i>interested</i>
2-female_removing_minor,target:juri,targetStage:1=confused,Oh! Your gloves! Here I was thinking you'd take off your hairties or something.
2-female_removing_minor,target:kim,targetStage:0,saidMarker:kim_similar=embarrassed,Just less dressed.
2-female_removing_minor,target:kim,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:shego=embarrassed,I-I mean, relationship as in friendship or rivalship?
2-female_removing_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:2=wink,I guess if it's strip poker, more layers would help... but I thought for sure it'd just be a sweatshirt, to fit in with your aesthetic!
2-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=bored,Oh, Kyoko…
2-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2=alarmed,Since they’re part of your body-- The wings, not the socks!
2-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:socks=embarrassed,Kyu wait! I'll take off something just so you don't have to if you'll---
2-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=alarmed,This is very interesting. But aren’t those kind of dirty? I-I mean not that being dirty is bad but--
2-female_removing_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:0=wink,Because you look really punk-y!
2-female_removing_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:2=alarmed,I-I’m excited to see more!
2-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=excited,Here I go! Begone! THOT!
2-female_removing_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=wink,I’m glad you’re having fun!
2-female_removing_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=excited,It’s great playing with you too, Nagisa!
2-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=excited,<i>Merveilleux! I</i> see what's going on here...
2-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2=excited,Jeez, ~player~, have you considered asking Natsuki on a date, or what?
2-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:1=bored,I never really understood the appeal of thongs.
2-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:1=wink,Sandals seem… Attire appropriate.
2-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4=wink,Of course, Palutena, I’m here to win too! (And at this point it looks like we’re having more fun than worry. Palutena does these asides too, so that’s okay for me, right?)
2-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4=wink,Not that you really need me to, but I won’t let you fall under the akuma’s power!
2-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:neo=confident,Palutena, I know Neo is pint-sized, but we should focus on making sure we can take her down… But if you don’t want me to go easy on you...
2-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:shego=confident,Er… I’m not going to go easy on you, Palutena, but I think Shego is a bigger problem if we don’t stop her now.
2-female_removing_minor,target:pearl,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Not in a bad way, just in a way that seems enchanted.
2-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika=wink,The bad guys better watch out!
2-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2=confused,Um. If you even want to take off your shoes... er... which you halready lave-- already have! Y-you risk showing your-- um. You know.
2-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2=bored,I-I guess you've already shown your underwear on accident-- um, is that the wrong thing to say?!
2-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba,saidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba=excited,"Pwn?" Er... well, I'm guessing if we got loaded up on sugar and got all dressed up, getting competitive does seem a <i>little</i> fun... What do you think, Saki?
2-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=confident,Hmm… I mean, I’ve done <i>saunas</i> but… Err, well, okay, let’s do this, but we have to do some skincare and go for crepes afterwards.
2-female_removing_minor,target:sanako,targetStage:0=calm,(Hmm... she seems oddly familiar...)
2-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=confused,A "soul gem?" Hmm... is that where you store your guardian spirit to transform?
2-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=calm,Hmm... Well, I guess there's other types of heroes out there... other types of girls with magic too, I suppose!
2-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:0=calm,I'm glad Sayori is so excitable! Even if she's a bit spacy.
2-female_removing_minor,target:shego,targetStage:0=confident,You may not use an akuma, but I'll stop you anyway!
2-female_removing_minor,target:shego,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei=confident,Sei, can you just arrest Shego? I’d like to see her tied up. I-I mean behind bars.
2-female_removing_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=alarmed,F-flooding? <i>D-de l'eau dans vos chaussette?</i> Um... I-is this a euphemism?
2-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=wink,This whole thing's a little awkward but let’s try to stay calm and collected, okay?
2-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=alarmed,Um. I can't say I've ever had to worry about it. Sometimes afterwards, but never during! I guess it's a side effect of my Miraculous?
2-female_removing_minor,target:weiss,targetStage:2=wink,Not that anyone here seems to care about your money but you.
2-female_removed_minor=embarrassed,You looked good with that! Or without it. As an expression of your taste. Like with your mind. Not your tongue.
2-female_removed_minor=excited,Now that you’ve parted with that, maybe we’ll find something better in line with your fashion sense?
2-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:crash,notSaidMarker:pegasusquish=confident,W-what? You can fly on a pegasus! That’s incredible, Florina! A-and sorry, ~name~, about your ~clothing~. And spine.
2-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:sonya,alsoPlayingStage:6,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:commando=embarrassed,Whoa, Sonya. That's... Wow, body paint. I didn't think I was into this. I guess I am, though.
2-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:zoey,notSaidMarker:rodeo,marker:rodeo=confused,Zoey, what do you mean by rodeo?
2-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:zoey,notSaidMarker:shimmy,marker:shimmy=wink,Shimmy? Oh! That’s a fun word to say! Shimmy... Shimmy... Shimmy... Erk. Sorry, ~name~, I got distracted...
2-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:6,marker:ztentacles=confident,I’m sure, even faced with a tentacle monster, ~name~ would hold her ground, Zone! No wardrobe destruction. Or. Um. Destruction of orifices.
2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=bored,Erm, Aimee... This seems very, very dangerous. And if a hero is telling you that...
2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,At very least, I don't have to worry about you as a villain... You seem to only hit yourself...
2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:huey=confident,Don’t worry, Florina! I’m sure Huey was safely out of range!
2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=confused,A-Aimee, I'd use my Lucky Charm to reverse time if you made a mistake, but there's no akumas here for me to use it on...
2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=alarmed,A-Aimee, I might die of embarrassment, but if you do that wrong, you'll actually die!
2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=alarmed,Aimee! You sure aren’t making sounds like that was a sure shot! Be careful!
2-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=embarrassed,Erm. If you do though, could you please <i>not</i> bring it here?
2-female_removed_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:2=confident,Hmm... Maybe now's not a great time, but could you do... Fashion Victim by Green Day?
2-female_removed_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:5=confident,Alpha, I know you're digital but... You're pretty and definitely express your personality well. That's all you.
2-female_removed_minor,target:blackrose,targetStage:3=confident,Wow! Those are cool tattoos, Blackrose!
2-female_removed_minor,target:blackrose,targetStage:3=embarrassed,U-um, those are tattoos, right? Those wavy things, and not scars? R-right?
2-female_removed_minor,target:blake,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:aimee=embarrassed,H-hey Aimee! I-I just work with someone that's just as cute--I mean looks like her!
2-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:1=embarrassed,O-oh. Well, this is embarrassing. I’m not really used to… Um… A scenario where something like you wasn’t just possessed.
2-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:alpha=embarrassed,Well, I guess Alpha is an AI that’s not possessed… I think. I’m keeping an eye on you, Chica.
2-female_removed_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:4=wink,It certainly seems to help fight off <i>your</i> Akuma. I figured it'd help me with mine!
2-female_removed_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:4=wink,I mean, you <i>did</i> just take off your boots.
2-female_removed_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:4=wink,I'd be happy to show you some tricks of my own, if you'd like!
2-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=wink,I really think well-made armor can keep you really mobile, right? Maybe just not as mobile as me.
2-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=confident,I'm really not one for armor, but my suit does really increase my pain tolerance and agility.
2-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=wink,I'd say you're finally coming out of your shell, Corrin, but you definitely seem fine with this.
2-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:3=wink,(She looks kind of like a frillier, female Adrien... Hmm...)
2-female_removed_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:3=alarmed,W-whoa! You really didn't need to bring so many guns, Elaine!
2-female_removed_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:3=alarmed,I-I'm glad you're retting gid--getting rid of those guns, Elaine!
2-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:2,totalMales:1-5=wink,I think most people know a breastplate is also a chestplate. Don’t get so worried, Florina!
2-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:lyn=calm,Aww! You two are so sweet on each other!
2-female_removed_minor,target:florina,totalExposed:1-5=confident,I understand how you feel, Florina, but nothing’s wrong. You’re doing great!
2-female_removed_minor,target:gogo,targetStage:3=confused,That sounds really embarrassing... Is that why you're so... O-oh. N-nevermind.
2-female_removed_minor,target:gogo,targetStage:3=embarrassed,W-wait a second, t-that's-- That's so vulgar, GoGo!
2-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3=excited,Well! I applaud you being so clever! I’m definitely not sure what it would be like to take mine off piecemeal like that.
2-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba=confused,Futaba, I mean… I'm still interested in men but Gwen’s… Impressive in her own right...
2-female_removed_minor,target:kim,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:shego=calm,It's not like I haven't had a similar bond with some of the villains I've fought...
2-female_removed_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:3=excited,You look so cute, Kimberly! I-I get a little embarrassed when I bare my midriff, but you make it look great! E-er, you know what I mean.
2-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=confused,I’m so sorry. I wish my Lucky Charm could heal those. You’re still an amazing detective, I can tell even from this game…
2-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Um. Are your wings sensitive, Kyu?
2-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:socks=confused,W-wait a minute! You shouldn't threaten self-harm like that!
2-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4=excited,Um, what about your mouth? It’s very cute but <i>I’d</i> rather the only dirty parts be your language.
2-female_removed_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:1=embarrassed,N-no?
2-female_removed_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:3=embarrassed,J-just because I don’t get a lot of chances to look at body art. But even without the art you’re really… You know…
2-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=embarrassed,O-oh. I guess it didn’t work… Maybe she meant Thoth, like that Egyptian god the Pharaoh channeled?
2-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=confused,Um...I don’t know about that. Maybe you’re a warmer person than me?
2-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2=wink,I-I mean. I don't know what's going on. I wouldn't come to a game like this for <i>Adrien</i> or anything. Um. I guess a girl has to have her secrets, huh, Natsuki?
2-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=wink,You're really lucky Natsuki's so brave! This is usually a third or fourth date activity, and she's willing to do all this for <i>you</i>! It's romantic! In a way.
2-female_removed_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=confused,Er... if you want to stop, Nayru, I think most people here would be okay with it... no need to push yourself!
2-female_removed_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=excited,You seem like a weight's off your chest! What happened, Nayru?
2-female_removed_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:3=confident,They’re very classy, Nugi-chan. I recognize high quality clothing anywhere, and I’ll make sure they’re treated well!
2-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:2=embarrassed,I-I do mean sandals. M-meaning sandals are fine for the beach and your clothes, I just don’t like them. I-I’m not looking at your… Butt.
2-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:2=excited,I’ve never really seen a statuesque person undress before, so this is a bit novel to me.
2-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:5=embarrassed,Palutena, I do have to wonder what a goddess looks like under her um...last lines of defense.
2-female_removed_minor,target:pearl,targetStage:2=calm,And you certainly seem enchanting! I guess if you're not Akumatized, you're alright by me!
2-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika=confident,And with Nadeshiko helping you out, you already have a super strong team!
2-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3=wink,Okay, okay, okay. Saki, how about a hug? If you're cold or embarrassed, nothing fixes both like a big hug. And believe me, I need lots of hugs!
2-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba,saidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba=wink,Then we can talk about boys and stuff too. I actually already like Futaba's style, and I'm already kind of good at some games, so it's a great blend for Saki!
2-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=wink,Um, yeah! Well, crepes and mudmasks and all that are popular wherever you go, right? This'll be great!
2-female_removed_minor,target:sanako,targetStage:1=embarrassed,This is somewhat odd to admit, but this isn't my first visit here... you seem very familiar, Sanako, but I don't think I can place how...
2-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=calm,Well, my earrings are <i>kind of</i> like that gem of yours... does your kwami have a name?
2-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:3=wink,I'm glad one of us doesn't <i>seem</i> too concerned with losing. Don't worry. If you don't get your "grief seed," I'll make sure I do get my <i>akuma</i>.
2-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1=wink,I'm just really happy you have it together, Sayori! I have some other people to watch out for so they don't get Akumatized, but I'm glad you're emotionally stable!
2-female_removed_minor,target:shego,targetStage:1=bored,One piece of clothing at a time! Er... Hopefully losing here will make you rethink things?
2-female_removed_minor,target:shego,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei=embarrassed,I could tie her up with my yo-yo but I think she’d like that far too much...
2-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=embarrassed,U-uhm. That looked hot! I mean, hot as not as your-- n-not as hot as-- um, when you had burnmarks-- er--!

3-male_removed_minor,target:pit,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:palutena=bored,Hmm. (I can't figure these two out! I've known Tikki for a long time, but I'm guessing divine figures are just like this!)

3-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=alarmed,Aimee! You sure aren’t making sounds like that was a sure shot! Be careful!
3-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=embarrassed,Erm. If you do though, could you please <i>not</i> bring it here?
3-female_removed_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:2=confident,Hmm... Maybe now's not a great time, but could you do... Fashion Victim by Green Day?
3-female_removed_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:5=confident,Alpha, I know you're digital but... You're pretty and definitely express your personality well. That's all you.
3-female_removed_minor,target:blackrose,targetStage:3=confident,Wow! Those are cool tattoos, Blackrose!
3-female_removed_minor,target:blackrose,targetStage:3=embarrassed,U-um, those are tattoos, right? Those wavy things, and not scars? R-right?
3-female_removed_minor,target:blake,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:aimee=embarrassed,H-hey Aimee! I-I just work with someone that's just as cute--I mean looks like her!
3-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:1=embarrassed,O-oh. Well, this is embarrassing. I’m not really used to… Um… A scenario where something like you wasn’t just possessed.
3-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:alpha=embarrassed,Well, I guess Alpha is an AI that’s not possessed… I think. I’m keeping an eye on you, Chica.
3-female_removed_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:4=wink,It certainly seems to help fight off <i>your</i> Akuma. I figured it'd help me with mine!
3-female_removed_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:4=wink,I mean, you <i>did</i> just take off your boots.
3-female_removed_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:4=wink,I'd be happy to show you some tricks of my own, if you'd like!
3-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=wink,I really think well-made armor can keep you really mobile, right? Maybe just not as mobile as me.
3-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=confident,I'm really not one for armor, but my suit does really increase my pain tolerance and agility.
3-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=wink,I'd say you're finally coming out of your shell, Corrin, but you definitely seem fine with this.
3-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:3=wink,(She looks kind of like a frillier, female Adrien... Hmm...)

3-female_removed_minor,target:florina,totalExposed:1-5=confident,I understand how you feel, Florina, but nothing’s wrong. You’re doing great!
3-female_removed_minor,target:gogo,targetStage:3=confused,That sounds really embarrassing... Is that why you're so... O-oh. N-nevermind.
3-female_removed_minor,target:gogo,targetStage:3=embarrassed,W-wait a second, t-that's-- That's so vulgar, GoGo!
3-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3=excited,Well! I applaud you being so clever! I’m definitely not sure what it would be like to take mine off piecemeal like that.

3-female_removed_minor,target:kim,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:shego=calm,It's not like I haven't had a similar bond with some of the villains I've fought...
3-female_removed_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:3=excited,You look so cute, Kimberly! I-I get a little embarrassed when I bare my midriff, but you make it look great! E-er, you know what I mean.
3-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=confused,I’m so sorry. I wish my Lucky Charm could heal those. You’re still an amazing detective, I can tell even from this game…
3-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Um. Are your wings sensitive, Kyu?
3-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:socks=confused,W-wait a minute! You shouldn't threaten self-harm like that!
3-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4=excited,Um, what about your mouth? It’s very cute but <i>I’d</i> rather the only dirty parts be your language.
3-female_removed_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:1=embarrassed,N-no?
3-female_removed_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:3=embarrassed,J-just because I don’t get a lot of chances to look at body art. But even without the art you’re really… You know…
3-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=embarrassed,O-oh. I guess it didn’t work… Maybe she meant Thoth, like that Egyptian god the Pharaoh channeled?
3-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=confused,Um...I don’t know about that. Maybe you’re a warmer person than me?
3-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2=wink,I-I mean. I don't know what's going on. I wouldn't come to a game like this for <i>Adrien</i> or anything. Um. I guess a girl has to have her secrets, huh, Natsuki?
3-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=wink,You're really lucky Natsuki's so brave! This is usually a third or fourth date activity, and she's willing to do all this for <i>you</i>! It's romantic! In a way.
3-female_removed_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=confused,Er... if you want to stop, Nayru, I think most people here would be okay with it... no need to push yourself!
3-female_removed_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=excited,You seem like a weight's off your chest! What happened, Nayru?
3-female_removed_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:3=confident,They’re very classy, Nugi-chan. I recognize high quality clothing anywhere, and I’ll make sure they’re treated well!
3-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:2=embarrassed,I-I do mean sandals. M-meaning sandals are fine for the beach and your clothes, I just don’t like them. I-I’m not looking at your… Butt.
3-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:2=excited,I’ve never really seen a statuesque person undress before, so this is a bit novel to me.
3-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:5=embarrassed,Palutena, I do have to wonder what a goddess looks like under her um...last lines of defense.
3-female_removed_minor,target:pearl,targetStage:2=calm,And you certainly seem enchanting! I guess if you're not Akumatized, you're alright by me!
3-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika=confident,And with Nadeshiko helping you out, you already have a super strong team!
3-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3=wink,Okay, okay, okay. Saki, how about a hug? If you're cold or embarrassed, nothing fixes both like a big hug. And believe me, I need lots of hugs!
3-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba,saidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba=wink,Then we can talk about boys and stuff too. I actually already like Futaba's style, and I'm already kind of good at some games, so it's a great blend for Saki!
3-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=wink,Um, yeah! Well, crepes and mudmasks and all that are popular wherever you go, right? This'll be great!
3-female_removed_minor,target:sanako,targetStage:1=embarrassed,This is somewhat odd to admit, but this isn't my first visit here... you seem very familiar, Sanako, but I don't think I can place how...
3-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=calm,Well, my earrings are <i>kind of</i> like that gem of yours... does your kwami have a name?
3-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:3=wink,I'm glad one of us doesn't <i>seem</i> too concerned with losing. Don't worry. If you don't get your "grief seed," I'll make sure I do get my <i>akuma</i>.
3-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1=wink,I'm just really happy you have it together, Sayori! I have some other people to watch out for so they don't get Akumatized, but I'm glad you're emotionally stable!
3-female_removed_minor,target:shego,targetStage:1=bored,One piece of clothing at a time! Er... Hopefully losing here will make you rethink things?
3-female_removed_minor,target:shego,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei=embarrassed,I could tie her up with my yo-yo but I think she’d like that far too much...
3-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=embarrassed,U-uhm. That looked hot! I mean, hot as not as your-- n-not as hot as-- um, when you had burnmarks-- er--!
3-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:uravity=embarrassed,I guess we're both kind of lost in this, huh, Ochako...?
3-female_removed_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:3=alarmed,Er… about that… Er! H-hold on, don't panic, I can explain!
3-female_removed_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:2,marker:feet=bored,I mean, you’re an attractive woman taking off her clothes… Wait, did you mean… Your feet?
3-female_removed_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:2,marker:feet=confused,Er… What, the feet? Is this a thing people…

4-female_removing_minor,target:chica,targetStage:0=alarmed,W-wait, that’s the one with the possessed animatronics! I have to free Chica from the Akuma, now!
4-female_removing_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:3=alarmed,Um, but. I, er. Spinning bird kick. Can you teach it to me?
4-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=calm,Those actually look really well made! I'm not one for armor, but it's nice to see you care about more than durability.
4-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=excited,Wow, Corrin, those look really stylish and actually durable!
4-female_removing_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:2=alarmed,O-oh. I-is that so? Hm.
4-female_removing_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:4=confident,Oh! I'm not the only one with that kind of talent... Um, as you may have seen.
4-female_removing_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:2=alarmed,Y-your... Husband? D-does he know you're at a game like this!?
4-female_removing_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:2=alarmed,I-I would never come here if I had a partner at home!
4-female_removing_minor,target:gogo,targetStage:2=calm,But that’s a good thing. You’re just like Chloe, and you’re so mean I can’t imagine you’d have nice powers.
4-female_removing_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:2=bored,Oh.
4-female_removing_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba=embarrassed,Er. We're not-- I'm not-- I mean, she's really pretty but--! I mean I would be <i>interested</i>
4-female_removing_minor,target:juri,targetStage:1=confused,Oh! Your gloves! Here I was thinking you'd take off your hairties or something.
4-female_removing_minor,target:kim,targetStage:0,saidMarker:kim_similar=embarrassed,Just less dressed.
4-female_removing_minor,target:kim,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:shego=embarrassed,I-I mean, relationship as in friendship or rivalship?
4-female_removing_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:2=wink,I guess if it's strip poker, more layers would help... but I thought for sure it'd just be a sweatshirt, to fit in with your aesthetic!
4-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=bored,Oh, Kyoko…
4-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2=alarmed,Since they’re part of your body-- The wings, not the socks!
4-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:socks=embarrassed,Kyu wait! I'll take off something just so you don't have to if you'll---
4-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=alarmed,This is very interesting. But aren’t those kind of dirty? I-I mean not that being dirty is bad but--
4-female_removing_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:0=wink,Because you look really punk-y!
4-female_removing_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:2=alarmed,I-I’m excited to see more!
4-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=excited,Here I go! Begone! THOT!
4-female_removing_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=wink,I’m glad you’re having fun!
4-female_removing_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=excited,It’s great playing with you too, Nagisa!
4-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=excited,<i>Merveilleux! I</i> see what's going on here...
4-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2=excited,Jeez, ~player~, have you considered asking Natsuki on a date, or what?
4-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:1=bored,I never really understood the appeal of thongs.
4-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:1=wink,Sandals seem… Attire appropriate.
4-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4=wink,Of course, Palutena, I’m here to win too! (And at this point it looks like we’re having more fun than worry. Palutena does these asides too, so that’s okay for me, right?)
4-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4=wink,Not that you really need me to, but I won’t let you fall under the akuma’s power!
4-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:neo=confident,Palutena, I know Neo is pint-sized, but we should focus on making sure we can take her down… But if you don’t want me to go easy on you...
4-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:shego=confident,Er… I’m not going to go easy on you, Palutena, but I think Shego is a bigger problem if we don’t stop her now.
4-female_removing_minor,target:pearl,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Not in a bad way, just in a way that seems enchanted.
4-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika=wink,The bad guys better watch out!
4-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2=confused,Um. If you even want to take off your shoes... er... which you halready lave-- already have! Y-you risk showing your-- um. You know.
4-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2=bored,I-I guess you've already shown your underwear on accident-- um, is that the wrong thing to say?!
4-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba,saidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba=excited,"Pwn?" Er... well, I'm guessing if we got loaded up on sugar and got all dressed up, getting competitive does seem a <i>little</i> fun... What do you think, Saki?
4-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=confident,Hmm… I mean, I’ve done <i>saunas</i> but… Err, well, okay, let’s do this, but we have to do some skincare and go for crepes afterwards.
4-female_removing_minor,target:sanako,targetStage:0=calm,(Hmm... she seems oddly familiar...)
4-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=confused,A "soul gem?" Hmm... is that where you store your guardian spirit to transform?
4-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=calm,Hmm... Well, I guess there's other types of heroes out there... other types of girls with magic too, I suppose!
4-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:0=calm,I'm glad Sayori is so excitable! Even if she's a bit spacy.
4-female_removing_minor,target:shego,targetStage:0=confident,You may not use an akuma, but I'll stop you anyway!
4-female_removing_minor,target:shego,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei=confident,Sei, can you just arrest Shego? I’d like to see her tied up. I-I mean behind bars.
4-female_removing_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=alarmed,F-flooding? <i>D-de l'eau dans vos chaussette?</i> Um... I-is this a euphemism?
4-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=wink,This whole thing's a little awkward but let’s try to stay calm and collected, okay?
4-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=alarmed,Um. I can't say I've ever had to worry about it. Sometimes afterwards, but never during! I guess it's a side effect of my Miraculous?
4-female_removing_minor,target:weiss,targetStage:2=wink,Not that anyone here seems to care about your money but you.
4-female_removed_minor=alarmed,I could use the extra coverage, about now.
4-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:crash,notSaidMarker:pegasusquish=confident,W-what? You can fly on a pegasus! That’s incredible, Florina! A-and sorry, ~name~, about your ~clothing~. And spine.
4-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:sonya,alsoPlayingStage:6,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:commando=embarrassed,Whoa, Sonya. That's... Wow, body paint. I didn't think I was into this. I guess I am, though.
4-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:zoey,notSaidMarker:rodeo,marker:rodeo=confused,Zoey, what do you mean by rodeo?
4-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:zoey,notSaidMarker:shimmy,marker:shimmy=wink,Shimmy? Oh! That’s a fun word to say! Shimmy... Shimmy... Shimmy... Erk. Sorry, ~name~, I got distracted...
4-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:6,marker:ztentacles=confident,I’m sure, even faced with a tentacle monster, ~name~ would hold her ground, Zone! No wardrobe destruction. Or. Um. Destruction of orifices.
4-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=bored,Erm, Aimee... This seems very, very dangerous. And if a hero is telling you that...
4-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,At very least, I don't have to worry about you as a villain... You seem to only hit yourself...
4-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:huey=confident,Don’t worry, Florina! I’m sure Huey was safely out of range!
4-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=confused,A-Aimee, I'd use my Lucky Charm to reverse time if you made a mistake, but there's no akumas here for me to use it on...
4-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=alarmed,A-Aimee, I might die of embarrassment, but if you do that wrong, you'll actually die!
4-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=alarmed,Aimee! You sure aren’t making sounds like that was a sure shot! Be careful!
4-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=embarrassed,Erm. If you do though, could you please <i>not</i> bring it here?
4-female_removed_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:2=confident,Hmm... Maybe now's not a great time, but could you do... Fashion Victim by Green Day?
4-female_removed_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:5=confident,Alpha, I know you're digital but... You're pretty and definitely express your personality well. That's all you.
4-female_removed_minor,target:blackrose,targetStage:3=confident,Wow! Those are cool tattoos, Blackrose!
4-female_removed_minor,target:blackrose,targetStage:3=embarrassed,U-um, those are tattoos, right? Those wavy things, and not scars? R-right?
4-female_removed_minor,target:blake,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:aimee=embarrassed,H-hey Aimee! I-I just work with someone that's just as cute--I mean looks like her!
4-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:1=embarrassed,O-oh. Well, this is embarrassing. I’m not really used to… Um… A scenario where something like you wasn’t just possessed.
4-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:alpha=embarrassed,Well, I guess Alpha is an AI that’s not possessed… I think. I’m keeping an eye on you, Chica.
4-female_removed_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:4=wink,It certainly seems to help fight off <i>your</i> Akuma. I figured it'd help me with mine!
4-female_removed_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:4=wink,I mean, you <i>did</i> just take off your boots.
4-female_removed_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:4=wink,I'd be happy to show you some tricks of my own, if you'd like!
4-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=wink,I really think well-made armor can keep you really mobile, right? Maybe just not as mobile as me.
4-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=confident,I'm really not one for armor, but my suit does really increase my pain tolerance and agility.
4-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=wink,I'd say you're finally coming out of your shell, Corrin, but you definitely seem fine with this.
4-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:3=wink,(She looks kind of like a frillier, female Adrien... Hmm...)
4-female_removed_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:3=alarmed,W-whoa! You really didn't need to bring so many guns, Elaine!
4-female_removed_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:3=alarmed,I-I'm glad you're retting gid--getting rid of those guns, Elaine!
4-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:2,totalMales:1-5=wink,I think most people know a breastplate is also a chestplate. Don’t get so worried, Florina!
4-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:lyn=calm,Aww! You two are so sweet on each other!
4-female_removed_minor,target:florina,totalExposed:1-5=confident,I understand how you feel, Florina, but nothing’s wrong. You’re doing great!
4-female_removed_minor,target:gogo,targetStage:3=confused,That sounds really embarrassing... Is that why you're so... O-oh. N-nevermind.
4-female_removed_minor,target:gogo,targetStage:3=embarrassed,W-wait a second, t-that's-- That's so vulgar, GoGo!
4-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3=excited,Well! I applaud you being so clever! I’m definitely not sure what it would be like to take mine off piecemeal like that.
4-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba=confused,Futaba, I mean… I'm still interested in men but Gwen’s… Impressive in her own right...
4-female_removed_minor,target:kim,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:shego=calm,It's not like I haven't had a similar bond with some of the villains I've fought...
4-female_removed_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:3=excited,You look so cute, Kimberly! I-I get a little embarrassed when I bare my midriff, but you make it look great! E-er, you know what I mean.
4-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=confused,I’m so sorry. I wish my Lucky Charm could heal those. You’re still an amazing detective, I can tell even from this game…
4-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Um. Are your wings sensitive, Kyu?
4-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:socks=confused,W-wait a minute! You shouldn't threaten self-harm like that!
4-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4=excited,Um, what about your mouth? It’s very cute but <i>I’d</i> rather the only dirty parts be your language.
4-female_removed_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:1=embarrassed,N-no?
4-female_removed_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:3=embarrassed,J-just because I don’t get a lot of chances to look at body art. But even without the art you’re really… You know…
4-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=embarrassed,O-oh. I guess it didn’t work… Maybe she meant Thoth, like that Egyptian god the Pharaoh channeled?
4-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=confused,Um...I don’t know about that. Maybe you’re a warmer person than me?
4-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2=wink,I-I mean. I don't know what's going on. I wouldn't come to a game like this for <i>Adrien</i> or anything. Um. I guess a girl has to have her secrets, huh, Natsuki?
4-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=wink,You're really lucky Natsuki's so brave! This is usually a third or fourth date activity, and she's willing to do all this for <i>you</i>! It's romantic! In a way.
4-female_removed_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=confused,Er... if you want to stop, Nayru, I think most people here would be okay with it... no need to push yourself!
4-female_removed_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=excited,You seem like a weight's off your chest! What happened, Nayru?
4-female_removed_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:3=confident,They’re very classy, Nugi-chan. I recognize high quality clothing anywhere, and I’ll make sure they’re treated well!
4-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:2=embarrassed,I-I do mean sandals. M-meaning sandals are fine for the beach and your clothes, I just don’t like them. I-I’m not looking at your… Butt.
4-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:2=excited,I’ve never really seen a statuesque person undress before, so this is a bit novel to me.
4-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:5=embarrassed,Palutena, I do have to wonder what a goddess looks like under her um...last lines of defense.
4-female_removed_minor,target:pearl,targetStage:2=calm,And you certainly seem enchanting! I guess if you're not Akumatized, you're alright by me!
4-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika=confident,And with Nadeshiko helping you out, you already have a super strong team!
4-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3=wink,Okay, okay, okay. Saki, how about a hug? If you're cold or embarrassed, nothing fixes both like a big hug. And believe me, I need lots of hugs!
4-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba,saidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba=wink,Then we can talk about boys and stuff too. I actually already like Futaba's style, and I'm already kind of good at some games, so it's a great blend for Saki!
4-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=wink,Um, yeah! Well, crepes and mudmasks and all that are popular wherever you go, right? This'll be great!
4-female_removed_minor,target:sanako,targetStage:1=embarrassed,This is somewhat odd to admit, but this isn't my first visit here... you seem very familiar, Sanako, but I don't think I can place how...
4-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=calm,Well, my earrings are <i>kind of</i> like that gem of yours... does your kwami have a name?
4-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:3=wink,I'm glad one of us doesn't <i>seem</i> too concerned with losing. Don't worry. If you don't get your "grief seed," I'll make sure I do get my <i>akuma</i>.
4-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1=wink,I'm just really happy you have it together, Sayori! I have some other people to watch out for so they don't get Akumatized, but I'm glad you're emotionally stable!
4-female_removed_minor,target:shego,targetStage:1=bored,One piece of clothing at a time! Er... Hopefully losing here will make you rethink things?
4-female_removed_minor,target:shego,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei=embarrassed,I could tie her up with my yo-yo but I think she’d like that far too much...
4-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=embarrassed,U-uhm. That looked hot! I mean, hot as not as your-- n-not as hot as-- um, when you had burnmarks-- er--!
4-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:uravity=embarrassed,I guess we're both kind of lost in this, huh, Ochako...?
4-female_removed_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:3=alarmed,Er… about that… Er! H-hold on, don't panic, I can explain!
4-female_removed_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:2,marker:feet=bored,I mean, you’re an attractive woman taking off her clothes… Wait, did you mean… Your feet?
4-female_removed_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:2,marker:feet=confused,Er… What, the feet? Is this a thing people…

5-male_removing_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=embarrassed,E-er. Hm. I think I prefer men that are a bit more... masculine.
5-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Tamokoma Branch? Is that like... your hero organization? The trivia's fine, Jin. Kind of like the rest of you... Er--

5-male_removing_minor,target:pit,targetStage:2=embarrassed,The rest of you looks much better. Um. Especially the... Not clothes parts.
5-male_removing_minor,target:pit,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=embarrassed,Yeah, sandals are a bit... Um. (How do I say they're not attractive without being really mean?)
5-male_removed_minor=alarmed,You must be working for Hawk Moth.
5-male_removed_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=embarrassed,O-oh my. You’re very striking under that helmet, Captain America. (<i>Ca valait la peine.</i>)
5-male_removed_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:3=confident,Hmm. I-I was kind of expecting a different answer! (Tellement pour espérer qu'il allait me dire.)
5-male_removed_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:3=wink,I think you can be gentle without being weak or cowardly. Don't lose the first part, Corrin.
5-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3=wink,I suppose there's something to be said about self-servicing... er... fashion design-wise, anyway.
5-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:4=confused,Huh? What's a Trion body? Is that kind of like my transformation and powers?
5-male_removed_minor,target:pit,targetStage:3=alarmed,A-anyway, let's keep playing! D-don't pay me too much mind!
5-male_removed_minor,target:pit,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:palutena=bored,Hmm. (I can't figure these two out! I've known Tikki for a long time, but I'm guessing divine figures are just like this!)
5-female_removing_minor=excited,I wanted to be a trendsetter...Not like this, though.
5-female_removing_minor=bored,I-is that it?
5-female_removing_minor,alsoPlaying:zoey,alsoPlayingStage:2=alarmed,HBO? Wait, this isn’t on TV? W-wait, HBO has things like this on it?
5-female_removing_minor,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:2,marker:ztentacles=alarmed,Um. People can enjoy sex however they want, Zone-tan, but I think most people prefer not to have their wardrobes damaged in the process!

5-female_removing_minor,filter:yandere,saidMarker:ayano_f_suspicious,count-yandere:1-3=confident,I can't let you be a danger to others, ~name~! Er-- apparently, I can't just fight you... that's security's job...
5-female_removing_minor,filter:yandere,saidMarker:ayano_f_suspicious,count-yandere:1-3=embarrassed,You should be ashamed of how you've been treating other people, ~name~.
5-female_removing_minor,filter:yandere,saidMarker:ayano_f_suspicious,count-yandere:1-3=confident,This serves you right.
5-female_removing_minor,filter:yandere,saidMarker:ayano_f_suspicious,count-yandere:1-3=alarmed,T-there's no akuma here, is there, just ~name~ and her whole yandere stuff!
5-female_removing_minor,saidMarker:ayano_f_suspicious,count-yandere:1-3=confident,~name~ has really pretty eyes, and a good sense of herself.
5-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4,count-yandere:1-3=confident,We’re all friends and heroes here, Palutena. But hopefully you can stay in the game long enough to help me subdue <i>her</i>!
5-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=alarmed,Ahh!!! Could you stop shooting like that!
5-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=confident,It is a pretty impressive skill, at least. But please don't hurt anyone!
5-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:florina=embarrassed,Er, I meant--You know, morally. Not...Mortally. Erk.
5-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=wink,Oh! Is this what people mean when they say they want to shoot all over me? Is this just how some people undress in those old Western movies? ?
5-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=confident,O-Okay. I'll go ahead and hope you know how to use... Whatever skill you're using.
5-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=alarmed,Don’t encourage her, Zone! You don’t have some big amorphous blob that can shield us with tentacles!
5-female_removing_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Though... I haven't really seen a Miraculous compartmentalize like this...
5-female_removing_minor,target:ann,targetStage:0=confident,I've seen so many of your shoots! You really, really know how to own your apparel!
5-female_removing_minor,target:april,targetStage:1=excited,But I don’t know if the turtle miraculous holder likes pizza that much... or sewers. He definitely knows a lot about Ancient China though!
5-female_removing_minor,target:ayano,notSaidMarker:ayano_stripping=confused,It’s just ~clothing~, Ayano. I think you’re overreacting. (I’m going to keep an eye out for any butterflies, just in case... This seems bad.)
5-female_removing_minor,target:ayano,saidMarker:ayano_stripping=alarmed,It looks like you spend just as much time playing cards as you do practicing empathy, Ayano.
5-female_removing_minor,target:blake,targetStage:2=embarrassed,So given how things are going, maybe I should kiss you for luck?
5-female_removing_minor,target:blake,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:yang=wink,O-or if you aren’t, that’s okay too? Everyone has secrets! Love or otherwise.
5-female_removing_minor,target:chica,targetStage:0=alarmed,W-wait, that’s the one with the possessed animatronics! I have to free Chica from the Akuma, now!
5-female_removing_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:3=alarmed,Um, but. I, er. Spinning bird kick. Can you teach it to me?
5-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=calm,Those actually look really well made! I'm not one for armor, but it's nice to see you care about more than durability.
5-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=excited,Wow, Corrin, those look really stylish and actually durable!
5-female_removing_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:2=alarmed,O-oh. I-is that so? Hm.
5-female_removing_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:4=confident,Oh! I'm not the only one with that kind of talent... Um, as you may have seen.
5-female_removing_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:2=alarmed,Y-your... Husband? D-does he know you're at a game like this!?
5-female_removing_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:2=alarmed,I-I would never come here if I had a partner at home!
5-female_removing_minor,target:gogo,targetStage:2=calm,But that’s a good thing. You’re just like Chloe, and you’re so mean I can’t imagine you’d have nice powers.
5-female_removing_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:2=bored,Oh.
5-female_removing_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba=embarrassed,Er. We're not-- I'm not-- I mean, she's really pretty but--! I mean I would be <i>interested</i>
5-female_removing_minor,target:juri,targetStage:1=confused,Oh! Your gloves! Here I was thinking you'd take off your hairties or something.
5-female_removing_minor,target:kim,targetStage:0,saidMarker:kim_similar=embarrassed,Just less dressed.
5-female_removing_minor,target:kim,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:shego=embarrassed,I-I mean, relationship as in friendship or rivalship?
5-female_removing_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:2=wink,I guess if it's strip poker, more layers would help... but I thought for sure it'd just be a sweatshirt, to fit in with your aesthetic!
5-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=bored,Oh, Kyoko…
5-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2=alarmed,Since they’re part of your body-- The wings, not the socks!
5-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:socks=embarrassed,Kyu wait! I'll take off something just so you don't have to if you'll---
5-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=alarmed,This is very interesting. But aren’t those kind of dirty? I-I mean not that being dirty is bad but--
5-female_removing_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:0=wink,Because you look really punk-y!
5-female_removing_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:2=alarmed,I-I’m excited to see more!
5-female_removing_minor,target:moon,targetStage:4=excited,Here I go! Begone! THOT!
5-female_removing_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=wink,I’m glad you’re having fun!
5-female_removing_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:1=excited,It’s great playing with you too, Nagisa!
5-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=excited,<i>Merveilleux! I</i> see what's going on here...
5-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2=excited,Jeez, ~player~, have you considered asking Natsuki on a date, or what?
5-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:1=bored,I never really understood the appeal of thongs.
5-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:1=wink,Sandals seem… Attire appropriate.
5-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4=wink,Of course, Palutena, I’m here to win too! (And at this point it looks like we’re having more fun than worry. Palutena does these asides too, so that’s okay for me, right?)
5-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4=wink,Not that you really need me to, but I won’t let you fall under the akuma’s power!
5-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:neo=confident,Palutena, I know Neo is pint-sized, but we should focus on making sure we can take her down… But if you don’t want me to go easy on you...
5-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:shego=confident,Er… I’m not going to go easy on you, Palutena, but I think Shego is a bigger problem if we don’t stop her now.
5-female_removing_minor,target:pearl,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Not in a bad way, just in a way that seems enchanted.
5-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika=wink,The bad guys better watch out!
5-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2=confused,Um. If you even want to take off your shoes... er... which you halready lave-- already have! Y-you risk showing your-- um. You know.
5-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2=bored,I-I guess you've already shown your underwear on accident-- um, is that the wrong thing to say?!
5-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba,saidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba=excited,"Pwn?" Er... well, I'm guessing if we got loaded up on sugar and got all dressed up, getting competitive does seem a <i>little</i> fun... What do you think, Saki?
5-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=confident,Hmm… I mean, I’ve done <i>saunas</i> but… Err, well, okay, let’s do this, but we have to do some skincare and go for crepes afterwards.
5-female_removing_minor,target:sanako,targetStage:0=calm,(Hmm... she seems oddly familiar...)
5-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=confused,A "soul gem?" Hmm... is that where you store your guardian spirit to transform?
5-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=calm,Hmm... Well, I guess there's other types of heroes out there... other types of girls with magic too, I suppose!
5-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:0=calm,I'm glad Sayori is so excitable! Even if she's a bit spacy.
5-female_removing_minor,target:shego,targetStage:0=confident,You may not use an akuma, but I'll stop you anyway!
5-female_removing_minor,target:shego,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei=confident,Sei, can you just arrest Shego? I’d like to see her tied up. I-I mean behind bars.
5-female_removing_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=alarmed,F-flooding? <i>D-de l'eau dans vos chaussette?</i> Um... I-is this a euphemism?
5-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=wink,This whole thing's a little awkward but let’s try to stay calm and collected, okay?
5-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=alarmed,Um. I can't say I've ever had to worry about it. Sometimes afterwards, but never during! I guess it's a side effect of my Miraculous?
5-female_removing_minor,target:weiss,targetStage:2=wink,Not that anyone here seems to care about your money but you.
5-female_removed_minor=alarmed,You must be working for Hawk Moth.
5-female_removed_minor=embarrassed,I had just hoped I’d be recognized for something like designing clothes, or saving the world.
5-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:sonya,alsoPlayingStage:6,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:commando=embarrassed,Whoa, Sonya. That's... Wow, body paint. I didn't think I was into this. I guess I am, though.
5-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:zoey,notSaidMarker:rodeo,marker:rodeo=confused,Zoey, what do you mean by rodeo?
5-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:zoey,notSaidMarker:shimmy,marker:shimmy=wink,Shimmy? Oh! That’s a fun word to say! Shimmy... Shimmy... Shimmy... Erk. Sorry, ~name~, I got distracted...
5-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:6,marker:ztentacles=confident,I’m sure, even faced with a tentacle monster, ~name~ would hold her ground, Zone! No wardrobe destruction. Or. Um. Destruction of orifices.
5-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=bored,Erm, Aimee... This seems very, very dangerous. And if a hero is telling you that...
5-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,At very least, I don't have to worry about you as a villain... You seem to only hit yourself...
5-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:huey=confident,Don’t worry, Florina! I’m sure Huey was safely out of range!
5-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=confused,A-Aimee, I'd use my Lucky Charm to reverse time if you made a mistake, but there's no akumas here for me to use it on...
5-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=alarmed,A-Aimee, I might die of embarrassment, but if you do that wrong, you'll actually die!
5-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=alarmed,Aimee! You sure aren’t making sounds like that was a sure shot! Be careful!
5-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=embarrassed,Erm. If you do though, could you please <i>not</i> bring it here?
5-female_removed_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:2=confident,Hmm... Maybe now's not a great time, but could you do... Fashion Victim by Green Day?
5-female_removed_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:5=confident,Alpha, I know you're digital but... You're pretty and definitely express your personality well. That's all you.
5-female_removed_minor,target:blackrose,targetStage:3=confident,Wow! Those are cool tattoos, Blackrose!
5-female_removed_minor,target:blackrose,targetStage:3=embarrassed,U-um, those are tattoos, right? Those wavy things, and not scars? R-right?
5-female_removed_minor,target:blake,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:aimee=embarrassed,H-hey Aimee! I-I just work with someone that's just as cute--I mean looks like her!
5-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:1=embarrassed,O-oh. Well, this is embarrassing. I’m not really used to… Um… A scenario where something like you wasn’t just possessed.
5-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:alpha=embarrassed,Well, I guess Alpha is an AI that’s not possessed… I think. I’m keeping an eye on you, Chica.
5-female_removed_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:4=wink,It certainly seems to help fight off <i>your</i> Akuma. I figured it'd help me with mine!
5-female_removed_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:4=wink,I mean, you <i>did</i> just take off your boots.
5-female_removed_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:4=wink,I'd be happy to show you some tricks of my own, if you'd like!
5-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=wink,I really think well-made armor can keep you really mobile, right? Maybe just not as mobile as me.
5-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=confident,I'm really not one for armor, but my suit does really increase my pain tolerance and agility.
5-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=wink,I'd say you're finally coming out of your shell, Corrin, but you definitely seem fine with this.
5-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:3=wink,(She looks kind of like a frillier, female Adrien... Hmm...)
5-female_removed_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:3=alarmed,W-whoa! You really didn't need to bring so many guns, Elaine!
5-female_removed_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:3=alarmed,I-I'm glad you're retting gid--getting rid of those guns, Elaine!
5-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:2,totalMales:1-5=wink,I think most people know a breastplate is also a chestplate. Don’t get so worried, Florina!
5-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:lyn=calm,Aww! You two are so sweet on each other!
5-female_removed_minor,target:florina,totalExposed:1-5=confident,I understand how you feel, Florina, but nothing’s wrong. You’re doing great!
5-female_removed_minor,target:gogo,targetStage:3=confused,That sounds really embarrassing... Is that why you're so... O-oh. N-nevermind.
5-female_removed_minor,target:gogo,targetStage:3=embarrassed,W-wait a second, t-that's-- That's so vulgar, GoGo!
5-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3=excited,Well! I applaud you being so clever! I’m definitely not sure what it would be like to take mine off piecemeal like that.
5-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba=confused,Futaba, I mean… I'm still interested in men but Gwen’s… Impressive in her own right...
5-female_removed_minor,target:kim,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:shego=calm,It's not like I haven't had a similar bond with some of the villains I've fought...
5-female_removed_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:3=excited,You look so cute, Kimberly! I-I get a little embarrassed when I bare my midriff, but you make it look great! E-er, you know what I mean.
5-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=confused,I’m so sorry. I wish my Lucky Charm could heal those. You’re still an amazing detective, I can tell even from this game…
5-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=embarrassed,Um. Are your wings sensitive, Kyu?
5-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:socks=confused,W-wait a minute! You shouldn't threaten self-harm like that!
5-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4=excited,Um, what about your mouth? It’s very cute but <i>I’d</i> rather the only dirty parts be your language.
5-female_removed_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:1=embarrassed,N-no?
5-female_removed_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:3=embarrassed,J-just because I don’t get a lot of chances to look at body art. But even without the art you’re really… You know…
5-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=embarrassed,O-oh. I guess it didn’t work… Maybe she meant Thoth, like that Egyptian god the Pharaoh channeled?
5-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=confused,Um...I don’t know about that. Maybe you’re a warmer person than me?
5-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2=wink,I-I mean. I don't know what's going on. I wouldn't come to a game like this for <i>Adrien</i> or anything. Um. I guess a girl has to have her secrets, huh, Natsuki?
5-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=wink,You're really lucky Natsuki's so brave! This is usually a third or fourth date activity, and she's willing to do all this for <i>you</i>! It's romantic! In a way.
5-female_removed_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=confused,Er... if you want to stop, Nayru, I think most people here would be okay with it... no need to push yourself!
5-female_removed_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=excited,You seem like a weight's off your chest! What happened, Nayru?
5-female_removed_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:3=confident,They’re very classy, Nugi-chan. I recognize high quality clothing anywhere, and I’ll make sure they’re treated well!
5-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:2=embarrassed,I-I do mean sandals. M-meaning sandals are fine for the beach and your clothes, I just don’t like them. I-I’m not looking at your… Butt.
5-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:2=excited,I’ve never really seen a statuesque person undress before, so this is a bit novel to me.
5-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:5=embarrassed,Palutena, I do have to wonder what a goddess looks like under her um...last lines of defense.
5-female_removed_minor,target:pearl,targetStage:2=calm,And you certainly seem enchanting! I guess if you're not Akumatized, you're alright by me!
5-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika=confident,And with Nadeshiko helping you out, you already have a super strong team!
5-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3=wink,Okay, okay, okay. Saki, how about a hug? If you're cold or embarrassed, nothing fixes both like a big hug. And believe me, I need lots of hugs!
5-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba,saidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba=wink,Then we can talk about boys and stuff too. I actually already like Futaba's style, and I'm already kind of good at some games, so it's a great blend for Saki!
5-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=wink,Um, yeah! Well, crepes and mudmasks and all that are popular wherever you go, right? This'll be great!
5-female_removed_minor,target:sanako,targetStage:1=embarrassed,This is somewhat odd to admit, but this isn't my first visit here... you seem very familiar, Sanako, but I don't think I can place how...
5-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=calm,Well, my earrings are <i>kind of</i> like that gem of yours... does your kwami have a name?
5-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:3=wink,I'm glad one of us doesn't <i>seem</i> too concerned with losing. Don't worry. If you don't get your "grief seed," I'll make sure I do get my <i>akuma</i>.
5-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1=wink,I'm just really happy you have it together, Sayori! I have some other people to watch out for so they don't get Akumatized, but I'm glad you're emotionally stable!
5-female_removed_minor,target:shego,targetStage:1=bored,One piece of clothing at a time! Er... Hopefully losing here will make you rethink things?
5-female_removed_minor,target:shego,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei=embarrassed,I could tie her up with my yo-yo but I think she’d like that far too much...
5-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=embarrassed,U-uhm. That looked hot! I mean, hot as not as your-- n-not as hot as-- um, when you had burnmarks-- er--!
5-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:uravity=embarrassed,I guess we're both kind of lost in this, huh, Ochako...?
5-female_removed_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:3=alarmed,Er… about that… Er! H-hold on, don't panic, I can explain!
5-female_removed_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:2,marker:feet=bored,I mean, you’re an attractive woman taking off her clothes… Wait, did you mean… Your feet?
5-female_removed_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:2,marker:feet=confused,Er… What, the feet? Is this a thing people…


#lost pants
6-male_removing_minor=bored,Oh. I-, um. I guess that’s okay.
6-male_removing_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:0=bored,<i>And costume for…</i> Oh.

6-male_removing_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2=embarrassed,E-er. Hm. I think I prefer men that are a bit more... masculine.
6-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Tamokoma Branch? Is that like... your hero organization? The trivia's fine, Jin. Kind of like the rest of you... Er--

6-male_removing_minor,target:pit,targetStage:2=embarrassed,The rest of you looks much better. Um. Especially the... Not clothes parts.
6-male_removing_minor,target:pit,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:palutena=embarrassed,Yeah, sandals are a bit... Um. (How do I say they're not attractive without being really mean?)
6-male_removed_minor=confident,If it were Adrien, I might make an exception... But it seems a bit rude that’s all you’re taking off at this point!
6-male_removed_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:1=embarrassed,O-oh my. You’re very striking under that helmet, Captain America. (<i>Ca valait la peine.</i>)
6-male_removed_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:3=confident,Hmm. I-I was kind of expecting a different answer! (Tellement pour espérer qu'il allait me dire.)
6-male_removed_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:3=wink,I think you can be gentle without being weak or cowardly. Don't lose the first part, Corrin.
6-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3=wink,I suppose there's something to be said about self-servicing... er... fashion design-wise, anyway.
6-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:4=confused,Huh? What's a Trion body? Is that kind of like my transformation and powers?
6-male_removed_minor,target:pit,targetStage:3=alarmed,A-anyway, let's keep playing! D-don't pay me too much mind!
6-male_removed_minor,target:pit,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:palutena=bored,Hmm. (I can't figure these two out! I've known Tikki for a long time, but I'm guessing divine figures are just like this!)
6-female_removing_minor=alarmed,I had thought there was an akuma here…
6-female_removing_minor=bored,Oh. I-, um. I guess that’s okay.
6-female_removing_minor,alsoPlaying:zoey,alsoPlayingStage:2=alarmed,HBO? Wait, this isn’t on TV? W-wait, HBO has things like this on it?
6-female_removing_minor,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:2,marker:ztentacles=alarmed,Um. People can enjoy sex however they want, Zone-tan, but I think most people prefer not to have their wardrobes damaged in the process!

6-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=alarmed,Ahh!!! Could you stop shooting like that!
6-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=confident,It is a pretty impressive skill, at least. But please don't hurt anyone!
6-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:florina=embarrassed,Er, I meant--You know, morally. Not...Mortally. Erk.
6-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=wink,Oh! Is this what people mean when they say they want to shoot all over me? Is this just how some people undress in those old Western movies? ?
6-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=confident,O-Okay. I'll go ahead and hope you know how to use... Whatever skill you're using.
6-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=alarmed,Don’t encourage her, Zone! You don’t have some big amorphous blob that can shield us with tentacles!
6-female_removing_minor,target:amalia,targetStage:2=embarrassed,Though... I haven't really seen a Miraculous compartmentalize like this...
6-female_removing_minor,target:ann,targetStage:0=confident,I've seen so many of your shoots! You really, really know how to own your apparel!
6-female_removing_minor,target:april,targetStage:1=excited,But I don’t know if the turtle miraculous holder likes pizza that much... or sewers. He definitely knows a lot about Ancient China though!
6-female_removing_minor,target:ayano,notSaidMarker:ayano_stripping=confused,It’s just ~clothing~, Ayano. I think you’re overreacting. (I’m going to keep an eye out for any butterflies, just in case... This seems bad.)
6-female_removing_minor,target:ayano,saidMarker:ayano_stripping=alarmed,It looks like you spend just as much time playing cards as you do practicing empathy, Ayano.
6-female_removing_minor,target:blake,targetStage:2=embarrassed,So given how things are going, maybe I should kiss you for luck?
6-female_removing_minor,target:blake,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:yang=wink,O-or if you aren’t, that’s okay too? Everyone has secrets! Love or otherwise.
6-female_removing_minor,target:chica,targetStage:0=alarmed,W-wait, that’s the one with the possessed animatronics! I have to free Chica from the Akuma, now!
6-female_removing_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:3=alarmed,Um, but. I, er. Spinning bird kick. Can you teach it to me?
6-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=calm,Those actually look really well made! I'm not one for armor, but it's nice to see you care about more than durability.
6-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:0=excited,Wow, Corrin, those look really stylish and actually durable!
6-female_removing_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:2=alarmed,O-oh. I-is that so? Hm.

6-female_removing_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:2=alarmed,Y-your... Husband? D-does he know you're at a game like this!?
6-female_removing_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:2=alarmed,I-I would never come here if I had a partner at home!
6-female_removing_minor,target:gogo,targetStage:2=calm,But that’s a good thing. You’re just like Chloe, and you’re so mean I can’t imagine you’d have nice powers.
6-female_removing_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:2=bored,Oh.
6-female_removing_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba=embarrassed,Er. We're not-- I'm not-- I mean, she's really pretty but--! I mean I would be <i>interested</i>
6-female_removing_minor,target:juri,targetStage:1=confused,Oh! Your gloves! Here I was thinking you'd take off your hairties or something.
6-female_removing_minor,target:kim,targetStage:0,saidMarker:kim_similar=embarrassed,Just less dressed.
6-female_removing_minor,target:kim,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:shego=embarrassed,I-I mean, relationship as in friendship or rivalship?
6-female_removing_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:2=wink,I guess if it's strip poker, more layers would help... but I thought for sure it'd just be a sweatshirt, to fit in with your aesthetic!
6-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=bored,Oh, Kyoko…
6-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2=confident,Oh! <i>Oui!</i> You have really good legs for someone who can fly

6-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:1=bored,I never really understood the appeal of thongs.
6-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:1=wink,Sandals seem… Attire appropriate.
6-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4=wink,Of course, Palutena, I’m here to win too! (And at this point it looks like we’re having more fun than worry. Palutena does these asides too, so that’s okay for me, right?)
6-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4=wink,Not that you really need me to, but I won’t let you fall under the akuma’s power!
6-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:neo=confident,Palutena, I know Neo is pint-sized, but we should focus on making sure we can take her down… But if you don’t want me to go easy on you...
6-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:shego=confident,Er… I’m not going to go easy on you, Palutena, but I think Shego is a bigger problem if we don’t stop her now.
6-female_removing_minor,target:pearl,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Not in a bad way, just in a way that seems enchanted.
6-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika=wink,The bad guys better watch out!
6-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2=confused,Um. If you even want to take off your shoes... er... which you halready lave-- already have! Y-you risk showing your-- um. You know.
6-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2=bored,I-I guess you've already shown your underwear on accident-- um, is that the wrong thing to say?!
6-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba,saidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba=excited,"Pwn?" Er... well, I'm guessing if we got loaded up on sugar and got all dressed up, getting competitive does seem a <i>little</i> fun... What do you think, Saki?
6-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=confident,Hmm… I mean, I’ve done <i>saunas</i> but… Err, well, okay, let’s do this, but we have to do some skincare and go for crepes afterwards.
6-female_removing_minor,target:sanako,targetStage:0=calm,(Hmm... she seems oddly familiar...)
6-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:1=confused,A "soul gem?" Hmm... is that where you store your guardian spirit to transform?
6-female_removing_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=calm,Hmm... Well, I guess there's other types of heroes out there... other types of girls with magic too, I suppose!
6-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:0=calm,I'm glad Sayori is so excitable! Even if she's a bit spacy.
6-female_removing_minor,target:shego,targetStage:0=confident,You may not use an akuma, but I'll stop you anyway!
6-female_removing_minor,target:shego,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei=confident,Sei, can you just arrest Shego? I’d like to see her tied up. I-I mean behind bars.
6-female_removing_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=alarmed,F-flooding? <i>D-de l'eau dans vos chaussette?</i> Um... I-is this a euphemism?
6-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=wink,This whole thing's a little awkward but let’s try to stay calm and collected, okay?
6-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=alarmed,Um. I can't say I've ever had to worry about it. Sometimes afterwards, but never during! I guess it's a side effect of my Miraculous?
6-female_removing_minor,target:weiss,targetStage:2=wink,Not that anyone here seems to care about your money but you.
6-female_removed_minor=confused,But I’ve never seen an akuma take over clothing that small before.
6-female_removed_minor=wink,At least the game is kind of fun. A little bit.
6-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:sonya,alsoPlayingStage:6,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:commando=embarrassed,Whoa, Sonya. That's... Wow, body paint. I didn't think I was into this. I guess I am, though.
6-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:zoey,notSaidMarker:rodeo,marker:rodeo=confused,Zoey, what do you mean by rodeo?
6-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:zoey,notSaidMarker:shimmy,marker:shimmy=wink,Shimmy? Oh! That’s a fun word to say! Shimmy... Shimmy... Shimmy... Erk. Sorry, ~name~, I got distracted...
6-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:6,marker:ztentacles=confident,I’m sure, even faced with a tentacle monster, ~name~ would hold her ground, Zone! No wardrobe destruction. Or. Um. Destruction of orifices.
6-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=bored,Erm, Aimee... This seems very, very dangerous. And if a hero is telling you that...
6-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,At very least, I don't have to worry about you as a villain... You seem to only hit yourself...
6-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:huey=confident,Don’t worry, Florina! I’m sure Huey was safely out of range!
6-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=confused,A-Aimee, I'd use my Lucky Charm to reverse time if you made a mistake, but there's no akumas here for me to use it on...
6-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=alarmed,A-Aimee, I might die of embarrassment, but if you do that wrong, you'll actually die!
6-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=alarmed,Aimee! You sure aren’t making sounds like that was a sure shot! Be careful!
6-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=embarrassed,Erm. If you do though, could you please <i>not</i> bring it here?
6-female_removed_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:2=confident,Hmm... Maybe now's not a great time, but could you do... Fashion Victim by Green Day?
6-female_removed_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:5=confident,Alpha, I know you're digital but... You're pretty and definitely express your personality well. That's all you.
6-female_removed_minor,target:blackrose,targetStage:3=confident,Wow! Those are cool tattoos, Blackrose!
6-female_removed_minor,target:blackrose,targetStage:3=embarrassed,U-um, those are tattoos, right? Those wavy things, and not scars? R-right?
6-female_removed_minor,target:blake,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:aimee=embarrassed,H-hey Aimee! I-I just work with someone that's just as cute--I mean looks like her!
6-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:1=embarrassed,O-oh. Well, this is embarrassing. I’m not really used to… Um… A scenario where something like you wasn’t just possessed.
6-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:alpha=embarrassed,Well, I guess Alpha is an AI that’s not possessed… I think. I’m keeping an eye on you, Chica.
6-female_removed_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:4=wink,It certainly seems to help fight off <i>your</i> Akuma. I figured it'd help me with mine!
6-female_removed_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:4=wink,I mean, you <i>did</i> just take off your boots.
6-female_removed_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:4=wink,I'd be happy to show you some tricks of my own, if you'd like!
6-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=wink,I really think well-made armor can keep you really mobile, right? Maybe just not as mobile as me.
6-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=confident,I'm really not one for armor, but my suit does really increase my pain tolerance and agility.
6-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=wink,I'd say you're finally coming out of your shell, Corrin, but you definitely seem fine with this.
6-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:3=wink,(She looks kind of like a frillier, female Adrien... Hmm...)
6-female_removed_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:3=alarmed,W-whoa! You really didn't need to bring so many guns, Elaine!
6-female_removed_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:3=alarmed,I-I'm glad you're retting gid--getting rid of those guns, Elaine!
6-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:2,totalMales:1-5=wink,I think most people know a breastplate is also a chestplate. Don’t get so worried, Florina!
6-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:lyn=calm,Aww! You two are so sweet on each other!
6-female_removed_minor,target:florina,totalExposed:1-5=confident,I understand how you feel, Florina, but nothing’s wrong. You’re doing great!
6-female_removed_minor,target:gogo,targetStage:3=confused,That sounds really embarrassing... Is that why you're so... O-oh. N-nevermind.
6-female_removed_minor,target:gogo,targetStage:3=embarrassed,W-wait a second, t-that's-- That's so vulgar, GoGo!
6-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3=excited,Well! I applaud you being so clever! I’m definitely not sure what it would be like to take mine off piecemeal like that.
6-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba=confused,Futaba, I mean… I'm still interested in men but Gwen’s… Impressive in her own right...
6-female_removed_minor,target:kim,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:shego=calm,It's not like I haven't had a similar bond with some of the villains I've fought...
6-female_removed_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:3=excited,You look so cute, Kimberly! I-I get a little embarrassed when I bare my midriff, but you make it look great! E-er, you know what I mean.
6-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=confused,I’m so sorry. I wish my Lucky Charm could heal those. You’re still an amazing detective, I can tell even from this game…
6-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=excited,I run and jump a lot to get this toned, I’m a bit jealous you’re naturally like that.
6-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:socks=confused,W-wait a minute! You shouldn't threaten self-harm like that!
6-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4=embarrassed,I-I tend to get a little nervous when I’m exposed like this. You’re definitely making my night, I <i>pink</i>.
6-female_removed_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:1=embarrassed,N-no?
6-female_removed_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:3=embarrassed,J-just because I don’t get a lot of chances to look at body art. But even without the art you’re really… You know…
6-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=embarrassed,O-oh. I guess it didn’t work… Maybe she meant Thoth, like that Egyptian god the Pharaoh channeled?
6-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=confused,Um...I don’t know about that. Maybe you’re a warmer person than me?
6-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2=wink,I-I mean. I don't know what's going on. I wouldn't come to a game like this for <i>Adrien</i> or anything. Um. I guess a girl has to have her secrets, huh, Natsuki?
6-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=wink,You're really lucky Natsuki's so brave! This is usually a third or fourth date activity, and she's willing to do all this for <i>you</i>! It's romantic! In a way.
6-female_removed_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=confused,Er... if you want to stop, Nayru, I think most people here would be okay with it... no need to push yourself!
6-female_removed_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=excited,You seem like a weight's off your chest! What happened, Nayru?
6-female_removed_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:3=confident,They’re very classy, Nugi-chan. I recognize high quality clothing anywhere, and I’ll make sure they’re treated well!
6-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:2=embarrassed,I-I do mean sandals. M-meaning sandals are fine for the beach and your clothes, I just don’t like them. I-I’m not looking at your… Butt.
6-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:2=excited,I’ve never really seen a statuesque person undress before, so this is a bit novel to me.
6-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:5=embarrassed,Palutena, I do have to wonder what a goddess looks like under her um...last lines of defense.
6-female_removed_minor,target:pearl,targetStage:2=calm,And you certainly seem enchanting! I guess if you're not Akumatized, you're alright by me!
6-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika=confident,And with Nadeshiko helping you out, you already have a super strong team!
6-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3=wink,Okay, okay, okay. Saki, how about a hug? If you're cold or embarrassed, nothing fixes both like a big hug. And believe me, I need lots of hugs!
6-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba,saidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba=wink,Then we can talk about boys and stuff too. I actually already like Futaba's style, and I'm already kind of good at some games, so it's a great blend for Saki!
6-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=wink,Um, yeah! Well, crepes and mudmasks and all that are popular wherever you go, right? This'll be great!
6-female_removed_minor,target:sanako,targetStage:1=embarrassed,This is somewhat odd to admit, but this isn't my first visit here... you seem very familiar, Sanako, but I don't think I can place how...
6-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=calm,Well, my earrings are <i>kind of</i> like that gem of yours... does your kwami have a name?
6-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:3=wink,I'm glad one of us doesn't <i>seem</i> too concerned with losing. Don't worry. If you don't get your "grief seed," I'll make sure I do get my <i>akuma</i>.
6-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1=wink,I'm just really happy you have it together, Sayori! I have some other people to watch out for so they don't get Akumatized, but I'm glad you're emotionally stable!
6-female_removed_minor,target:shego,targetStage:1=bored,One piece of clothing at a time! Er... Hopefully losing here will make you rethink things?
6-female_removed_minor,target:shego,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei=embarrassed,I could tie her up with my yo-yo but I think she’d like that far too much...
6-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=embarrassed,U-uhm. That looked hot! I mean, hot as not as your-- n-not as hot as-- um, when you had burnmarks-- er--!
6-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:uravity=embarrassed,I guess we're both kind of lost in this, huh, Ochako...?
6-female_removed_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:3=alarmed,Er… about that… Er! H-hold on, don't panic, I can explain!
6-female_removed_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:2,marker:feet=bored,I mean, you’re an attractive woman taking off her clothes… Wait, did you mean… Your feet?
6-female_removed_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:2,marker:feet=confused,Er… What, the feet? Is this a thing people…

7-male_removed_minor,target:captain_america,targetStage:3=alarmed,Maybe we should do some more practice, after this? Y-you know, in superheroics. Not strip poker. B-but if you really wanted, we totally could-! Ah! Nevermind, the lights here are just really bright and I’m going to stop talking.
7-male_removed_minor,target:corrin_m,targetStage:3=wink,I think you can be gentle without being weak or cowardly. Don't lose the first part, Corrin.
7-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3=alarmed,--oir... Uh... this is kind of awkward... S-sorry, Jin, at least it's a flattering comparison?
7-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:4=confused,Huh? What's a Trion body? Is that kind of like my transformation and powers?
7-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:4=alarmed,I'm really much better at this when I'm in costume. Er... the flirting and such. It helps when the boy's in his costume too, though!
7-male_removed_minor,target:pit,targetStage:3=alarmed,A-anyway, let's keep playing! D-don't pay me too much mind!
7-male_removed_minor,target:pit,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:palutena=bored,Hmm. (I can't figure these two out! I've known Tikki for a long time, but I'm guessing divine figures are just like this!)

7-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4=wink,Of course, Palutena, I’m here to win too! (And at this point it looks like we’re having more fun than worry. Palutena does these asides too, so that’s okay for me, right?)
7-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4=wink,Not that you really need me to, but I won’t let you fall under the akuma’s power!
7-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:neo=confident,Palutena, I know Neo is pint-sized, but we should focus on making sure we can take her down… But if you don’t want me to go easy on you...
7-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:shego=confident,Er… I’m not going to go easy on you, Palutena, but I think Shego is a bigger problem if we don’t stop her now.
7-female_removing_minor,target:pearl,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Not in a bad way, just in a way that seems enchanted.
7-female_removing_minor,target:rainbow_mika=wink,The bad guys better watch out!

7-female_removing_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:0=calm,I'm glad Sayori is so excitable! Even if she's a bit spacy.

7-female_removing_minor,target:shego,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:sei=confident,Sei, can you just arrest Shego? I’d like to see her tied up. I-I mean behind bars.
7-female_removing_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:2=alarmed,F-flooding? <i>D-de l'eau dans vos chaussette?</i> Um... I-is this a euphemism?
7-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=wink,This whole thing's a little awkward but let’s try to stay calm and collected, okay?
7-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=alarmed,Um. I can't say I've ever had to worry about it. Sometimes afterwards, but never during! I guess it's a side effect of my Miraculous?
7-female_removing_minor,target:weiss,targetStage:2=wink,Not that anyone here seems to care about your money but you.
7-female_removed_minor=confused,It’s miraculous that you’re so far ahead...
7-female_removed_minor=embarrassed,But I think losing your ~clothing~ is making me excited?
7-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:sonya,alsoPlayingStage:6,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:commando=embarrassed,Whoa, Sonya. That's... Wow, body paint. I didn't think I was into this. I guess I am, though.
7-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:zoey,notSaidMarker:rodeo,marker:rodeo=confused,Zoey, what do you mean by rodeo?
7-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:zoey,notSaidMarker:shimmy,marker:shimmy=wink,Shimmy? Oh! That’s a fun word to say! Shimmy... Shimmy... Shimmy... Erk. Sorry, ~name~, I got distracted...
7-female_removed_minor,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:6,marker:ztentacles=confident,I’m sure, even faced with a tentacle monster, ~name~ would hold her ground, Zone! No wardrobe destruction. Or. Um. Destruction of orifices.
7-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=bored,Erm, Aimee... This seems very, very dangerous. And if a hero is telling you that...
7-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2=excited,At very least, I don't have to worry about you as a villain... You seem to only hit yourself...
7-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:huey=confident,Don’t worry, Florina! I’m sure Huey was safely out of range!
7-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=confused,A-Aimee, I'd use my Lucky Charm to reverse time if you made a mistake, but there's no akumas here for me to use it on...
7-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=alarmed,A-Aimee, I might die of embarrassment, but if you do that wrong, you'll actually die!
7-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=alarmed,Aimee! You sure aren’t making sounds like that was a sure shot! Be careful!
7-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=embarrassed,Erm. If you do though, could you please <i>not</i> bring it here?
7-female_removed_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:2=confident,Hmm... Maybe now's not a great time, but could you do... Fashion Victim by Green Day?
7-female_removed_minor,target:alpha,targetStage:5=confident,Alpha, I know you're digital but... You're pretty and definitely express your personality well. That's all you.
7-female_removed_minor,target:blackrose,targetStage:3=confident,Wow! Those are cool tattoos, Blackrose!
7-female_removed_minor,target:blackrose,targetStage:3=embarrassed,U-um, those are tattoos, right? Those wavy things, and not scars? R-right?
7-female_removed_minor,target:blake,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:aimee=embarrassed,H-hey Aimee! I-I just work with someone that's just as cute--I mean looks like her!
7-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:1=embarrassed,O-oh. Well, this is embarrassing. I’m not really used to… Um… A scenario where something like you wasn’t just possessed.
7-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:alpha=embarrassed,Well, I guess Alpha is an AI that’s not possessed… I think. I’m keeping an eye on you, Chica.
7-female_removed_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:4=wink,It certainly seems to help fight off <i>your</i> Akuma. I figured it'd help me with mine!
7-female_removed_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:4=wink,I mean, you <i>did</i> just take off your boots.
7-female_removed_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:4=wink,I'd be happy to show you some tricks of my own, if you'd like!
7-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=wink,I really think well-made armor can keep you really mobile, right? Maybe just not as mobile as me.
7-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=confident,I'm really not one for armor, but my suit does really increase my pain tolerance and agility.
7-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=wink,I'd say you're finally coming out of your shell, Corrin, but you definitely seem fine with this.
7-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:3=wink,(She looks kind of like a frillier, female Adrien... Hmm...)

7-female_removed_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:3=alarmed,I-I'm glad you're retting gid--getting rid of those guns, Elaine!
7-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:2,totalMales:1-5=wink,I think most people know a breastplate is also a chestplate. Don’t get so worried, Florina!

7-female_removed_minor,target:florina,totalExposed:1-5=confident,I understand how you feel, Florina, but nothing’s wrong. You’re doing great!
7-female_removed_minor,target:gogo,targetStage:3=confused,That sounds really embarrassing... Is that why you're so... O-oh. N-nevermind.
7-female_removed_minor,target:gogo,targetStage:3=embarrassed,W-wait a second, t-that's-- That's so vulgar, GoGo!
7-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3=excited,Well! I applaud you being so clever! I’m definitely not sure what it would be like to take mine off piecemeal like that.
7-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba=confused,Futaba, I mean… I'm still interested in men but Gwen’s… Impressive in her own right...
7-female_removed_minor,target:kim,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:shego=calm,It's not like I haven't had a similar bond with some of the villains I've fought...
7-female_removed_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:3=excited,You look so cute, Kimberly! I-I get a little embarrassed when I bare my midriff, but you make it look great! E-er, you know what I mean.
7-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=confused,I’m so sorry. I wish my Lucky Charm could heal those. You’re still an amazing detective, I can tell even from this game…
7-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=excited,I run and jump a lot to get this toned, I’m a bit jealous you’re naturally like that.
7-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:socks=confused,W-wait a minute! You shouldn't threaten self-harm like that!
7-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4=embarrassed,I-I tend to get a little nervous when I’m exposed like this. You’re definitely making my night, I <i>pink</i>.
7-female_removed_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:1=embarrassed,N-no?
7-female_removed_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:3=embarrassed,J-just because I don’t get a lot of chances to look at body art. But even without the art you’re really… You know…
7-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=embarrassed,O-oh. I guess it didn’t work… Maybe she meant Thoth, like that Egyptian god the Pharaoh channeled?
7-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=confused,Um...I don’t know about that. Maybe you’re a warmer person than me?
7-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2=wink,I-I mean. I don't know what's going on. I wouldn't come to a game like this for <i>Adrien</i> or anything. Um. I guess a girl has to have her secrets, huh, Natsuki?
7-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=wink,You're really lucky Natsuki's so brave! This is usually a third or fourth date activity, and she's willing to do all this for <i>you</i>! It's romantic! In a way.
7-female_removed_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=confused,Er... if you want to stop, Nayru, I think most people here would be okay with it... no need to push yourself!
7-female_removed_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=excited,You seem like a weight's off your chest! What happened, Nayru?
7-female_removed_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:3=confident,They’re very classy, Nugi-chan. I recognize high quality clothing anywhere, and I’ll make sure they’re treated well!
7-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:2=embarrassed,I-I do mean sandals. M-meaning sandals are fine for the beach and your clothes, I just don’t like them. I-I’m not looking at your… Butt.
7-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:2=excited,I’ve never really seen a statuesque person undress before, so this is a bit novel to me.
7-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:5=embarrassed,Palutena, I do have to wonder what a goddess looks like under her um...last lines of defense.
7-female_removed_minor,target:pearl,targetStage:2=calm,And you certainly seem enchanting! I guess if you're not Akumatized, you're alright by me!
7-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika=confident,And with Nadeshiko helping you out, you already have a super strong team!
7-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3=wink,Okay, okay, okay. Saki, how about a hug? If you're cold or embarrassed, nothing fixes both like a big hug. And believe me, I need lots of hugs!
7-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba,saidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba=wink,Then we can talk about boys and stuff too.

7-female_removed_minor,target:sanako,targetStage:1=embarrassed,This is somewhat odd to admit, but this isn't my first visit here... you seem very familiar, Sanako, but I don't think I can place how...
7-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=calm,Well, my earrings are <i>kind of</i> like that gem of yours... does your kwami have a name?
7-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:3=wink,I'm glad one of us doesn't <i>seem</i> too concerned with losing. Don't worry. If you don't get your "grief seed," I'll make sure I do get my <i>akuma</i>.

7-female_removed_minor,target:shego,targetStage:1=bored,One piece of clothing at a time! Er... Hopefully losing here will make you rethink things?
7-female_removed_minor,target:shego,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei=embarrassed,I could tie her up with my yo-yo but I think she’d like that far too much...
7-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=embarrassed,U-uhm. That looked hot! I mean, hot as not as your-- n-not as hot as-- um, when you had burnmarks-- er--!
7-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:uravity=embarrassed,I guess we're both kind of lost in this, huh, Ochako...?
7-female_removed_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:3=alarmed,Er… about that… Er! H-hold on, don't panic, I can explain!
7-female_removed_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:2,marker:feet=bored,I mean, you’re an attractive woman taking off her clothes… Wait, did you mean… Your feet?

-3-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4=wink,Not that you really need me to, but I won’t let you fall under the akuma’s power!
-3-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:neo=confident,Palutena, I know Neo is pint-sized, but we should focus on making sure we can take her down… But if you don’t want me to go easy on you...

-3-female_removing_minor,target:tracer=embarrassed,It’d be nice to do that with you once I get my clothes back on, and a trip to London besides!

-3-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=alarmed,Um. I can't say I've ever had to worry about it. Sometimes afterwards, but never during! I guess it's a side effect of my Miraculous?
-3-female_removing_minor,target:weiss,targetStage:2=wink,Not that anyone here seems to care about your money but you.
-3-female_removed_minor=alarmed,Because looking at how bad this game is going, I definitely could use some cover.

-3-female_removed_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:3=confused,A-Aimee, I'd use my Lucky Charm to reverse time if you made a mistake, but there's no akumas here for me to use it on...

-3-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:1=embarrassed,O-oh. Well, this is embarrassing. I’m not really used to… Um… A scenario where something like you wasn’t just possessed.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:alpha=embarrassed,Well, I guess Alpha is an AI that’s not possessed… I think. I’m keeping an eye on you, Chica.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:4=wink,It certainly seems to help fight off <i>your</i> Akuma. I figured it'd help me with mine!

-3-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=confident,I'm really not one for armor, but my suit does really increase my pain tolerance and agility.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=wink,I'd say you're finally coming out of your shell, Corrin, but you definitely seem fine with this.

-3-female_removed_minor,target:kimberly,targetStage:3=excited,You look so cute, Kimberly! I-I get a little embarrassed when I bare my midriff, but you make it look great! E-er, you know what I mean.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=confused,I’m so sorry. I wish my Lucky Charm could heal those. You’re still an amazing detective, I can tell even from this game…
-3-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=excited,I run and jump a lot to get this toned, I’m a bit jealous you’re naturally like that.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:socks=confused,W-wait a minute! You shouldn't threaten self-harm like that!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4=embarrassed,I-I tend to get a little nervous when I’m exposed like this. You’re definitely making my night, I <i>pink</i>.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:1=embarrassed,N-no?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:3=embarrassed,J-just because I don’t get a lot of chances to look at body art. But even without the art you’re really… You know…
-3-female_removed_minor,target:moon,targetStage:5=embarrassed,O-oh. I guess it didn’t work… Maybe she meant Thoth, like that Egyptian god the Pharaoh channeled?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=confused,Um...I don’t know about that. Maybe you’re a warmer person than me?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2=wink,I-I mean. I don't know what's going on. I wouldn't come to a game like this for <i>Adrien</i> or anything. Um. I guess a girl has to have her secrets, huh, Natsuki?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=wink,You're really lucky Natsuki's so brave! This is usually a third or fourth date activity, and she's willing to do all this for <i>you</i>! It's romantic! In a way.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=confused,Er... if you want to stop, Nayru, I think most people here would be okay with it... no need to push yourself!

-3-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:2=embarrassed,I-I do mean sandals. M-meaning sandals are fine for the beach and your clothes, I just don’t like them. I-I’m not looking at your… Butt.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:2=excited,I’ve never really seen a statuesque person undress before, so this is a bit novel to me.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:5=embarrassed,Palutena, I do have to wonder what a goddess looks like under her um...last lines of defense.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:pearl,targetStage:2=calm,And you certainly seem enchanting! I guess if you're not Akumatized, you're alright by me!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika=confident,And with Nadeshiko helping you out, you already have a super strong team!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3=wink,Okay, okay, okay. Saki, how about a hug? If you're cold or embarrassed, nothing fixes both like a big hug. And believe me, I need lots of hugs!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba,saidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba=wink,Then we can talk about boys and stuff too.

-3-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=wink,Um, yeah! Well, crepes and mudmasks and all that are popular wherever you go, right? This'll be great!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:sanako,targetStage:1=embarrassed,This is somewhat odd to admit, but this isn't my first visit here... you seem very familiar, Sanako, but I don't think I can place how...
-3-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=calm,Well, my earrings are <i>kind of</i> like that gem of yours... does your kwami have a name?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:3=wink,I'm glad one of us doesn't <i>seem</i> too concerned with losing. Don't worry. If you don't get your "grief seed," I'll make sure I do get my <i>akuma</i>.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1=wink,I'm just really happy you have it together, Sayori! I have some other people to watch out for so they don't get Akumatized, but I'm glad you're emotionally stable!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:shego,targetStage:1=bored,One piece of clothing at a time! Er... Hopefully losing here will make you rethink things?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:shego,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei=embarrassed,I could tie her up with my yo-yo but I think she’d like that far too much...
-3-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=embarrassed,U-uhm. That looked hot! I mean, hot as not as your-- n-not as hot as-- um, when you had burnmarks-- er--!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:uravity=embarrassed,I guess we're both kind of lost in this, huh, Ochako...?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:3=alarmed,Er… about that… Er! H-hold on, don't panic, I can explain!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:2,marker:feet=bored,I mean, you’re an attractive woman taking off her clothes… Wait, did you mean… Your feet?

-2-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4=wink,Not that you really need me to, but I won’t let you fall under the akuma’s power!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:neo=confident,Palutena, I know Neo is pint-sized, but we should focus on making sure we can take her down… But if you don’t want me to go easy on you...
-2-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:shego=confident,Er… I’m not going to go easy on you, Palutena, but I think Shego is a bigger problem if we don’t stop her now.

-2-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=wink,This whole thing's a little awkward but let’s try to stay calm and collected, okay?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=alarmed,Um. I can't say I've ever had to worry about it. Sometimes afterwards, but never during! I guess it's a side effect of my Miraculous?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:weiss,targetStage:2=wink,Not that anyone here seems to care about your money but you.
-2-female_removed_minor=embarrassed,B-but if you took off more that’d help... more?

-2-female_removed_minor,target:blake,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:aimee=embarrassed,H-hey Aimee! I-I just work with someone that's just as cute--I mean looks like her!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:1=embarrassed,O-oh. Well, this is embarrassing. I’m not really used to… Um… A scenario where something like you wasn’t just possessed.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:chica,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:alpha=embarrassed,Well, I guess Alpha is an AI that’s not possessed… I think. I’m keeping an eye on you, Chica.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:4=wink,It certainly seems to help fight off <i>your</i> Akuma. I figured it'd help me with mine!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:4=wink,I mean, you <i>did</i> just take off your boots.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:chun-li,targetStage:4=wink,I'd be happy to show you some tricks of my own, if you'd like!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=wink,I really think well-made armor can keep you really mobile, right? Maybe just not as mobile as me.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=confident,I'm really not one for armor, but my suit does really increase my pain tolerance and agility.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=wink,I'd say you're finally coming out of your shell, Corrin, but you definitely seem fine with this.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:dark_magician_girl,targetStage:3=wink,(She looks kind of like a frillier, female Adrien... Hmm...)
-2-female_removed_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:3=alarmed,W-whoa! You really didn't need to bring so many guns, Elaine!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:elaine,targetStage:3=alarmed,I-I'm glad you're retting gid--getting rid of those guns, Elaine!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:2,totalMales:1-5=wink,I think most people know a breastplate is also a chestplate. Don’t get so worried, Florina!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:lyn=calm,Aww! You two are so sweet on each other!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:florina,totalExposed:1-5=confident,I understand how you feel, Florina, but nothing’s wrong. You’re doing great!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:gogo,targetStage:3=confused,That sounds really embarrassing... Is that why you're so... O-oh. N-nevermind.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:gogo,targetStage:3=embarrassed,W-wait a second, t-that's-- That's so vulgar, GoGo!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3=excited,Well! I applaud you being so clever! I’m definitely not sure what it would be like to take mine off piecemeal like that.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba=confused,Futaba, I mean… I'm still interested in men but Gwen’s… Impressive in her own right...
-2-female_removed_minor,target:kim,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:shego=calm,It's not like I haven't had a similar bond with some of the villains I've fought...

-2-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=confused,I’m so sorry. I wish my Lucky Charm could heal those. You’re still an amazing detective, I can tell even from this game…
-2-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=excited,I run and jump a lot to get this toned, I’m a bit jealous you’re naturally like that.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:socks=confused,W-wait a minute! You shouldn't threaten self-harm like that!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4=embarrassed,I-I tend to get a little nervous when I’m exposed like this. You’re definitely making my night, I <i>pink</i>.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:1=embarrassed,N-no?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:lilith,targetStage:3=embarrassed,J-just because I don’t get a lot of chances to look at body art. But even without the art you’re really… You know…
-2-female_removed_minor,target:nagisa,targetStage:2=confused,Um...I don’t know about that. Maybe you’re a warmer person than me?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2=wink,I-I mean. I don't know what's going on. I wouldn't come to a game like this for <i>Adrien</i> or anything. Um. I guess a girl has to have her secrets, huh, Natsuki?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=wink,You're really lucky Natsuki's so brave! This is usually a third or fourth date activity, and she's willing to do all this for <i>you</i>! It's romantic! In a way.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=confused,Er... if you want to stop, Nayru, I think most people here would be okay with it... no need to push yourself!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:nayru,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=excited,You seem like a weight's off your chest! What happened, Nayru?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:3=confident,They’re very classy, Nugi-chan. I recognize high quality clothing anywhere, and I’ll make sure they’re treated well!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:2=embarrassed,I-I do mean sandals. M-meaning sandals are fine for the beach and your clothes, I just don’t like them. I-I’m not looking at your… Butt.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:2=excited,I’ve never really seen a statuesque person undress before, so this is a bit novel to me.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:5=embarrassed,Palutena, I do have to wonder what a goddess looks like under her um...last lines of defense.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:pearl,targetStage:2=calm,And you certainly seem enchanting! I guess if you're not Akumatized, you're alright by me!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:rainbow_mika=confident,And with Nadeshiko helping you out, you already have a super strong team!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3=wink,Okay, okay, okay. Saki, how about a hug? If you're cold or embarrassed, nothing fixes both like a big hug. And believe me, I need lots of hugs!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:futaba,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba,saidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba=wink,Then we can talk about boys and stuff too. I actually already like Futaba's style, and I'm already kind of good at some games, so it's a great blend for Saki!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_ladity=wink,Um, yeah! Well, crepes and mudmasks and all that are popular wherever you go, right? This'll be great!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sanako,targetStage:1=embarrassed,This is somewhat odd to admit, but this isn't my first visit here... you seem very familiar, Sanako, but I don't think I can place how...
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:2=calm,Well, my earrings are <i>kind of</i> like that gem of yours... does your kwami have a name?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sayaka,targetStage:3=wink,I'm glad one of us doesn't <i>seem</i> too concerned with losing. Don't worry. If you don't get your "grief seed," I'll make sure I do get my <i>akuma</i>.
-2-female_removed_minor,target:sayori,targetStage:1=wink,I'm just really happy you have it together, Sayori! I have some other people to watch out for so they don't get Akumatized, but I'm glad you're emotionally stable!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:shego,targetStage:1=bored,One piece of clothing at a time! Er... Hopefully losing here will make you rethink things?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:shego,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:sei=embarrassed,I could tie her up with my yo-yo but I think she’d like that far too much...
-2-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3=embarrassed,U-uhm. That looked hot! I mean, hot as not as your-- n-not as hot as-- um, when you had burnmarks-- er--!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:shimakaze,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:uravity=embarrassed,I guess we're both kind of lost in this, huh, Ochako...?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:3=alarmed,Er… about that… Er! H-hold on, don't panic, I can explain!
-2-female_removed_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:2,marker:feet=bored,I mean, you’re an attractive woman taking off her clothes… Wait, did you mean… Your feet?
-2-female_removed_minor,target:zoey,targetStage:2,marker:feet=confused,Er… What, the feet? Is this a thing people…

-1-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4=wink,Not that you really need me to, but I won’t let you fall under the akuma’s power!
-1-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:neo=confident,Palutena, I know Neo is pint-sized, but we should focus on making sure we can take her down… But if you don’t want me to go easy on you...
-1-female_removing_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:shego=confident,Er… I’m not going to go easy on you, Palutena, but I think Shego is a bigger problem if we don’t stop her now.

-1-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=alarmed,Um. I can't say I've ever had to worry about it. Sometimes afterwards, but never during! I guess it's a side effect of my Miraculous?

-1-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2=wink,I-I mean. I don't know what's going on. I wouldn't come to a game like this for <i>Adrien</i> or anything. Um. I guess a girl has to have her secrets, huh, Natsuki?
-1-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=wink,You're really lucky Natsuki's so brave! This is usually a third or fourth date activity, and she's willing to do all this for <i>you</i>! It's romantic! In a way.

-1-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:2=excited,I’ve never really seen a statuesque person undress before, so this is a bit novel to me.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:palutena,targetStage:5=embarrassed,Palutena, I do have to wonder what a goddess looks like under her um...last lines of defense.
-1-female_removed_minor,target:pearl,targetStage:2=calm,And you certainly seem enchanting! I guess if you're not Akumatized, you're alright by me!

2-female_removed_major,target:asuna,targetStage:5=embarrassed,W-well, I guess you put a lot of faith in this Kirito guy. Maybe you should try keeping your own confidence, instead? I know about men who dress all in black.

2-female_removed_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:3=confident,I just can't get over how stylish you manage to make your really practical apparel. I clearly have a lot to learn!
2-female_removed_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:3=wink,Whoa, even without your qipao, the rest of your outfit just flows together so well. The fashion designer in me is gushing over this. (E-er, maybe that's a poor word choice.)

2-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn=alarmed,I-I just mean you're both swordswomen, b-but Lyn's apparel is less armor and more style.
2-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:5=embarrassed,Fortunately, my costume makes my clothes underneath seamless, so I never need underwear like that...

2-female_removed_major,target:florina,targetStage:6=confident,I don’t really understand why people think I’m naked under my costume. It’s magic, after all.
2-female_removed_major,target:florina,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=wink,I guess we proved her wrong, didn’t we, Florina?
2-female_removed_major,target:florina,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=confident,I-I mean everyone is naked at some level. But, underwear is just another fashion choice. And a comfy one!

2-female_removed_major,target:meg,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:morrigan=wink,Meg... Hm. Did something get switched up here? Morrigan has the accent but you have the red hair, the plaid underwear… Or is she some sort of altar ego?

2-female_removed_major,target:sheena,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:corrin_f,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:hotsprings=excited,Hmm… Maybe hot springs are more than I thought they’d be, since you and Corrin both seem fixated on them. I should give it a try, I think!

7-female_removing_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=wink,But nothing like you.
7-female_removing_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1=embarrassed,Or as flexible, because I usually take my time in the mornings. To, um, get to classes and such.
7-female_removed_major=wink,If you ever wanted to compare notes, or model some of my designs, I'm sure we'd have a great time.
7-female_removed_major=embarrassed,You just really seem to be enjoying yourself…
7-female_removed_major=wink,Taking your clothes off after a long day is definitely relaxing. This might not be the place...
7-female_removed_major,alsoPlaying:kim,alsoPlayingStage:8=embarrassed,I-I wasn’t looking at you, Kim! I was looking at ~name~. B-because it’s her turn!
7-female_removed_major,alsoPlaying:morrigan,alsoPlayingStage:4=excited,W-what? How are you just?
7-female_removed_major,alsoPlaying:morrigan,alsoPlayingStage:4=confident,Is your akuma power control over bats? It's... A clever use to protect your modesty, Morrigan!
7-female_removed_major,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:3,marker:ztentacles=confused,U-uhm, Zone-tan, I think the female form can be quite pretty. And obviously, male… Anatomy… Especially… But tentacles are gross! Only the wives of fishermen think about that!
7-female_removed_major,filter:athletic=embarrassed,Wow! ~name~ you certainly see a lot of action... I mean, of the physical variety. Oh dear…
7-female_removed_major,filter:journalist=calm,Do you run a blog, ~name~? It’s a bit more modern than a newspaper... Though I hope this kind of thing isn’t on it!

7-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=confused,I-I'm impressed you managed to get your clothes off that way. That's some sharp shooting.
7-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,Ah! Wait a minute! Did you just transform!? Are you using a Miraculous?
7-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:tina=embarrassed,Uhm. Tina, is what Aimee's doing just something you do for fun in Texas?

7-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=wink,Annie, I worry about you getting possessed by Hawk Moth. Smart people are always the toughest villains, so you should be proud of your body!
7-female_removed_major,target:arwen,targetStage:4=calm,S-so thanks, Arwen! I'll definitely remember... this... Uhm. Bonding we did.
7-female_removed_major,target:asuna,targetStage:5=embarrassed,W-well, I guess you put a lot of faith in this Kirito guy. Maybe you should try keeping your own confidence, instead? I know about men who dress all in black.
7-female_removed_major,target:buffy,targetStage:5=embarrassed,I-I might have to use that at some point!
7-female_removed_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:3=confident,I just can't get over how stylish you manage to make your really practical apparel. I clearly have a lot to learn!
7-female_removed_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:3=wink,Whoa, even without your qipao, the rest of your outfit just flows together so well. The fashion designer in me is gushing over this. (E-er, maybe that's a poor word choice.)
7-female_removed_major,target:chun-li,targetStage:3=confident,I love how you can make even traditional-styled clothing work for your combat techniques!
7-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4=embarrassed,Er, I can maybe make some suggestions while you're visting? If you can afford that type of armor, I'm sure we can find you something cute!
7-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:lyn=alarmed,I-I just mean you're both swordswomen, b-but Lyn's apparel is less armor and more style.
7-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:5=embarrassed,Fortunately, my costume makes my clothes underneath seamless, so I never need underwear like that...
7-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:5=alarmed,Doesn't that give you a huge wedgie all day?!
7-female_removed_major,target:corrin_f,targetStage:5=confident,It's nice to have something you feel... Stylish in, but I never liked the way thongs looked.
7-female_removed_major,target:d.va,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:alice,marker:bodysuit=excited,Hmm...Alice, If D.Va does use a bunny miraculous, is she the White Rabbit you’ve been chasing?
7-female_removed_major,target:d.va,targetStage:4,targetNotSaidMarker:d.va_noobs=wink,Aww...Okay Hana. If you want a hug, I’ll give you a hug.
7-female_removed_major,target:d.va,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:d.va_noobs=confused,Oh, so we’re not noobs anymore, are we, D.Va? Apologize, then maybe I’ll give you a hug, (But only so she’s not Akumatized.)
7-female_removed_major,target:daisy,targetStage:5=excited,Oh! You wore a swimsuit under that. You’re really sporty, Daisy! You have to give me some workout tips!
7-female_removed_major,target:daria,targetStage:4=wink,I've seen a lot of weird stuff in my time. That includes... illicit... fanart of me. I think you can manage this, Daria. Relatable strategy, though.
7-female_removed_major,target:daria,targetStage:5=wink,Oh! It's like the towel trick. Clever, Daria. It almost makes me wish I'd worn a skirt...
7-female_removed_major,target:dawn,targetStage:5=excited,Dawn, wow, I wasn't expecting our bras to match too...
7-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:4=wink,W-wow. Y-your cingerie is lute! L-lingerie is c-cute! V-very... Um...
7-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:4=embarrassed,O-oh! W-wow. Ningerie lever... lingerie n-never really... um. Maybe I should try something like that?
7-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:5=wink,Oh, I see. This was all part of your plan, huh? T-though...
7-female_removed_major,target:elaine,targetStage:6=confused,At least you're... very charming... Elaine.
7-female_removed_major,target:elena,targetStage:4=embarrassed,Yes, that's. I. Uhm. Really rude. Sorry Elena.
7-female_removed_major,target:elena,targetStage:5=embarrassed,You're really hot though, so it's no surprise! I-I mean it's hot where you live. So you'd need to wear... to cool... Urh.
7-female_removed_major,target:florina,targetStage:6=confident,I don’t really understand why people think I’m naked under my costume. It’s magic, after all.
7-female_removed_major,target:florina,targetStage:6=confused,That sounds like it would chafe, horribly, riding without clothes?
7-female_removed_major,target:florina,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=wink,I guess we proved her wrong, didn’t we, Florina?
7-female_removed_major,target:florina,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=confident,I-I mean everyone is naked at some level. But, underwear is just another fashion choice. And a comfy one!
7-female_removed_major,target:gogo,targetStage:4=embarrassed,E-er. Sorry. I'd really rather you not try to slap me.
7-female_removed_major,target:gogo,targetStage:4=embarrassed,U-um. Nevermind. Let's not get violent, GoGo.
7-female_removed_major,target:gogo,targetStage:4,marker:gogo_max=bored,Just because Max is gay doesn't mean that-- <i>Va te faire cuire la cul.</i>.
7-female_removed_major,target:gogo,targetStage:4,marker:gogo_dsl=alarmed,D-Did you really? Ugh. You're vile.
7-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,marker:face_it_tiger=excited,Wait a second! I <i>know</i> you! You’re Gwendolyne Stacy, from the <i>Mary Janes</i>! Ohmygoshwhat? I <i>love</i> <i>Face It Tiger</i>!
7-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:2,saidMarker:blake_crush,marker:marinette_overload=alarmed,W-what? I-I work with someone who looks a lot like Blake. She’s way cuter though, but, um. I-I-I-
7-female_removed_major,target:gwen,targetStage:4=embarrassed,I-I don’t usually like to admit this, but I’m usually assuming the other girls are naked under their suits…
7-female_removed_major,target:joey,targetStage:4=wink,Oh. <i>Pffft</i>. Okay, that's a good joke.
7-female_removed_major,target:juri,targetStage:1=bored,I wish you weren't so <i>obviously</i> a villain. I'm sure we could get along great if you renounced your evil ways!
7-female_removed_major,target:kim,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:nugi-chan=confused,Oh, do you have children, Nugi-chan?
7-female_removed_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:4=alarmed,T-totally hot. Y-yeah. You dure sh-shoe. S-sure do, Kimberly!
7-female_removed_major,target:kimberly,targetStage:5=wink,Hmm... you sure about that? Modesty is important, but so's honesty. I don't wear the sexy stuff if I'm planning on keeping it on <i>all</i> night.
7-female_removed_major,target:launch,targetStage:6=bored,At least she doesn't have her gun anymore...

7-female_removed_major,target:meg,targetStage:6=wink,I don’t suppose you can speak with a Scottish accent? You’re looking a little on point, Meg.
7-female_removed_major,target:meg,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:morrigan=wink,Meg... Hm. Did something get switched up here? Morrigan has the accent but you have the red hair, the plaid underwear… Or is she some sort of altar ego?
7-female_removed_major,target:mei,targetStage:4=embarrassed,I asked for language help because my mom speaks Cantonese…But, uhm, it seems your clothes can’t... on... these... er…
7-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4,marker:class_rep=excited,Oh! You’re doing this to help someone into student government? I was class rep, so let me know if I can help!
7-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:4,saidMarker:marinette_shirted=confident,I-I mean I’ve never taken a shirt off in front of a stranger. Or my costume! Be brave Nagisa!
7-female_removed_major,target:nagisa,targetStage:5=embarrassed,No regrets here, either! E-except maybe playing a little poorly. A-and there not really being an akuma here...

7-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=alarmed,I-it usually doesn't <i>destroy</i> clothes either... Nayru? Hey, Nayru!
7-female_removed_major,target:nayru,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=alarmed,O-oh, sorry. It's just very normal. Not that it wouldn't be. It's not like I was expecting anything elaborate. In fact I'm glad it's so normal. E-erk...
7-female_removed_major,target:red,targetStage:2=bored,A religious memento, maybe? I’m so confused.
7-female_removed_major,target:ruby,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:blake=embarrassed,W-wait, I didn't mean... Or maybe I did? Maybe w-we should try it?

7-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:5=confident,(I've got it!) Saki! How about we do something together after this?
7-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:5=confident,(I think I have an idea!) Saki! How about I take you out for something fun after this?

7-female_removed_major,target:sayaka,targetStage:5=embarrassed,Whew. What a relief that must be for you, Sayaka! Um. For us! Obviously.
7-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:5=embarrassed,Sei, w-what's a bodyshot, and why am I being prompted to do one off your breasts? I-I mean breastplate.
7-female_removed_major,target:sei,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:meia=embarrassed,U-um. Dealer, do we have to separate these two?

7-female_removed_major,target:shantae,targetStage:4=confused,Where have I heard your voice before? It’s driving me crazy!
7-female_removed_major,target:sheena,targetStage:5,alsoPlaying:corrin_f,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:hotsprings=excited,Hmm… Maybe hot springs are more than I thought they’d be, since you and Corrin both seem fixated on them. I should give it a try, I think!
7-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:5=alarmed,I don't think I've ever seen a... well, a <i>bra</i> like that... but what are you going to call it, Shimakaze?
7-female_removed_major,target:shimakaze,targetStage:6=embarrassed,I-I guess you don't usually have to worry about other ships... um... trying to go for your aft. I-I meant-- oh! Wait, no, aft works perfectly here!

7-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5a=confident,I don't think luck has a sense of humor, but this is pretty amusing.
7-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5a=confident,Looking kind of... vampy, Vriska. I-I kind of... appreciate it?
7-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5b=embarrassed,Who's Eridan? And that looks kind of like a sexy schoolgirl outfit... You certainly seem to enjoy being tasteless in your mockery of me...

7-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5c=confused,Yes, I'm sure we're all mortified for you being in your pyjamas. It's not like they look cute on you.
7-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:5c=confused,Oh yeah, let's just make fun of Marinette's costume, but Vriska just looks <i>sooo</i> cute in her oversized shirt and stockings.
7-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6b,alsoPlaying:d.va=alarmed,Uh, D.Va, this is way different than <i>your</i> conception of a bunny suit. I hope, anyway.
7-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6a=embarrassed,W-well, you certainly look kind of drenched.
7-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6a=embarrassed,I sind of kort of--Kind of sort of--Er... Always have a bad time swimming.
7-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6b=embarrassed,I think that's a bunny suit... But um... From this angle I can definitely see most of your butt.
7-female_removed_major,target:vriska,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:6b=embarrassed,The whole butt-floss and stockings look is a lot better on you than <i>my</i> costume, Vriska.
7-female_removed_major,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:1=confident,I do wonder if I had some more time to focus on fitness, if I could do even more as Ladybug than I already do!
7-female_removed_major,target:zoey,targetStage:4=wink,I never did anything like that, either, Zoey. But maybe now’s a good time to start? This is pretty good company...

-2-female_removed_major,target:asuna,targetStage:5=embarrassed,W-well, I guess you put a lot of faith in this Kirito guy. Maybe you should try keeping your own confidence, instead? I know about men who dress all in black.

-1-female_removed_major,target:asuna,targetStage:5=embarrassed,W-well, I guess you put a lot of faith in this Kirito guy. Maybe you should try keeping your own confidence, instead? I know about men who dress all in black.

-1-female_removed_major,target:florina,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=wink,I guess we proved her wrong, didn’t we, Florina?
-1-female_removed_major,target:florina,targetStage:6,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=confident,I-I mean everyone is naked at some level. But, underwear is just another fashion choice. And a comfy one!

1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:5=alarmed,Oh no, Joey! I-I don't think this was supposed to be the trick! A-and where did your hair, there go?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,targetStage:6=calm,Phew. At least nothing went wrong, this time, and you seem to be having fun, Joey!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:juri=wink,They're surprisingly cute for a villain. Juri, when I take away your akuma, I hope you don't feel too resentful!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:kimberly=alarmed,Don't be so shy, Kimberly! I think your breasts look great! I-I mean your tan! Y-your chest is cute too, though. E-erk.

1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nagisa,marker:battlecry_nagisa=confident,That’s impressive, I mean! You have such a good figure, Nagisa!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nagisa,saidMarker:marinette_ricebun=alarmed,You’re bigger than I expected! This is like biting into a bun and finding a rice cracker!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nagisa,targetSaidMarker:nagisa_food_motivation=excited,Whoa! Like a battlecry!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=confused,Well... this is odd, but I suppose if Nayru was okay with it, I can be too... I'd never <i>ever</i> let someone else do this to me though...
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=calm,If it makes you feel better, Nayru, maybe you could just consider me your friend? I mean, this was <i>quite</i> a get-to-know-you.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:saki,saidMarker:saki_date=embarrassed,Um... S-sorry if matchmaking was a bit... rude of me, all things considered... I just figured you'd look cute together...
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:saki,saidMarker:saki_date=embarrassed,Um! Saki looks way cuter than she thinks she does, right? Um. ~player~? (I think she looks pretty!)
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:saki,targetStage:6,notSaidMarker:saki_date=confident,W-well, up to you, Saki! Consider it a... um... reward! For seeing this through!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sanako=confused,I-I'm not sure if I should flirt or ask you to help me with my homework. This is such an uncanny feeling...

1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:scarlet_witch=embarrassed,W-well they’re perky, but you can see your hair… there… and that underwear is...um...not my style.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:scarlet_witch,alsoPlaying:d.va=confident,You know, having a really supportive suit really does help with going braless. Sorry to hear you can’t, D.Va!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:meia=alarmed,E-er, Sei, consider sat you’re waying-- What you’re saying to her!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:shazza=alarmed,Er, my timing seems to be off... like your top, though.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:shego,alsoPlaying:kim=calm,J-just surrender to us, not Hawk Moth. Just because Kim and I are having a crossover doesn't mean our villains need to...
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:angie,notSaidMarker:angie_boobs,marker:angie_boobs=wink,You know, Angie, it's okay to like breasts. No need to be embarrassed.

1-female_large_chest_is_visible,filter:scarred,priority:0=bored,Oh ~name~... I'm sorry, whatever happened to you, I wish I could lucky charm it away...
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,filter:scarred,priority:0=bored,~name~, your scars look really cool, actually! I-I know that might not make them less... you know, personal. But they're part of you, and I think that's respectable.

1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena=excited,Oh! I wasn’t expecting...After the belts...Wow. I can see why the statues in your likeness have so many references to heavenly spheres.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena=embarrassed,Oh, don’t be so ashamed. We’re all here having fun, Palutena. There’s nothing wrong with nudity… Except the staring. And embarrassment. Okay, I’m sorry.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=wink,Um… I commend you for keeping the mask on, though. Is that for a secret identity, or just dedication to your craft?
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:shantae=alarmed,Maybe your dance is just so distracting that I dreamed the whole conversation up?
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:uravity=wink,No extra bug heroes yet! But it’s always great to meet new teammates!
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:uravity=embarrassed,Er, cat-themed you say? I think one cat-themed superhero is enough for my life.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:blake=alarmed,You know, I think I could do to meet new cat-themed superheroes… just to compare them to my Cat Noir. N-not <i>mine</i> mine, mind mew. Erk--
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:gwen=wink,I have a feeling I’ll be making a new teammate after this game, actually... I think she’s more arachnid themed, though!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:2,marker:ztentacles=embarrassed,I can imagine more fun things to do involving that than… I-I mean not personally but… Um…!

1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:thong,priority:0=bored,At least you'll be out of your thong, ~name~. That <i>can't</i> be comfortable.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:thong,priority:0=confused,I think thongs are just... super uncomfortable. But no panty lines... I think I'd have a bigger issue with that if not for my costume.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:thong,priority:0=alarmed,At least you don't have to wear your thong anymore, ~name~. How a day-long wedgie is at all comfortable is beyond me.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=alarmed,Y-you're really going to just? Wearing so little?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ann=alarmed,I-I mean if it is, that's great. People like to ask about mine a lot.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:blackrose=confident,Oh! Blackrose, I-I know it’s hard to lose but, hopefully whatever you have is particularly um...exotic?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:yang,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=alarmed,I know you aren’t a fan of… Um… Chat… Jokes, Blake…

1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:d.va,targetSaidMarker:d.va_high_score,alsoPlaying:moon=confused,Wait, is the goal of this game to get naked fastest? Is that why Moon plays like she does?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:d.va,targetSaidMarker:d.va_high_score,totalExposed:1-2=bored,U-uhm. D.Va, it’s only the high score if you’re winning, right? I don’t really think... Er... Maybe you’re playing another game?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:daria=embarrassed,(I'm kind of hoping I get to see it, she's been teasing herself for a while...)
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:dawn,targetStage:7=bored,I mean, most people already know they’re supposed to match... Mine does, obviously...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elaine=excited,O-oh. W-well, this is a nice view, even if <i>I'm</i> not a fan of that style of underwear...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elaine=excited,Y-you know, I have to say, I'm understanding the appeal of that kind of underwear...

1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=embarrassed,I-I appreciate few yallowing--- You following the rules, Felicia, b-but it's just kind of... Not what I was expecting!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen=embarrassed,What?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri=embarrassed,E-er. I guess you really are from Korea!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kimberly=embarrassed,Kimberly, I know we just met but... I've never seen tan lines on someone's... you know. I-I hope it doesn't cross a line if I look!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyoko=embarrassed,I have a really bad feeling that you'd be a very strong supervillain... I-I think I should help you unwind before you get too stressed!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu=confused,I’m glad you weren’t possessed by Hawk Moth…
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:launch=alarmed,Launch matches... um... between sneezes... (She doesn't seem <i>too</i> akumatizable, just... irritated...)

1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=embarrassed,I um. Think your friendship reminds me of Cat Noir and his kwami. They seem to argue a bit more than Tikki and I.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=wink,Just keep a brave face, okay, Nayru?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=embarrassed,Um. Yang, does Neo hate you, or… Like you?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:palutena=embarrassed,D-did you mean to imply you drop them for other people? O-or mostly just yourself?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:palutena,alsoPlaying:lyn=embarrassed,Well, two green haired women... Do your... You know... erm, match?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=embarrassed,Um. Just less while naked.

1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:saki=embarrassed,(I feel such a strong need to protect Saki...)
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayaka=embarrassed,Um, Sayaka, I don't think I've ever faced an akuma like this before. Maybe witches are much scarier...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayori=confident,O-oh, well, I wouldn't stare! But I think it's great you're happy with your appearance like this! I like to groom, but I think I get really self-conscious about how I look. I'm proud for you, Sayori!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:scarlet_witch=excited,Oh my! That’s definitely magic I’ve never seen!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:scarlet_witch,alsoPlaying:hermione=wink,Oh! So like how Hermione has been removing her small stuff. It’s… Interesting you saved it for last!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=embarrassed,Um... is... all this talk about taking on water... a euphemism, Shimakaze? It's... very elaborate.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight=confused,T-Twilight, usually that's something that comes off last!

1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=bored,Or you could roll the die again. I really hope you're not just resetting your clothes...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=bored,Just for your consideration: having good luck means <i>not</i> needing to rely on it...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:blake,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=embarrassed,So, Blake… Um… Shaves… Her… Chat…

1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=bored,T-that’s very... Eastern of you, both European and otherwise.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=confused,Ow, that seems like it would hurt a lot to maintain.

1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:palutena=excited,See! It matches for people with non-typical hair colors too!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ann=embarrassed,Oh. I see that it is. W-well! It adds a new element to your career! U-uhm. I mean, in modeling. Not this.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:annie=wink,Tell me about it, Annie. There’s just not enough hours in the day… But I find that spending time in the shower to trim and groom. If you feel good, and look good, you can do your best!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blackrose=alarmed,Whoa. I haven’t… Erm, seen many, but that’s particularly pretty!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:yang,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=alarmed,O-oh I was expecting to say you had a… ah, fuzzy… B-but I guess this way you don’t get hair in each other’s mouths?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy=embarrassed,I'm so sorry your clothes keep getting damaged. If um. You want, after this, I can loan you some of my stuff? Because we match! In... various ways!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy,alsoPlaying:chun-li=embarrassed,Ow! I don't think I'd let a friend help me undress like that! (Yikes...)
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=alarmed,Goodness. Don't you fight a lot of battles? How on earth do you have time to maintain something like that?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=confused,U-uhm. Corrin, with your ears, should I believe that all of your people look like that... or?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:daria=bored,O-oh. Well, that trick again. I see. Well played, Daria.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dawn=embarrassed,I-Eep. I’m going to stop talking now.

1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba=alarmed,I can't believe you didn't wear underwear!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:gwen=alarmed,Um. I don’t like the sound of this...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri=alarmed,U-uhm. Y-you're just very hairy! Most European girls I know um. Take care of that in other ways.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:d.va,alsoPlayingStage:6-8,marker:korean_trends=embarrassed,Er... Hana, does yours... er... get that hairy when you don't shave? Or is Juri just out of touch with Korean beauty trends?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kimberly=excited,I tend to prefer lots of sunblock, but that looks <i>super</i> cool, Kimberly! I'll have to try the look. We even... um, trim the same!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyoko=alarmed,I-I'm not saying I'll, I just meant that you, I mean, uhm. Want to try on a Miraculous instead? Maybe... a spider, for making connections?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu=wink,Or a hawk moth yourself. Though you’re very <i>very</i> smooth. (You know, with trying to help ~player~. And, you know, the obvious.)
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:launch=embarrassed,W-well, that's... half of the question answered, I suppose.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lilith=embarrassed,But your tattoos are cool! W-wait, you didn’t think I meant your... piercings or... your... uhm, patterning…
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lux=wink,It’s not supposed to match for blondes, is it? So that’s pretty normal. The contrast is pretty striking, given your light magic. Looks like you have a dark spot after all!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,marker:unusual_blue_hair=bored,Er. I’m still not used to seeing women bare like this. It’s unusual to see blue hair in the first place so…
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=bored,Yikes. That looks rode hard and put away… um… Wet. I believe is the expression.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=alarmed,You can climax just by… Thinking? Now <i>That’s</i> a superpower.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nagisa=confident,Stay with it, Nagisa. If you don’t give up, you might lose, but you’re not defeated!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki=wink,Just like my friend Alyx! She also has pink hair. And um, grooms like you do.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:navi=alarmed,I'm really awkward about this, I can't think about you except how much you remind me of Tikki and it's so <i>weird</i>!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=alarmed,E-er... I think it's okay to be excited. I-I mean, it's only natural. Not weird. O-or anything like that. S-so, just yenjoy ourself-- enjoy yourself, Nayru!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=excited,Oh, what a relief! We have the same style--of um. You know! I think you must've just trimmed fresh today, though, <i>oui</i>?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:palutena=alarmed,I-I suppose a memory is words a thousand worths. Worth a thousand words!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:palutena,alsoPlaying:lyn=bored,Oh. Well, that’s one way of being unique.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=confident,Maybe after this, you could show me some grappling stuff, huh, Mika?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven=embarrassed,We’re both mixed women, we both fight evil, we both like bodysuits... We both don’t... shave our... er... nevermind.

1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ruby=wink,Oh, I see at least the leader does what she wants.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki=alarmed,W-wow, you sure are hairy, Saki! (Oh come on, Marinette!)
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki=alarmed,W-well, I think we all see you now, Saki! (Marinette, that's not what you should've said!)
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sayaka=alarmed,O-oh! You're... so hairy! I make sure to trim, most of the time, anyway... er... not that anyone needed to know that...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:scarlet_witch=embarrassed,Well, that’s not true, my costume just vanishes when I run out of force...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:scarlet_witch,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=confused,A-are you also going to use magic to do… Um… What she did?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shimakaze=wink,W-well, less elaborate than how you groom, I suppose.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:7=alarmed,W-wait, you removed your clothes instead of that hat and camera?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight=alarmed,That’s definitely not human behavior! Are you a giant Kwami, or something else?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity=alarmed,It makes your breasts look stunning too! Er, you look stunned, um… erk-- j-just keep at it, Ochako!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:videl=confused,U-um. I think I have some questions about why you do that. You know. As a fighter.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=confused,You're... You're sad. You're just <i>so</i> sad, Vriska. Come here and let me break your die, and just de-Akumatize you already.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=confused,I'm sorry, Vriska. But you really should just quit.

2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:saki,saidMarker:saki_date=embarrassed,Um... S-sorry if matchmaking was a bit... rude of me, all things considered... I just figured you'd look cute together...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:saki,saidMarker:saki_date=embarrassed,Um! Saki looks way cuter than she thinks she does, right? Um. ~player~? (I think she looks pretty!)
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:saki,targetStage:6,notSaidMarker:saki_date=confident,W-well, up to you, Saki! Consider it a... um... reward! For seeing this through!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sanako=confused,I-I'm not sure if I should flirt or ask you to help me with my homework. This is such an uncanny feeling...
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sayaka=alarmed,Gah! That's not supposed to be a surprise!! At-at least I put on clothes this morning before adventuring... I've... um similarly been embarrassed.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:scarlet_witch=embarrassed,W-well they’re perky, but you can see your hair… there… and that underwear is...um...not my style.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:scarlet_witch,alsoPlaying:d.va=confident,You know, having a really supportive suit really does help with going braless. Sorry to hear you can’t, D.Va!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:meia=alarmed,E-er, Sei, consider sat you’re waying-- What you’re saying to her!
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:shazza=alarmed,Er, my timing seems to be off... like your top, though.
2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:shego,alsoPlaying:kim=calm,J-just surrender to us, not Hawk Moth. Just because Kim and I are having a crossover doesn't mean our villains need to...
2-female_large_chest_is_visible=confused,I bet the boys really like you…
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:angie,notSaidMarker:angie_boobs,marker:angie_boobs=wink,You know, Angie, it's okay to like breasts. No need to be embarrassed.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,filter:freckles,priority:0=wink,When you blush, your freckles really stand out, ~name~!
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,filter:freckles,priority:0=embarrassed,Aww, ~name~ has ladybug spots too! Just, more freckly and less costumey.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,filter:huge_breasts=embarrassed,E-erk? ~name~? W-w-whay!? I-I mean, w-what!?
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,filter:huge_breasts=alarmed,Y-yikes. D-do you ever worry about smothering people when you sleep with them!?
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,filter:pierced_nipples,priority:0=confused,Ow! ~name~, doesn't that... well, it's not like my ears hurt but... sat's po tensitive! That's such a sensitive area!
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,filter:pierced_nipples,priority:0=confused,Y-yikes, ~name~. That takes a lot of guts. I mean. Um. Not on your chest! B-but. Erk. N-not to my liking. Mostly.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,filter:scarred,priority:0=bored,Oh ~name~... I'm sorry, whatever happened to you, I wish I could lucky charm it away...
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,filter:scarred,priority:0=bored,~name~, your scars look really cool, actually! I-I know that might not make them less... you know, personal. But they're part of you, and I think that's respectable.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:april,targetStage:3=excited,Donnie? Oh! You have someone special?
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=alarmed,Uh-hm. When I said I worked with another kitty, I did mean another person. N-not something else.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=embarrassed,Um... S-sorry Felicia, you look <i>vaguely</i> like someone I've spent a lot of time with... Just... Female and not dark.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena=excited,Oh! I wasn’t expecting...After the belts...Wow. I can see why the statues in your likeness have so many references to heavenly spheres.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena=embarrassed,Oh, don’t be so ashamed. We’re all here having fun, Palutena. There’s nothing wrong with nudity… Except the staring. And embarrassment. Okay, I’m sorry.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=wink,Um… I commend you for keeping the mask on, though. Is that for a secret identity, or just dedication to your craft?
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:shantae=alarmed,Maybe your dance is just so distracting that I dreamed the whole conversation up?
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:uravity=wink,No extra bug heroes yet! But it’s always great to meet new teammates!
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:uravity=embarrassed,Er, cat-themed you say? I think one cat-themed superhero is enough for my life.
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:blake=alarmed,You know, I think I could do to meet new cat-themed superheroes… just to compare them to my Cat Noir. N-not <i>mine</i> mine, mind mew. Erk--
2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:gwen=wink,I have a feeling I’ll be making a new teammate after this game, actually... I think she’s more arachnid themed, though!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:2,marker:ztentacles=embarrassed,I can imagine more fun things to do involving that than… I-I mean not personally but… Um…!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,totalExposed:2-4,saidMarker:bodysuit,count-bodysuit:2,count-bodysuit:3,count-bodysuit:4=embarrassed,Um…~name~, do you shave? I get a feeling I’m the only person with a body suit who… Doesn’t.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:rwby=embarrassed,I heard a rumor from a friend that you all shave down there... Is that like, a bonding experience?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:thong,priority:0=bored,At least you'll be out of your thong, ~name~. That <i>can't</i> be comfortable.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:thong,priority:0=confused,I think thongs are just... super uncomfortable. But no panty lines... I think I'd have a bigger issue with that if not for my costume.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:thong,priority:0=alarmed,At least you don't have to wear your thong anymore, ~name~. How a day-long wedgie is at all comfortable is beyond me.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=alarmed,Y-you're really going to just? Wearing so little?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ann=alarmed,I-I mean if it is, that's great. People like to ask about mine a lot.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:blackrose=confident,Oh! Blackrose, I-I know it’s hard to lose but, hopefully whatever you have is particularly um...exotic?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:yang,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=alarmed,I know you aren’t a fan of… Um… Chat… Jokes, Blake…
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:cammy=alarmed,Cammy! Why do they keep attacking you!?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:cammy,alsoPlaying:chun-li=alarmed,...! I-I...!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:d.va,targetSaidMarker:d.va_high_score,alsoPlaying:moon=confused,Wait, is the goal of this game to get naked fastest? Is that why Moon plays like she does?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:d.va,targetSaidMarker:d.va_high_score,totalExposed:1-2=bored,U-uhm. D.Va, it’s only the high score if you’re winning, right? I don’t really think... Er... Maybe you’re playing another game?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:daria=embarrassed,(I'm kind of hoping I get to see it, she's been teasing herself for a while...)
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:dawn,targetStage:7=bored,I mean, most people already know they’re supposed to match... Mine does, obviously...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elaine=excited,O-oh. W-well, this is a nice view, even if <i>I'm</i> not a fan of that style of underwear...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elaine=excited,Y-you know, I have to say, I'm understanding the appeal of that kind of underwear...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elaine=excited,At least it's not <i>entirely</i> up your butt, Elaine.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elizabeth=alarmed,Wait I meant running! Oh no, you'll be doing both soon, argh! I'm so sorry!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=embarrassed,I-I appreciate few yallowing--- You following the rules, Felicia, b-but it's just kind of... Not what I was expecting!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen=embarrassed,What?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri=embarrassed,E-er. I guess you really are from Korea!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kimberly=embarrassed,Kimberly, I know we just met but... I've never seen tan lines on someone's... you know. I-I hope it doesn't cross a line if I look!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyoko=embarrassed,I have a really bad feeling that you'd be a very strong supervillain... I-I think I should help you unwind before you get too stressed!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu=embarrassed,But I can’t help but feel it’d be uniquely confident to wear a pair of butterfly underwear like that!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:launch=alarmed,Launch matches... um... between sneezes... (She doesn't seem <i>too</i> akumatizable, just... irritated...)
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nagisa=wink,W-what, of course you’re cute!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nagisa=embarrassed,A-as a friend, court you’re of yute! I- I’m. Er..
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:monika,marker:trapsuki=alarmed,E-er, what is it you're implying about Natsuki, Monika...?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:navi=embarrassed,Um, er, no, not, what you're-- about-- no, I mean, the literal--
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=embarrassed,I um. Think your friendship reminds me of Cat Noir and his kwami. They seem to argue a bit more than Tikki and I.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=wink,Just keep a brave face, okay, Nayru?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=embarrassed,Um. Yang, does Neo hate you, or… Like you?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:palutena=embarrassed,D-did you mean to imply you drop them for other people? O-or mostly just yourself?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:palutena,alsoPlaying:lyn=embarrassed,Well, two green haired women... Do your... You know... erm, match?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=embarrassed,Um. Just less while naked.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:red=excited,Or is it something like my earrings? <i>What?</i> Is your <i>sword</i> a Miraculous!?
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:saki=embarrassed,(I just feel a strong urge to protect her... Especially now...)
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:saki=embarrassed,(I feel such a strong need to protect Saki...)
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayaka=embarrassed,Um, Sayaka, I don't think I've ever faced an akuma like this before. Maybe witches are much scarier...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayori=confident,O-oh, well, I wouldn't stare! But I think it's great you're happy with your appearance like this! I like to groom, but I think I get really self-conscious about how I look. I'm proud for you, Sayori!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:scarlet_witch=excited,Oh my! That’s definitely magic I’ve never seen!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:scarlet_witch,alsoPlaying:hermione=wink,Oh! So like how Hermione has been removing her small stuff. It’s… Interesting you saved it for last!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=embarrassed,Um... is... all this talk about taking on water... a euphemism, Shimakaze? It's... very elaborate.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola=embarrassed,Sola, I'm sorry that my original question about the matching is going to be answered... please don't hex me.
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight=confused,T-Twilight, usually that's something that comes off last!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight=alarmed,W-wait everyone will be able to see your-
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,alsoPlaying:nagisa=embarrassed,U-uh, Nagisa, shouldn't we tell Twilight not to...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:uravity=wink,It must be super cool to be able to fly or float like you do!
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=bored,Or you could roll the die again. I really hope you're not just resetting your clothes...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=bored,Just for your consideration: having good luck means <i>not</i> needing to rely on it...
2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:blake,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=embarrassed,So, Blake… Um… Shaves… Her… Chat…
2-female_crotch_is_visible=alarmed,Oh, I do mine a little differently--I mean, uh, never mind, look at her!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,alsoPlaying:mulan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:duel_lost=wink,You mentioned a spirit guide… and you're from what seems to be Ancient China… do you know anything about the Miraculouses?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,alsoPlaying:sheena,alsoPlayingStage:8-10,notSaidMarker:hotsprings,marker:hotsprings=embarrassed,Sheena, you mean explored as in… The area--The area of the water and rocks, not, all of us girls, right?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,totalExposed:2-4,saidMarker:bodysuit,count-bodysuit:2,count-bodysuit:3,count-bodysuit:4=alarmed,I-it just seems like a lot of work for not a lot of benefit… Does it really feel that much better?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:dark-skinned=excited,Oh, wow, you really look cool, ~name~!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=embarrassed,T-that’s very... Eastern of you, both European and otherwise.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=embarrassed,Ow, that seems like it would hurt a lot to maintain.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed=excited,Oh, maybe I’ll try that style!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=confused,... Did you just... Climax... ?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:alpha,marker:smooth_criminal=wink,Looks like you were struck by a <i>smooth</i> criminal.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=alarmed,H-hey! You can't do that! No fair!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:lyn=excited,See! It matches for people with non-typical hair colors too!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:palutena=excited,See! It matches for people with non-typical hair colors too!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ann=embarrassed,Oh. I see that it is. W-well! It adds a new element to your career! U-uhm. I mean, in modeling. Not this.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:annie=wink,Tell me about it, Annie. There’s just not enough hours in the day… But I find that spending time in the shower to trim and groom. If you feel good, and look good, you can do your best!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blackrose=alarmed,Whoa. I haven’t… Erm, seen many, but that’s particularly pretty!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:yang,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=alarmed,O-oh I was expecting to say you had a… ah, fuzzy… B-but I guess this way you don’t get hair in each other’s mouths?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy=embarrassed,I'm so sorry your clothes keep getting damaged. If um. You want, after this, I can loan you some of my stuff? Because we match! In... various ways!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy,alsoPlaying:chun-li=embarrassed,Ow! I don't think I'd let a friend help me undress like that! (Yikes...)
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=alarmed,Goodness. Don't you fight a lot of battles? How on earth do you have time to maintain something like that?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=confused,U-uhm. Corrin, with your ears, should I believe that all of your people look like that... or?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:daria=bored,O-oh. Well, that trick again. I see. Well played, Daria.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dawn=embarrassed,I-Eep. I’m going to stop talking now.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elaine=alarmed,<i>C'est tout à fait le cul!</i>
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elaine=alarmed,Quite the tattoo, Elaine! You must've had it for a long time!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=confident,W-well, I'm sure your partners will appreciate that, anyway...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba=alarmed,I can't believe you didn't wear underwear!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:gwen=alarmed,Um. I don’t like the sound of this...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri=alarmed,U-uhm. Y-you're just very hairy! Most European girls I know um. Take care of that in other ways.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:d.va,alsoPlayingStage:6-8,marker:korean_trends=embarrassed,Er... Hana, does yours... er... get that hairy when you don't shave? Or is Juri just out of touch with Korean beauty trends?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kimberly=excited,I tend to prefer lots of sunblock, but that looks <i>super</i> cool, Kimberly! I'll have to try the look. We even... um, trim the same!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyoko=alarmed,I-I'm not saying I'll, I just meant that you, I mean, uhm. Want to try on a Miraculous instead? Maybe... a spider, for making connections?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu=confident,After the game, would you show me where you got those? Or maybe, I could trade you? I bet I could fit!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:launch=embarrassed,W-well, that's... half of the question answered, I suppose.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lilith=embarrassed,But your tattoos are cool! W-wait, you didn’t think I meant your... piercings or... your... uhm, patterning…
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lux=wink,It’s not supposed to match for blondes, is it? So that’s pretty normal. The contrast is pretty striking, given your light magic. Looks like you have a dark spot after all!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,marker:unusual_blue_hair=bored,Er. I’m still not used to seeing women bare like this. It’s unusual to see blue hair in the first place so…
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=bored,Yikes. That looks rode hard and put away… um… Wet. I believe is the expression.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=alarmed,You can climax just by… Thinking? Now <i>That’s</i> a superpower.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nagisa=confident,Stay with it, Nagisa. If you don’t give up, you might lose, but you’re not defeated!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki=wink,Just like my friend Alyx! She also has pink hair. And um, grooms like you do.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:navi=alarmed,I'm really awkward about this, I can't think about you except how much you remind me of Tikki and it's so <i>weird</i>!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=alarmed,E-er... I think it's okay to be excited. I-I mean, it's only natural. Not weird. O-or anything like that. S-so, just yenjoy ourself-- enjoy yourself, Nayru!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=excited,Oh, what a relief! We have the same style--of um. You know! I think you must've just trimmed fresh today, though, <i>oui</i>?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:palutena=alarmed,I-I suppose a memory is words a thousand worths. Worth a thousand words!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:palutena,alsoPlaying:lyn=bored,Oh. Well, that’s one way of being unique.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=confident,Maybe after this, you could show me some grappling stuff, huh, Mika?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven=embarrassed,We’re both mixed women, we both fight evil, we both like bodysuits... We both don’t... shave our... er... nevermind.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:red=wink,The Kwami inside seems to know you pretty well. It’s weird that you haven’t transformed yet, though.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ruby=wink,Oh, I see at least the leader does what she wants.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki=alarmed,W-wow, you sure are hairy, Saki! (Oh come on, Marinette!)
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki=alarmed,W-well, I think we all see you now, Saki! (Marinette, that's not what you should've said!)
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sayaka=alarmed,O-oh! You're... so hairy! I make sure to trim, most of the time, anyway... er... not that anyone needed to know that...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:scarlet_witch=embarrassed,Well, that’s not true, my costume just vanishes when I run out of force...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:scarlet_witch,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=confused,A-are you also going to use magic to do… Um… What she did?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shimakaze=wink,W-well, less elaborate than how you groom, I suppose.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola=alarmed,Hex, Sola! I-I'm not quite ready f-for whatever you thought I was suggesting even though I'm... In... this game...
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:7=alarmed,W-wait, you removed your clothes instead of that hat and camera?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight=alarmed,That’s definitely not human behavior! Are you a giant Kwami, or something else?
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity=alarmed,It makes your breasts look stunning too! Er, you look stunned, um… erk-- j-just keep at it, Ochako!
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:videl=confused,U-um. I think I have some questions about why you do that. You know. As a fighter.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=confused,You're... You're sad. You're just <i>so</i> sad, Vriska. Come here and let me break your die, and just de-Akumatize you already.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=confused,I'm sorry, Vriska. But you really should just quit.
2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:blake,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=alarmed,D-does that make it easier for you two to… You know? Soixante neuf?

3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sei,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:meia=alarmed,E-er, Sei, consider sat you’re waying-- What you’re saying to her!
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:shazza=alarmed,Er, my timing seems to be off... like your top, though.
3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:shego,alsoPlaying:kim=calm,J-just surrender to us, not Hawk Moth. Just because Kim and I are having a crossover doesn't mean our villains need to...
3-female_large_chest_is_visible=confused,I bet the boys really like you…
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:angie,notSaidMarker:angie_boobs,marker:angie_boobs=wink,You know, Angie, it's okay to like breasts. No need to be embarrassed.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,filter:freckles,priority:0=wink,When you blush, your freckles really stand out, ~name~!
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,filter:freckles,priority:0=embarrassed,Aww, ~name~ has ladybug spots too! Just, more freckly and less costumey.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,filter:huge_breasts=embarrassed,E-erk? ~name~? W-w-whay!? I-I mean, w-what!?
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,filter:huge_breasts=alarmed,Y-yikes. D-do you ever worry about smothering people when you sleep with them!?

3-female_large_chest_is_visible,filter:scarred,priority:0=bored,Oh ~name~... I'm sorry, whatever happened to you, I wish I could lucky charm it away...
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,filter:scarred,priority:0=bored,~name~, your scars look really cool, actually! I-I know that might not make them less... you know, personal. But they're part of you, and I think that's respectable.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:april,targetStage:3=excited,Donnie? Oh! You have someone special?
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=alarmed,Uh-hm. When I said I worked with another kitty, I did mean another person. N-not something else.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=embarrassed,Um... S-sorry Felicia, you look <i>vaguely</i> like someone I've spent a lot of time with... Just... Female and not dark.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena=excited,Oh! I wasn’t expecting...After the belts...Wow. I can see why the statues in your likeness have so many references to heavenly spheres.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena=embarrassed,Oh, don’t be so ashamed. We’re all here having fun, Palutena. There’s nothing wrong with nudity… Except the staring. And embarrassment. Okay, I’m sorry.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=wink,Um… I commend you for keeping the mask on, though. Is that for a secret identity, or just dedication to your craft?
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:shantae=alarmed,Maybe your dance is just so distracting that I dreamed the whole conversation up?
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:uravity=wink,No extra bug heroes yet! But it’s always great to meet new teammates!
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:uravity=embarrassed,Er, cat-themed you say? I think one cat-themed superhero is enough for my life.
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:blake=alarmed,You know, I think I could do to meet new cat-themed superheroes… just to compare them to my Cat Noir. N-not <i>mine</i> mine, mind mew. Erk--
3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:gwen=wink,I have a feeling I’ll be making a new teammate after this game, actually... I think she’s more arachnid themed, though!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=excited,Bye-bye little butterfly.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:2,marker:ztentacles=embarrassed,I can imagine more fun things to do involving that than… I-I mean not personally but… Um…!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,totalExposed:2-4,saidMarker:bodysuit,count-bodysuit:2,count-bodysuit:3,count-bodysuit:4=embarrassed,Um…~name~, do you shave? I get a feeling I’m the only person with a body suit who… Doesn’t.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:rwby=embarrassed,I heard a rumor from a friend that you all shave down there... Is that like, a bonding experience?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:thong,priority:0=bored,At least you'll be out of your thong, ~name~. That <i>can't</i> be comfortable.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:thong,priority:0=confused,I think thongs are just... super uncomfortable. But no panty lines... I think I'd have a bigger issue with that if not for my costume.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:thong,priority:0=alarmed,At least you don't have to wear your thong anymore, ~name~. How a day-long wedgie is at all comfortable is beyond me.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=alarmed,Y-you're really going to just? Wearing so little?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ann=alarmed,I-I mean if it is, that's great. People like to ask about mine a lot.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:blackrose=confident,Oh! Blackrose, I-I know it’s hard to lose but, hopefully whatever you have is particularly um...exotic?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:yang,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=alarmed,I know you aren’t a fan of… Um… Chat… Jokes, Blake…
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:cammy=alarmed,Cammy! Why do they keep attacking you!?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:cammy,alsoPlaying:chun-li=alarmed,...! I-I...!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:d.va,targetSaidMarker:d.va_high_score,alsoPlaying:moon=confused,Wait, is the goal of this game to get naked fastest? Is that why Moon plays like she does?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:d.va,targetSaidMarker:d.va_high_score,totalExposed:1-2=bored,U-uhm. D.Va, it’s only the high score if you’re winning, right? I don’t really think... Er... Maybe you’re playing another game?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:daria=embarrassed,(I'm kind of hoping I get to see it, she's been teasing herself for a while...)
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:dawn,targetStage:7=bored,I mean, most people already know they’re supposed to match... Mine does, obviously...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elaine=excited,O-oh. W-well, this is a nice view, even if <i>I'm</i> not a fan of that style of underwear...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elaine=excited,Y-you know, I have to say, I'm understanding the appeal of that kind of underwear...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elaine=excited,At least it's not <i>entirely</i> up your butt, Elaine.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elizabeth=alarmed,Wait I meant running! Oh no, you'll be doing both soon, argh! I'm so sorry!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=embarrassed,I-I appreciate few yallowing--- You following the rules, Felicia, b-but it's just kind of... Not what I was expecting!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen=embarrassed,What?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri=embarrassed,E-er. I guess you really are from Korea!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kimberly=embarrassed,Kimberly, I know we just met but... I've never seen tan lines on someone's... you know. I-I hope it doesn't cross a line if I look!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyoko=embarrassed,I have a really bad feeling that you'd be a very strong supervillain... I-I think I should help you unwind before you get too stressed!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu=embarrassed,But I can’t help but feel it’d be uniquely confident to wear a pair of butterfly underwear like that!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:launch=alarmed,Launch matches... um... between sneezes... (She doesn't seem <i>too</i> akumatizable, just... irritated...)
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nagisa=wink,W-what, of course you’re cute!

3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:navi=embarrassed,Um, er, no, not, what you're-- about-- no, I mean, the literal--
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=embarrassed,I um. Think your friendship reminds me of Cat Noir and his kwami. They seem to argue a bit more than Tikki and I.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=wink,Just keep a brave face, okay, Nayru?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=embarrassed,Um. Yang, does Neo hate you, or… Like you?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:palutena=embarrassed,D-did you mean to imply you drop them for other people? O-or mostly just yourself?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:palutena,alsoPlaying:lyn=embarrassed,Well, two green haired women... Do your... You know... erm, match?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=embarrassed,Um. Just less while naked.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:red=excited,Or is it something like my earrings? <i>What?</i> Is your <i>sword</i> a Miraculous!?
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:saki=embarrassed,(I just feel a strong urge to protect her... Especially now...)
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:saki=embarrassed,(I feel such a strong need to protect Saki...)
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayaka=embarrassed,Um, Sayaka, I don't think I've ever faced an akuma like this before. Maybe witches are much scarier...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayori=confident,O-oh, well, I wouldn't stare! But I think it's great you're happy with your appearance like this! I like to groom, but I think I get really self-conscious about how I look. I'm proud for you, Sayori!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:scarlet_witch=excited,Oh my! That’s definitely magic I’ve never seen!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:scarlet_witch,alsoPlaying:hermione=wink,Oh! So like how Hermione has been removing her small stuff. It’s… Interesting you saved it for last!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=embarrassed,Um... is... all this talk about taking on water... a euphemism, Shimakaze? It's... very elaborate.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola=embarrassed,Sola, I'm sorry that my original question about the matching is going to be answered... please don't hex me.
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight=confused,T-Twilight, usually that's something that comes off last!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight=alarmed,W-wait everyone will be able to see your-
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,alsoPlaying:nagisa=embarrassed,U-uh, Nagisa, shouldn't we tell Twilight not to...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:uravity=wink,It must be super cool to be able to fly or float like you do!
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=bored,Or you could roll the die again. I really hope you're not just resetting your clothes...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=bored,Just for your consideration: having good luck means <i>not</i> needing to rely on it...
3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:blake,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=embarrassed,So, Blake… Um… Shaves… Her… Chat…
3-female_crotch_is_visible,alsoPlaying:mulan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:duel_lost=wink,You mentioned a spirit guide… and you're from what seems to be Ancient China… do you know anything about the Miraculouses?

3-female_crotch_is_visible,totalExposed:2-4,saidMarker:bodysuit,count-bodysuit:2,count-bodysuit:3,count-bodysuit:4=alarmed,I-it just seems like a lot of work for not a lot of benefit… Does it really feel that much better?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:dark-skinned=excited,Oh, wow, you really look cool, ~name~!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=alarmed,T-that’s very... Eastern of you, both European and otherwise.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=confused,Ow, that seems like it would hurt a lot to maintain.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed=confident,Oh, maybe I’ll try that style!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=confused,... Did you just... Climax... ?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:alpha,marker:smooth_criminal=wink,Looks like you were struck by a <i>smooth</i> criminal.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=alarmed,H-hey! You can't do that! No fair!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:lyn=excited,See! It matches for people with non-typical hair colors too!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:palutena=excited,See! It matches for people with non-typical hair colors too!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ann=embarrassed,Oh. I see that it is. W-well! It adds a new element to your career! U-uhm. I mean, in modeling. Not this.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:annie=wink,Tell me about it, Annie. There’s just not enough hours in the day… But I find that spending time in the shower to trim and groom. If you feel good, and look good, you can do your best!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blackrose=alarmed,Whoa. I haven’t… Erm, seen many, but that’s particularly pretty!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:yang,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=alarmed,O-oh I was expecting to say you had a… ah, fuzzy… B-but I guess this way you don’t get hair in each other’s mouths?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy=embarrassed,I'm so sorry your clothes keep getting damaged. If um. You want, after this, I can loan you some of my stuff? Because we match! In... various ways!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy,alsoPlaying:chun-li=embarrassed,Ow! I don't think I'd let a friend help me undress like that! (Yikes...)
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=alarmed,Goodness. Don't you fight a lot of battles? How on earth do you have time to maintain something like that?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=confused,U-uhm. Corrin, with your ears, should I believe that all of your people look like that... or?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:daria=bored,O-oh. Well, that trick again. I see. Well played, Daria.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dawn=embarrassed,I-Eep. I’m going to stop talking now.

3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=confident,W-well, I'm sure your partners will appreciate that, anyway...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba=alarmed,I can't believe you didn't wear underwear!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:gwen=alarmed,Um. I don’t like the sound of this...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri=alarmed,U-uhm. Y-you're just very hairy! Most European girls I know um. Take care of that in other ways.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:d.va,alsoPlayingStage:6-8,marker:korean_trends=embarrassed,Er... Hana, does yours... er... get that hairy when you don't shave? Or is Juri just out of touch with Korean beauty trends?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kimberly=excited,I tend to prefer lots of sunblock, but that looks <i>super</i> cool, Kimberly! I'll have to try the look. We even... um, trim the same!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyoko=alarmed,I-I'm not saying I'll, I just meant that you, I mean, uhm. Want to try on a Miraculous instead? Maybe... a spider, for making connections?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu=confident,After the game, would you show me where you got those? Or maybe, I could trade you? I bet I could fit!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:launch=embarrassed,W-well, that's... half of the question answered, I suppose.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lilith=embarrassed,But your tattoos are cool! W-wait, you didn’t think I meant your... piercings or... your... uhm, patterning…
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lux=wink,It’s not supposed to match for blondes, is it? So that’s pretty normal. The contrast is pretty striking, given your light magic. Looks like you have a dark spot after all!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,marker:unusual_blue_hair=bored,Er. I’m still not used to seeing women bare like this. It’s unusual to see blue hair in the first place so…
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=bored,Yikes. That looks rode hard and put away… um… Wet. I believe is the expression.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=alarmed,You can climax just by… Thinking? Now <i>That’s</i> a superpower.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nagisa=confident,Stay with it, Nagisa. If you don’t give up, you might lose, but you’re not defeated!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki=wink,Just like my friend Alyx! She also has pink hair. And um, grooms like you do.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:navi=alarmed,I'm really awkward about this, I can't think about you except how much you remind me of Tikki and it's so <i>weird</i>!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=alarmed,E-er... I think it's okay to be excited. I-I mean, it's only natural. Not weird. O-or anything like that. S-so, just yenjoy ourself-- enjoy yourself, Nayru!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=excited,Oh, what a relief! We have the same style--of um. You know! I think you must've just trimmed fresh today, though, <i>oui</i>?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:palutena=alarmed,I-I suppose a memory is words a thousand worths. Worth a thousand words!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:palutena,alsoPlaying:lyn=bored,Oh. Well, that’s one way of being unique.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=confident,Maybe after this, you could show me some grappling stuff, huh, Mika?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven=embarrassed,We’re both mixed women, we both fight evil, we both like bodysuits... We both don’t... shave our... er... nevermind.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:red=wink,The Kwami inside seems to know you pretty well. It’s weird that you haven’t transformed yet, though.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ruby=wink,Oh, I see at least the leader does what she wants.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki=alarmed,W-wow, you sure are hairy, Saki! (Oh come on, Marinette!)
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki=alarmed,W-well, I think we all see you now, Saki! (Marinette, that's not what you should've said!)
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sayaka=alarmed,O-oh! You're... so hairy! I make sure to trim, most of the time, anyway... er... not that anyone needed to know that...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:scarlet_witch=embarrassed,Well, that’s not true, my costume just vanishes when I run out of force...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:scarlet_witch,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=confused,A-are you also going to use magic to do… Um… What she did?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shimakaze=wink,W-well, less elaborate than how you groom, I suppose.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola=alarmed,Hex, Sola! I-I'm not quite ready f-for whatever you thought I was suggesting even though I'm... In... this game...
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:7=alarmed,W-wait, you removed your clothes instead of that hat and camera?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight=alarmed,That’s definitely not human behavior! Are you a giant Kwami, or something else?
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity=alarmed,It makes your breasts look stunning too! Er, you look stunned, um… erk-- j-just keep at it, Ochako!
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:videl=confused,U-um. I think I have some questions about why you do that. You know. As a fighter.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=confused,You're... You're sad. You're just <i>so</i> sad, Vriska. Come here and let me break your die, and just de-Akumatize you already.
3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=confused,I'm sorry, Vriska. But you really should just quit.

4-female_large_chest_is_visible,filter:scarred,priority:0=bored,Oh ~name~... I'm sorry, whatever happened to you, I wish I could lucky charm it away...
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,filter:scarred,priority:0=bored,~name~, your scars look really cool, actually! I-I know that might not make them less... you know, personal. But they're part of you, and I think that's respectable.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:april,targetStage:3=excited,Donnie? Oh! You have someone special?
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=alarmed,Uh-hm. When I said I worked with another kitty, I did mean another person. N-not something else.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=embarrassed,Um... S-sorry Felicia, you look <i>vaguely</i> like someone I've spent a lot of time with... Just... Female and not dark.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena=excited,Oh! I wasn’t expecting...After the belts...Wow. I can see why the statues in your likeness have so many references to heavenly spheres.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena=embarrassed,Oh, don’t be so ashamed. We’re all here having fun, Palutena. There’s nothing wrong with nudity… Except the staring. And embarrassment. Okay, I’m sorry.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=wink,Um… I commend you for keeping the mask on, though. Is that for a secret identity, or just dedication to your craft?
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:shantae=alarmed,Maybe your dance is just so distracting that I dreamed the whole conversation up?
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:uravity=wink,No extra bug heroes yet! But it’s always great to meet new teammates!
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:uravity=embarrassed,Er, cat-themed you say? I think one cat-themed superhero is enough for my life.
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:blake=alarmed,You know, I think I could do to meet new cat-themed superheroes… just to compare them to my Cat Noir. N-not <i>mine</i> mine, mind mew. Erk--
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:gwen=wink,I have a feeling I’ll be making a new teammate after this game, actually... I think she’s more arachnid themed, though!
4-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:yang=embarrassed,I-I'm a bit jealous your figure and personality and friendships come so easily, is all.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible=excited,Bye-bye little butterfly.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:2,marker:ztentacles=embarrassed,I can imagine more fun things to do involving that than… I-I mean not personally but… Um…!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,totalExposed:2-4,saidMarker:bodysuit,count-bodysuit:2,count-bodysuit:3,count-bodysuit:4=embarrassed,Um…~name~, do you shave? I get a feeling I’m the only person with a body suit who… Doesn’t.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:rwby=embarrassed,I heard a rumor from a friend that you all shave down there... Is that like, a bonding experience?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:thong,priority:0=bored,At least you'll be out of your thong, ~name~. That <i>can't</i> be comfortable.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:thong,priority:0=confused,I think thongs are just... super uncomfortable. But no panty lines... I think I'd have a bigger issue with that if not for my costume.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:thong,priority:0=alarmed,At least you don't have to wear your thong anymore, ~name~. How a day-long wedgie is at all comfortable is beyond me.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=alarmed,Y-you're really going to just? Wearing so little?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ann=alarmed,I-I mean if it is, that's great. People like to ask about mine a lot.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:blackrose=confident,Oh! Blackrose, I-I know it’s hard to lose but, hopefully whatever you have is particularly um...exotic?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:yang,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=alarmed,I know you aren’t a fan of… Um… Chat… Jokes, Blake…
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:cammy=alarmed,Cammy! Why do they keep attacking you!?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:cammy,alsoPlaying:chun-li=alarmed,...! I-I...!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:d.va,targetSaidMarker:d.va_high_score,alsoPlaying:moon=confused,Wait, is the goal of this game to get naked fastest? Is that why Moon plays like she does?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:d.va,targetSaidMarker:d.va_high_score,totalExposed:1-2=bored,U-uhm. D.Va, it’s only the high score if you’re winning, right? I don’t really think... Er... Maybe you’re playing another game?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:daria=embarrassed,(I'm kind of hoping I get to see it, she's been teasing herself for a while...)
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:dawn,targetStage:7=bored,I mean, most people already know they’re supposed to match... Mine does, obviously...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elaine=excited,O-oh. W-well, this is a nice view, even if <i>I'm</i> not a fan of that style of underwear...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elaine=excited,Y-you know, I have to say, I'm understanding the appeal of that kind of underwear...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elaine=excited,At least it's not <i>entirely</i> up your butt, Elaine.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elizabeth=alarmed,Wait I meant running! Oh no, you'll be doing both soon, argh! I'm so sorry!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=embarrassed,I-I appreciate few yallowing--- You following the rules, Felicia, b-but it's just kind of... Not what I was expecting!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen=embarrassed,What?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri=embarrassed,E-er. I guess you really are from Korea!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kimberly=embarrassed,Kimberly, I know we just met but... I've never seen tan lines on someone's... you know. I-I hope it doesn't cross a line if I look!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyoko=embarrassed,I have a really bad feeling that you'd be a very strong supervillain... I-I think I should help you unwind before you get too stressed!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu=embarrassed,But I can’t help but feel it’d be uniquely confident to wear a pair of butterfly underwear like that!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:launch=alarmed,Launch matches... um... between sneezes... (She doesn't seem <i>too</i> akumatizable, just... irritated...)
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nagisa=wink,W-what, of course you’re cute!

4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:navi=embarrassed,Um, er, no, not, what you're-- about-- no, I mean, the literal--
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=embarrassed,I um. Think your friendship reminds me of Cat Noir and his kwami. They seem to argue a bit more than Tikki and I.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=wink,Just keep a brave face, okay, Nayru?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=embarrassed,Um. Yang, does Neo hate you, or… Like you?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:palutena=embarrassed,D-did you mean to imply you drop them for other people? O-or mostly just yourself?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:palutena,alsoPlaying:lyn=embarrassed,Well, two green haired women... Do your... You know... erm, match?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=embarrassed,Um. Just less while naked.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:red=excited,Or is it something like my earrings? <i>What?</i> Is your <i>sword</i> a Miraculous!?
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:saki=embarrassed,(I just feel a strong urge to protect her... Especially now...)
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:saki=embarrassed,(I feel such a strong need to protect Saki...)
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayaka=embarrassed,Um, Sayaka, I don't think I've ever faced an akuma like this before. Maybe witches are much scarier...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayori=confident,O-oh, well, I wouldn't stare! But I think it's great you're happy with your appearance like this! I like to groom, but I think I get really self-conscious about how I look. I'm proud for you, Sayori!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:scarlet_witch=excited,Oh my! That’s definitely magic I’ve never seen!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:scarlet_witch,alsoPlaying:hermione=wink,Oh! So like how Hermione has been removing her small stuff. It’s… Interesting you saved it for last!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=embarrassed,Um... is... all this talk about taking on water... a euphemism, Shimakaze? It's... very elaborate.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola=embarrassed,Sola, I'm sorry that my original question about the matching is going to be answered... please don't hex me.
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight=confused,T-Twilight, usually that's something that comes off last!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight=alarmed,W-wait everyone will be able to see your-
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,alsoPlaying:nagisa=embarrassed,U-uh, Nagisa, shouldn't we tell Twilight not to...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:uravity=wink,It must be super cool to be able to fly or float like you do!
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=bored,Or you could roll the die again. I really hope you're not just resetting your clothes...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=bored,Just for your consideration: having good luck means <i>not</i> needing to rely on it...
4-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:blake,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=embarrassed,So, Blake… Um… Shaves… Her… Chat…
4-female_crotch_is_visible,alsoPlaying:mulan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:duel_lost=wink,You mentioned a spirit guide… and you're from what seems to be Ancient China… do you know anything about the Miraculouses?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,alsoPlaying:sheena,alsoPlayingStage:8-10,notSaidMarker:hotsprings,marker:hotsprings=embarrassed,Sheena, you mean explored as in… The area--The area of the water and rocks, not, all of us girls, right?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:dark-skinned=excited,Oh, wow, you really look cool, ~name~!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=embarrassed,T-that’s very... Eastern of you, both European and otherwise.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=excited,Ow, that seems like it would hurt a lot to maintain.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed=calm,Oh, maybe I’ll try that style!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=confused,... Did you just... Climax... ?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:alpha,marker:smooth_criminal=wink,Looks like you were struck by a <i>smooth</i> criminal.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=alarmed,H-hey! You can't do that! No fair!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:lyn=excited,See! It matches for people with non-typical hair colors too!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:palutena=excited,See! It matches for people with non-typical hair colors too!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ann=embarrassed,Oh. I see that it is. W-well! It adds a new element to your career! U-uhm. I mean, in modeling. Not this.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:annie=wink,Tell me about it, Annie. There’s just not enough hours in the day… But I find that spending time in the shower to trim and groom. If you feel good, and look good, you can do your best!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blackrose=alarmed,Whoa. I haven’t… Erm, seen many, but that’s particularly pretty!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:yang,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=alarmed,O-oh I was expecting to say you had a… ah, fuzzy… B-but I guess this way you don’t get hair in each other’s mouths?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy=embarrassed,I'm so sorry your clothes keep getting damaged. If um. You want, after this, I can loan you some of my stuff? Because we match! In... various ways!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy,alsoPlaying:chun-li=embarrassed,Ow! I don't think I'd let a friend help me undress like that! (Yikes...)
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=alarmed,Goodness. Don't you fight a lot of battles? How on earth do you have time to maintain something like that?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=confused,U-uhm. Corrin, with your ears, should I believe that all of your people look like that... or?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:daria=bored,O-oh. Well, that trick again. I see. Well played, Daria.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dawn=embarrassed,I-Eep. I’m going to stop talking now.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elaine=alarmed,<i>C'est tout à fait le cul!</i>
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elaine=alarmed,Quite the tattoo, Elaine! You must've had it for a long time!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=confident,W-well, I'm sure your partners will appreciate that, anyway...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba=alarmed,I can't believe you didn't wear underwear!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:gwen=alarmed,Um. I don’t like the sound of this...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri=alarmed,U-uhm. Y-you're just very hairy! Most European girls I know um. Take care of that in other ways.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:d.va,alsoPlayingStage:6-8,marker:korean_trends=embarrassed,Er... Hana, does yours... er... get that hairy when you don't shave? Or is Juri just out of touch with Korean beauty trends?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kimberly=excited,I tend to prefer lots of sunblock, but that looks <i>super</i> cool, Kimberly! I'll have to try the look. We even... um, trim the same!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyoko=alarmed,I-I'm not saying I'll, I just meant that you, I mean, uhm. Want to try on a Miraculous instead? Maybe... a spider, for making connections?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu=confident,After the game, would you show me where you got those? Or maybe, I could trade you? I bet I could fit!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:launch=embarrassed,W-well, that's... half of the question answered, I suppose.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lilith=embarrassed,But your tattoos are cool! W-wait, you didn’t think I meant your... piercings or... your... uhm, patterning…
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lux=wink,It’s not supposed to match for blondes, is it? So that’s pretty normal. The contrast is pretty striking, given your light magic. Looks like you have a dark spot after all!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,marker:unusual_blue_hair=bored,Er. I’m still not used to seeing women bare like this. It’s unusual to see blue hair in the first place so…
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=bored,Yikes. That looks rode hard and put away… um… Wet. I believe is the expression.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=alarmed,You can climax just by… Thinking? Now <i>That’s</i> a superpower.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nagisa=confident,Stay with it, Nagisa. If you don’t give up, you might lose, but you’re not defeated!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki=wink,Just like my friend Alyx! She also has pink hair. And um, grooms like you do.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:navi=alarmed,I'm really awkward about this, I can't think about you except how much you remind me of Tikki and it's so <i>weird</i>!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=alarmed,E-er... I think it's okay to be excited. I-I mean, it's only natural. Not weird. O-or anything like that. S-so, just yenjoy ourself-- enjoy yourself, Nayru!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=excited,Oh, what a relief! We have the same style--of um. You know! I think you must've just trimmed fresh today, though, <i>oui</i>?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:palutena=alarmed,I-I suppose a memory is words a thousand worths. Worth a thousand words!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:palutena,alsoPlaying:lyn=bored,Oh. Well, that’s one way of being unique.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=confident,Maybe after this, you could show me some grappling stuff, huh, Mika?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven=embarrassed,We’re both mixed women, we both fight evil, we both like bodysuits... We both don’t... shave our... er... nevermind.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:red=wink,The Kwami inside seems to know you pretty well. It’s weird that you haven’t transformed yet, though.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ruby=wink,Oh, I see at least the leader does what she wants.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki=alarmed,W-wow, you sure are hairy, Saki! (Oh come on, Marinette!)
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki=alarmed,W-well, I think we all see you now, Saki! (Marinette, that's not what you should've said!)
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sayaka=alarmed,O-oh! You're... so hairy! I make sure to trim, most of the time, anyway... er... not that anyone needed to know that...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:scarlet_witch=embarrassed,Well, that’s not true, my costume just vanishes when I run out of force...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:scarlet_witch,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=confused,A-are you also going to use magic to do… Um… What she did?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shimakaze=wink,W-well, less elaborate than how you groom, I suppose.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola=alarmed,Hex, Sola! I-I'm not quite ready f-for whatever you thought I was suggesting even though I'm... In... this game...
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:7=alarmed,W-wait, you removed your clothes instead of that hat and camera?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight=alarmed,That’s definitely not human behavior! Are you a giant Kwami, or something else?
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity=alarmed,It makes your breasts look stunning too! Er, you look stunned, um… erk-- j-just keep at it, Ochako!
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:videl=confused,U-um. I think I have some questions about why you do that. You know. As a fighter.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=confused,You're... You're sad. You're just <i>so</i> sad, Vriska. Come here and let me break your die, and just de-Akumatize you already.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=confused,I'm sorry, Vriska. But you really should just quit.
4-female_crotch_is_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:blake,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=alarmed,D-does that make it easier for you two to… You know? Soixante neuf?

5-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena=excited,Oh! I wasn’t expecting...After the belts...Wow. I can see why the statues in your likeness have so many references to heavenly spheres.
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena=embarrassed,Oh, don’t be so ashamed. We’re all here having fun, Palutena. There’s nothing wrong with nudity… Except the staring. And embarrassment. Okay, I’m sorry.
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=wink,Um… I commend you for keeping the mask on, though. Is that for a secret identity, or just dedication to your craft?
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:shantae=alarmed,Maybe your dance is just so distracting that I dreamed the whole conversation up?
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:uravity=wink,No extra bug heroes yet! But it’s always great to meet new teammates!
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:uravity=embarrassed,Er, cat-themed you say? I think one cat-themed superhero is enough for my life.
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:blake=alarmed,You know, I think I could do to meet new cat-themed superheroes… just to compare them to my Cat Noir. N-not <i>mine</i> mine, mind mew. Erk--
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:gwen=wink,I have a feeling I’ll be making a new teammate after this game, actually... I think she’s more arachnid themed, though!
5-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:yang=embarrassed,I-I'm a bit jealous your figure and personality and friendships come so easily, is all.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:2,marker:ztentacles=embarrassed,I can imagine more fun things to do involving that than… I-I mean not personally but… Um…!
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,totalExposed:2-4,saidMarker:bodysuit,count-bodysuit:2,count-bodysuit:3,count-bodysuit:4=embarrassed,Um…~name~, do you shave? I get a feeling I’m the only person with a body suit who… Doesn’t.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:rwby=embarrassed,I heard a rumor from a friend that you all shave down there... Is that like, a bonding experience?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:thong,priority:0=bored,At least you'll be out of your thong, ~name~. That <i>can't</i> be comfortable.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:thong,priority:0=confused,I think thongs are just... super uncomfortable. But no panty lines... I think I'd have a bigger issue with that if not for my costume.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:thong,priority:0=alarmed,At least you don't have to wear your thong anymore, ~name~. How a day-long wedgie is at all comfortable is beyond me.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=alarmed,Y-you're really going to just? Wearing so little?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ann=alarmed,I-I mean if it is, that's great. People like to ask about mine a lot.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:blackrose=confident,Oh! Blackrose, I-I know it’s hard to lose but, hopefully whatever you have is particularly um...exotic?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:yang,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=alarmed,I know you aren’t a fan of… Um… Chat… Jokes, Blake…
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:cammy=alarmed,Cammy! Why do they keep attacking you!?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:cammy,alsoPlaying:chun-li=alarmed,...! I-I...!
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:d.va,targetSaidMarker:d.va_high_score,alsoPlaying:moon=confused,Wait, is the goal of this game to get naked fastest? Is that why Moon plays like she does?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:d.va,targetSaidMarker:d.va_high_score,totalExposed:1-2=bored,U-uhm. D.Va, it’s only the high score if you’re winning, right? I don’t really think... Er... Maybe you’re playing another game?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:daria=embarrassed,(I'm kind of hoping I get to see it, she's been teasing herself for a while...)
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:dawn,targetStage:7=bored,I mean, most people already know they’re supposed to match... Mine does, obviously...
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elaine=excited,O-oh. W-well, this is a nice view, even if <i>I'm</i> not a fan of that style of underwear...
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elaine=excited,Y-you know, I have to say, I'm understanding the appeal of that kind of underwear...
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elaine=excited,At least it's not <i>entirely</i> up your butt, Elaine.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elizabeth=alarmed,Wait I meant running! Oh no, you'll be doing both soon, argh! I'm so sorry!
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=embarrassed,I-I appreciate few yallowing--- You following the rules, Felicia, b-but it's just kind of... Not what I was expecting!
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen=embarrassed,What?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri=embarrassed,E-er. I guess you really are from Korea!
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kimberly=embarrassed,Kimberly, I know we just met but... I've never seen tan lines on someone's... you know. I-I hope it doesn't cross a line if I look!
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyoko=embarrassed,I have a really bad feeling that you'd be a very strong supervillain... I-I think I should help you unwind before you get too stressed!
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu=embarrassed,But I can’t help but feel it’d be uniquely confident to wear a pair of butterfly underwear like that!
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:launch=alarmed,Launch matches... um... between sneezes... (She doesn't seem <i>too</i> akumatizable, just... irritated...)
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nagisa=wink,W-what, of course you’re cute!
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nagisa=embarrassed,A-as a friend, court you’re of yute! I- I’m. Er..
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:monika,marker:trapsuki=alarmed,E-er, what is it you're implying about Natsuki, Monika...?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:navi=embarrassed,Um, er, no, not, what you're-- about-- no, I mean, the literal--
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=embarrassed,I um. Think your friendship reminds me of Cat Noir and his kwami. They seem to argue a bit more than Tikki and I.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=wink,Just keep a brave face, okay, Nayru?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=embarrassed,Um. Yang, does Neo hate you, or… Like you?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:palutena=embarrassed,D-did you mean to imply you drop them for other people? O-or mostly just yourself?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:palutena,alsoPlaying:lyn=embarrassed,Well, two green haired women... Do your... You know... erm, match?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=embarrassed,Um. Just less while naked.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:red=excited,Or is it something like my earrings? <i>What?</i> Is your <i>sword</i> a Miraculous!?
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:saki=embarrassed,(I just feel a strong urge to protect her... Especially now...)
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:saki=embarrassed,(I feel such a strong need to protect Saki...)
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayaka=embarrassed,Um, Sayaka, I don't think I've ever faced an akuma like this before. Maybe witches are much scarier...
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayori=confident,O-oh, well, I wouldn't stare! But I think it's great you're happy with your appearance like this! I like to groom, but I think I get really self-conscious about how I look. I'm proud for you, Sayori!
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:scarlet_witch=excited,Oh my! That’s definitely magic I’ve never seen!
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:scarlet_witch,alsoPlaying:hermione=wink,Oh! So like how Hermione has been removing her small stuff. It’s… Interesting you saved it for last!
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=embarrassed,Um... is... all this talk about taking on water... a euphemism, Shimakaze? It's... very elaborate.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola=embarrassed,Sola, I'm sorry that my original question about the matching is going to be answered... please don't hex me.
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight=confused,T-Twilight, usually that's something that comes off last!
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight=alarmed,W-wait everyone will be able to see your-
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,alsoPlaying:nagisa=embarrassed,U-uh, Nagisa, shouldn't we tell Twilight not to...
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:uravity=wink,It must be super cool to be able to fly or float like you do!
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=bored,Or you could roll the die again. I really hope you're not just resetting your clothes...
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=bored,Just for your consideration: having good luck means <i>not</i> needing to rely on it...
5-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:blake,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=embarrassed,So, Blake… Um… Shaves… Her… Chat…
5-female_crotch_is_visible=alarmed,Oh, I do mine a little differently--I mean, uh, never mind, look at her!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,alsoPlaying:mulan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:duel_lost=wink,You mentioned a spirit guide… and you're from what seems to be Ancient China… do you know anything about the Miraculouses?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,alsoPlaying:sheena,alsoPlayingStage:8-10,notSaidMarker:hotsprings,marker:hotsprings=embarrassed,Sheena, you mean explored as in… The area--The area of the water and rocks, not, all of us girls, right?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,totalExposed:2-4,saidMarker:bodysuit,count-bodysuit:2,count-bodysuit:3,count-bodysuit:4=alarmed,I-it just seems like a lot of work for not a lot of benefit… Does it really feel that much better?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=embarrassed,T-that’s very... Eastern of you, both European and otherwise.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=confused,Ow, that seems like it would hurt a lot to maintain.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed=confident,Oh, maybe I’ll try that style!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=confused,... Did you just... Climax... ?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:alpha,marker:smooth_criminal=wink,Looks like you were struck by a <i>smooth</i> criminal.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=alarmed,H-hey! You can't do that! No fair!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:lyn=excited,See! It matches for people with non-typical hair colors too!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:palutena=excited,See! It matches for people with non-typical hair colors too!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ann=embarrassed,Oh. I see that it is. W-well! It adds a new element to your career! U-uhm. I mean, in modeling. Not this.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:annie=wink,Tell me about it, Annie. There’s just not enough hours in the day… But I find that spending time in the shower to trim and groom. If you feel good, and look good, you can do your best!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blackrose=alarmed,Whoa. I haven’t… Erm, seen many, but that’s particularly pretty!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:yang,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=alarmed,O-oh I was expecting to say you had a… ah, fuzzy… B-but I guess this way you don’t get hair in each other’s mouths?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy=embarrassed,I'm so sorry your clothes keep getting damaged. If um. You want, after this, I can loan you some of my stuff? Because we match! In... various ways!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy,alsoPlaying:chun-li=embarrassed,Ow! I don't think I'd let a friend help me undress like that! (Yikes...)
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=alarmed,Goodness. Don't you fight a lot of battles? How on earth do you have time to maintain something like that?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=confused,U-uhm. Corrin, with your ears, should I believe that all of your people look like that... or?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:daria=bored,O-oh. Well, that trick again. I see. Well played, Daria.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dawn=embarrassed,I-Eep. I’m going to stop talking now.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elaine=alarmed,<i>C'est tout à fait le cul!</i>
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elaine=alarmed,Quite the tattoo, Elaine! You must've had it for a long time!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=confident,W-well, I'm sure your partners will appreciate that, anyway...
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba=alarmed,I can't believe you didn't wear underwear!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:gwen=alarmed,Um. I don’t like the sound of this...
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri=alarmed,U-uhm. Y-you're just very hairy! Most European girls I know um. Take care of that in other ways.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:d.va,alsoPlayingStage:6-8,marker:korean_trends=embarrassed,Er... Hana, does yours... er... get that hairy when you don't shave? Or is Juri just out of touch with Korean beauty trends?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kimberly=excited,I tend to prefer lots of sunblock, but that looks <i>super</i> cool, Kimberly! I'll have to try the look. We even... um, trim the same!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyoko=alarmed,I-I'm not saying I'll, I just meant that you, I mean, uhm. Want to try on a Miraculous instead? Maybe... a spider, for making connections?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu=confident,After the game, would you show me where you got those? Or maybe, I could trade you? I bet I could fit!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:launch=embarrassed,W-well, that's... half of the question answered, I suppose.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lilith=embarrassed,But your tattoos are cool! W-wait, you didn’t think I meant your... piercings or... your... uhm, patterning…
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lux=wink,It’s not supposed to match for blondes, is it? So that’s pretty normal. The contrast is pretty striking, given your light magic. Looks like you have a dark spot after all!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,marker:unusual_blue_hair=bored,Er. I’m still not used to seeing women bare like this. It’s unusual to see blue hair in the first place so…
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=bored,Yikes. That looks rode hard and put away… um… Wet. I believe is the expression.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=alarmed,You can climax just by… Thinking? Now <i>That’s</i> a superpower.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nagisa=confident,Stay with it, Nagisa. If you don’t give up, you might lose, but you’re not defeated!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki=wink,Just like my friend Alyx! She also has pink hair. And um, grooms like you do.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:navi=alarmed,I'm really awkward about this, I can't think about you except how much you remind me of Tikki and it's so <i>weird</i>!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=alarmed,E-er... I think it's okay to be excited. I-I mean, it's only natural. Not weird. O-or anything like that. S-so, just yenjoy ourself-- enjoy yourself, Nayru!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=excited,Oh, what a relief! We have the same style--of um. You know! I think you must've just trimmed fresh today, though, <i>oui</i>?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:palutena=alarmed,I-I suppose a memory is words a thousand worths. Worth a thousand words!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:palutena,alsoPlaying:lyn=bored,Oh. Well, that’s one way of being unique.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=confident,Maybe after this, you could show me some grappling stuff, huh, Mika?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven=embarrassed,We’re both mixed women, we both fight evil, we both like bodysuits... We both don’t... shave our... er... nevermind.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:red=wink,The Kwami inside seems to know you pretty well. It’s weird that you haven’t transformed yet, though.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ruby=wink,Oh, I see at least the leader does what she wants.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki=alarmed,W-wow, you sure are hairy, Saki! (Oh come on, Marinette!)
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki=alarmed,W-well, I think we all see you now, Saki! (Marinette, that's not what you should've said!)
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sayaka=alarmed,O-oh! You're... so hairy! I make sure to trim, most of the time, anyway... er... not that anyone needed to know that...
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:scarlet_witch=embarrassed,Well, that’s not true, my costume just vanishes when I run out of force...
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:scarlet_witch,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=confused,A-are you also going to use magic to do… Um… What she did?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shimakaze=wink,W-well, less elaborate than how you groom, I suppose.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola=alarmed,Hex, Sola! I-I'm not quite ready f-for whatever you thought I was suggesting even though I'm... In... this game...
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:7=alarmed,W-wait, you removed your clothes instead of that hat and camera?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight=alarmed,That’s definitely not human behavior! Are you a giant Kwami, or something else?
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity=alarmed,It makes your breasts look stunning too! Er, you look stunned, um… erk-- j-just keep at it, Ochako!
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:videl=confused,U-um. I think I have some questions about why you do that. You know. As a fighter.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=confused,You're... You're sad. You're just <i>so</i> sad, Vriska. Come here and let me break your die, and just de-Akumatize you already.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=confused,I'm sorry, Vriska. But you really should just quit.
5-female_crotch_is_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:blake,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=alarmed,D-does that make it easier for you two to… You know? Soixante neuf?

6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu,count-pink_hair:2=wink,I suppose the other pink-haired lady can show me if it can be natural or not!
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:ginger=alarmed,Y-you know, I did say your hair was pretty earlier but I’d be super shocked if it matched.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:rwby=embarrassed,I heard a rumor from a friend that you all shave down there... Is that like, a bonding experience?
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:thong,priority:0=bored,At least you'll be out of your thong, ~name~. That <i>can't</i> be comfortable.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:thong,priority:0=confused,I think thongs are just... super uncomfortable. But no panty lines... I think I'd have a bigger issue with that if not for my costume.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:thong,priority:0=alarmed,At least you don't have to wear your thong anymore, ~name~. How a day-long wedgie is at all comfortable is beyond me.

6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ann=alarmed,I-I mean if it is, that's great. People like to ask about mine a lot.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:blackrose=confident,Oh! Blackrose, I-I know it’s hard to lose but, hopefully whatever you have is particularly um...exotic?

6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:navi=embarrassed,Um, er, no, not, what you're-- about-- no, I mean, the literal--
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=embarrassed,I um. Think your friendship reminds me of Cat Noir and his kwami. They seem to argue a bit more than Tikki and I.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=wink,Just keep a brave face, okay, Nayru?
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=embarrassed,Um. Yang, does Neo hate you, or… Like you?

6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayaka=embarrassed,Um, Sayaka, I don't think I've ever faced an akuma like this before. Maybe witches are much scarier...
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayori=confident,O-oh, well, I wouldn't stare! But I think it's great you're happy with your appearance like this! I like to groom, but I think I get really self-conscious about how I look. I'm proud for you, Sayori!
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:scarlet_witch=excited,Oh my! That’s definitely magic I’ve never seen!
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:scarlet_witch,alsoPlaying:hermione=wink,Oh! So like how Hermione has been removing her small stuff. It’s… Interesting you saved it for last!
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=embarrassed,Um... is... all this talk about taking on water... a euphemism, Shimakaze? It's... very elaborate.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola=embarrassed,Sola, I'm sorry that my original question about the matching is going to be answered... please don't hex me.
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight=confused,T-Twilight, usually that's something that comes off last!

6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:uravity=wink,It must be super cool to be able to fly or float like you do!
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=bored,Or you could roll the die again. I really hope you're not just resetting your clothes...
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=bored,Just for your consideration: having good luck means <i>not</i> needing to rely on it...
6-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:blake,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=embarrassed,So, Blake… Um… Shaves… Her… Chat…
6-female_crotch_is_visible=alarmed,O-Oh, I like that style a lot. I think I’ll try it... at some point. T-the style. Not the  p-pussy.

6-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:ginger=excited,That’s so cool, ~name~! I bet you get complimented on it whenever you take off your underwear. Not that it happens a lot. Or if it did that’s your business? Either way, tres belle!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=confident,Hmm. ~name~, I’m not usually a fan of the all natural look… Many people seem to like it, though!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=embarrassed,Y-yikes, ~name~, how do you get it so...shiny?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed=wink,Oh! That’s cute, ~name~. I-I mean, aesthetically!

6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=alarmed,H-hey! You can't do that! No fair!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:lyn=excited,See! It matches for people with non-typical hair colors too!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:palutena=excited,See! It matches for people with non-typical hair colors too!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ann=embarrassed,Oh. I see that it is. W-well! It adds a new element to your career! U-uhm. I mean, in modeling. Not this.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:annie=wink,Tell me about it, Annie. There’s just not enough hours in the day… But I find that spending time in the shower to trim and groom. If you feel good, and look good, you can do your best!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blackrose=embarrassed,Between your tattoos...and hue...and...um...even your cute little tangle… I-it might even entice a straight girl into doing… Um… you know…
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:yang,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=alarmed,O-oh I was expecting to say you had a… ah, fuzzy… B-but I guess this way you don’t get hair in each other’s mouths?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy=embarrassed,I'm so sorry your clothes keep getting damaged. If um. You want, after this, I can loan you some of my stuff? Because we match! In... various ways!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy,alsoPlaying:chun-li=embarrassed,Ow! I don't think I'd let a friend help me undress like that! (Yikes...)
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=alarmed,Goodness. Don't you fight a lot of battles? How on earth do you have time to maintain something like that?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=confused,U-uhm. Corrin, with your ears, should I believe that all of your people look like that... or?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:daria=bored,O-oh. Well, that trick again. I see. Well played, Daria.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dawn=embarrassed,I-Eep. I’m going to stop talking now.

6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=confident,W-well, I'm sure your partners will appreciate that, anyway...
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba=alarmed,I can't believe you didn't wear underwear!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:gwen=alarmed,Um. I don’t like the sound of this...
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri=alarmed,U-uhm. Y-you're just very hairy! Most European girls I know um. Take care of that in other ways.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:d.va,alsoPlayingStage:6-8,marker:korean_trends=embarrassed,Er... Hana, does yours... er... get that hairy when you don't shave? Or is Juri just out of touch with Korean beauty trends?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kimberly=excited,I tend to prefer lots of sunblock, but that looks <i>super</i> cool, Kimberly! I'll have to try the look. We even... um, trim the same!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyoko=alarmed,I-I'm not saying I'll, I just meant that you, I mean, uhm. Want to try on a Miraculous instead? Maybe... a spider, for making connections?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu=calm,I definitely don’t like to take care of myself like that… But I will admit that look seems nice on you!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:launch=embarrassed,W-well, that's... half of the question answered, I suppose.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lilith=embarrassed,But your tattoos are cool! W-wait, you didn’t think I meant your... piercings or... your... uhm, patterning…
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lux=wink,It’s not supposed to match for blondes, is it? So that’s pretty normal. The contrast is pretty striking, given your light magic. Looks like you have a dark spot after all!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,marker:unusual_blue_hair=bored,Er. I’m still not used to seeing women bare like this. It’s unusual to see blue hair in the first place so…
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=bored,Yikes. That looks rode hard and put away… um… Wet. I believe is the expression.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=alarmed,You can climax just by… Thinking? Now <i>That’s</i> a superpower.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nagisa=confident,Stay with it, Nagisa. If you don’t give up, you might lose, but you’re not defeated!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki=wink,Just like my friend Alyx! She also has pink hair. And um, grooms like you do.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:navi=alarmed,I'm really awkward about this, I can't think about you except how much you remind me of Tikki and it's so <i>weird</i>!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=alarmed,E-er... I think it's okay to be excited. I-I mean, it's only natural. Not weird. O-or anything like that. S-so, just yenjoy ourself-- enjoy yourself, Nayru!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=excited,Oh, what a relief! We have the same style--of um. You know! I think you must've just trimmed fresh today, though, <i>oui</i>?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:palutena=alarmed,I-I suppose a memory is words a thousand worths. Worth a thousand words!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:palutena,alsoPlaying:lyn=bored,Oh. Well, that’s one way of being unique.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=confident,Maybe after this, you could show me some grappling stuff, huh, Mika?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven=embarrassed,We’re both mixed women, we both fight evil, we both like bodysuits... We both don’t... shave our... er... nevermind.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:red=wink,The Kwami inside seems to know you pretty well. It’s weird that you haven’t transformed yet, though.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ruby=wink,Oh, I see at least the leader does what she wants.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki=alarmed,W-wow, you sure are hairy, Saki! (Oh come on, Marinette!)
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki=alarmed,W-well, I think we all see you now, Saki! (Marinette, that's not what you should've said!)
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sayaka=alarmed,O-oh! You're... so hairy! I make sure to trim, most of the time, anyway... er... not that anyone needed to know that...
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:scarlet_witch=embarrassed,Well, that’s not true, my costume just vanishes when I run out of force...
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:scarlet_witch,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=confused,A-are you also going to use magic to do… Um… What she did?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shimakaze=wink,W-well, less elaborate than how you groom, I suppose.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola=alarmed,Hex, Sola! I-I'm not quite ready f-for whatever you thought I was suggesting even though I'm... In... this game...
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:7=alarmed,W-wait, you removed your clothes instead of that hat and camera?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight=alarmed,That’s definitely not human behavior! Are you a giant Kwami, or something else?
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity=alarmed,It makes your breasts look stunning too! Er, you look stunned, um… erk-- j-just keep at it, Ochako!
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:videl=confused,U-um. I think I have some questions about why you do that. You know. As a fighter.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=confused,You're... You're sad. You're just <i>so</i> sad, Vriska. Come here and let me break your die, and just de-Akumatize you already.
6-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=confused,I'm sorry, Vriska. But you really should just quit.

7-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=alarmed,Uh-hm. When I said I worked with another kitty, I did mean another person. N-not something else.
7-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=embarrassed,Um... S-sorry Felicia, you look <i>vaguely</i> like someone I've spent a lot of time with... Just... Female and not dark.
7-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena=excited,Oh! I wasn’t expecting...After the belts...Wow. I can see why the statues in your likeness have so many references to heavenly spheres.
7-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena=embarrassed,Oh, don’t be so ashamed. We’re all here having fun, Palutena. There’s nothing wrong with nudity… Except the staring. And embarrassment. Okay, I’m sorry.
7-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=wink,Um… I commend you for keeping the mask on, though. Is that for a secret identity, or just dedication to your craft?
7-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:shantae=alarmed,Maybe your dance is just so distracting that I dreamed the whole conversation up?
7-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:uravity=wink,No extra bug heroes yet! But it’s always great to meet new teammates!
7-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:uravity=embarrassed,Er, cat-themed you say? I think one cat-themed superhero is enough for my life.
7-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:blake=alarmed,You know, I think I could do to meet new cat-themed superheroes… just to compare them to my Cat Noir. N-not <i>mine</i> mine, mind mew. Erk--
7-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:daria=wink,Somehow, I don't think Ochako could go for that. If it were just me, though, maybe that'd even be kinda fun... M-maybe.
7-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:gwen=wink,I have a feeling I’ll be making a new teammate after this game, actually... I think she’s more arachnid themed, though!
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible=calm,Hmm...
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:2,marker:ztentacles=embarrassed,I can imagine more fun things to do involving that than… I-I mean not personally but… Um…!7-
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,totalExposed:2-4,saidMarker:bodysuit,count-bodysuit:2,count-bodysuit:3,count-bodysuit:4=embarrassed,Um…~name~, do you shave? I get a feeling I’m the only person with a body suit who… Doesn’t.
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu,count-pink_hair:2=wink,I suppose the other pink-haired lady can show me if it can be natural or not!
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:ginger=alarmed,Y-you know, I did say your hair was pretty earlier but I’d be super shocked if it matched.
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:rwby=embarrassed,I heard a rumor from a friend that you all shave down there... Is that like, a bonding experience?
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:thong,priority:0=bored,At least you'll be out of your thong, ~name~. That <i>can't</i> be comfortable.
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:thong,priority:0=confused,I think thongs are just... super uncomfortable. But no panty lines... I think I'd have a bigger issue with that if not for my costume.
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:thong,priority:0=alarmed,At least you don't have to wear your thong anymore, ~name~. How a day-long wedgie is at all comfortable is beyond me.
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=alarmed,Y-you're really going to just? Wearing so little?
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ann=alarmed,I-I mean if it is, that's great. People like to ask about mine a lot.
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:blackrose=confident,Oh! Blackrose, I-I know it’s hard to lose but, hopefully whatever you have is particularly um...exotic?
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:yang,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=alarmed,I know you aren’t a fan of… Um… Chat… Jokes, Blake…
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:cammy=alarmed,Cammy! Why do they keep attacking you!?
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:cammy,alsoPlaying:chun-li=alarmed,...! I-I...!
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:d.va,targetSaidMarker:d.va_high_score,alsoPlaying:moon=confused,Wait, is the goal of this game to get naked fastest? Is that why Moon plays like she does?
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:d.va,targetSaidMarker:d.va_high_score,totalExposed:1-2=bored,U-uhm. D.Va, it’s only the high score if you’re winning, right? I don’t really think... Er... Maybe you’re playing another game?
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:daria=embarrassed,(I'm kind of hoping I get to see it, she's been teasing herself for a while...)
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:dawn,targetStage:7=bored,I mean, most people already know they’re supposed to match... Mine does, obviously...
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elaine=excited,O-oh. W-well, this is a nice view, even if <i>I'm</i> not a fan of that style of underwear...
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elaine=excited,Y-you know, I have to say, I'm understanding the appeal of that kind of underwear...
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elaine=excited,At least it's not <i>entirely</i> up your butt, Elaine.
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elizabeth=alarmed,Wait I meant running! Oh no, you'll be doing both soon, argh! I'm so sorry!
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:felicia=embarrassed,I-I appreciate few yallowing--- You following the rules, Felicia, b-but it's just kind of... Not what I was expecting!
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen=embarrassed,What?
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri=embarrassed,E-er. I guess you really are from Korea!
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kimberly=embarrassed,Kimberly, I know we just met but... I've never seen tan lines on someone's... you know. I-I hope it doesn't cross a line if I look!
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyoko=embarrassed,I have a really bad feeling that you'd be a very strong supervillain... I-I think I should help you unwind before you get too stressed!
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu=embarrassed,Oh, here I was expecting some pink hair! N-not that I mind...
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:launch=alarmed,Launch matches... um... between sneezes... (She doesn't seem <i>too</i> akumatizable, just... irritated...)
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nagisa=wink,W-what, of course you’re cute!
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nagisa=embarrassed,A-as a friend, court you’re of yute! I- I’m. Er..
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:natsuki,alsoPlaying:monika,marker:trapsuki=alarmed,E-er, what is it you're implying about Natsuki, Monika...?
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:navi=embarrassed,Um, er, no, not, what you're-- about-- no, I mean, the literal--
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=embarrassed,I um. Think your friendship reminds me of Cat Noir and his kwami. They seem to argue a bit more than Tikki and I.
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=wink,Just keep a brave face, okay, Nayru?
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=embarrassed,Um. Yang, does Neo hate you, or… Like you?
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:palutena=embarrassed,D-did you mean to imply you drop them for other people? O-or mostly just yourself?
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:palutena,alsoPlaying:lyn=embarrassed,Well, two green haired women... Do your... You know... erm, match?
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=embarrassed,Um. Just less while naked.
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:red=excited,Or is it something like my earrings? <i>What?</i> Is your <i>sword</i> a Miraculous!?
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:saki=embarrassed,(I just feel a strong urge to protect her... Especially now...)
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:saki=embarrassed,(I feel such a strong need to protect Saki...)
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayaka=embarrassed,Um, Sayaka, I don't think I've ever faced an akuma like this before. Maybe witches are much scarier...
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayori=confident,O-oh, well, I wouldn't stare! But I think it's great you're happy with your appearance like this! I like to groom, but I think I get really self-conscious about how I look. I'm proud for you, Sayori!
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:scarlet_witch=excited,Oh my! That’s definitely magic I’ve never seen!
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:scarlet_witch,alsoPlaying:hermione=wink,Oh! So like how Hermione has been removing her small stuff. It’s… Interesting you saved it for last!
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=embarrassed,Um... is... all this talk about taking on water... a euphemism, Shimakaze? It's... very elaborate.
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola=embarrassed,Sola, I'm sorry that my original question about the matching is going to be answered... please don't hex me.
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight=confused,T-Twilight, usually that's something that comes off last!
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight=alarmed,W-wait everyone will be able to see your-
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight,alsoPlaying:nagisa=embarrassed,U-uh, Nagisa, shouldn't we tell Twilight not to...
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:uravity=wink,It must be super cool to be able to fly or float like you do!
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=bored,Or you could roll the die again. I really hope you're not just resetting your clothes...
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=bored,Just for your consideration: having good luck means <i>not</i> needing to rely on it...
7-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:blake,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=embarrassed,So, Blake… Um… Shaves… Her… Chat…
7-female_crotch_is_visible=excited,O-Oh, I like that style a lot. I think I’ll try it... at some point. T-the style. Not the  p-pussy.
7-female_crotch_is_visible,alsoPlaying:mulan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:duel_lost=wink,You mentioned a spirit guide… and you're from what seems to be Ancient China… do you know anything about the Miraculouses?
7-female_crotch_is_visible,alsoPlaying:sheena,alsoPlayingStage:8-10,notSaidMarker:hotsprings,marker:hotsprings=wink,Sheena, I have to admit a certain agreement… About exploring. For. Um. Adventuring purposes.
7-female_crotch_is_visible,totalExposed:2-4,saidMarker:bodysuit,count-bodysuit:2,count-bodysuit:3,count-bodysuit:4=alarmed,I-it just seems like a lot of work for not a lot of benefit… Does it really feel that much better?
7-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:ginger=excited,That’s so cool, ~name~! I bet you get complimented on it whenever you take off your underwear. Not that it happens a lot. Or if it did that’s your business? Either way, tres belle!
7-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=confident,Hmm. ~name~, I’m not usually a fan of the all natural look… Many people seem to like it, though!
7-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=embarrassed,Y-yikes, ~name~, how do you get it so...shiny?
7-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed=wink,Oh! That’s cute, ~name~. I-I mean, aesthetically!
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=confused,... Did you just... Climax... ?
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:alpha,marker:smooth_criminal=wink,Looks like you were struck by a <i>smooth</i> criminal.
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=alarmed,H-hey! You can't do that! No fair!
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:lyn=excited,See! It matches for people with non-typical hair colors too!
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:palutena=excited,See! It matches for people with non-typical hair colors too!
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ann=embarrassed,Oh. I see that it is. W-well! It adds a new element to your career! U-uhm. I mean, in modeling. Not this.
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:annie=wink,Tell me about it, Annie. There’s just not enough hours in the day… But I find that spending time in the shower to trim and groom. If you feel good, and look good, you can do your best!
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blackrose=embarrassed,Between your tattoos...and hue...and...um...even your cute little tangle… I-it might even entice a straight girl into doing… Um… you know…
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:yang,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=alarmed,O-oh I was expecting to say you had a… ah, fuzzy… B-but I guess this way you don’t get hair in each other’s mouths?
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy=embarrassed,I'm so sorry your clothes keep getting damaged. If um. You want, after this, I can loan you some of my stuff? Because we match! In... various ways!
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy,alsoPlaying:chun-li=embarrassed,Ow! I don't think I'd let a friend help me undress like that! (Yikes...)
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=alarmed,Goodness. Don't you fight a lot of battles? How on earth do you have time to maintain something like that?
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=confused,U-uhm. Corrin, with your ears, should I believe that all of your people look like that... or?
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:daria=bored,O-oh. Well, that trick again. I see. Well played, Daria.
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dawn=embarrassed,I-Eep. I’m going to stop talking now.
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elaine=alarmed,<i>C'est tout à fait le cul!</i>
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elaine=alarmed,Quite the tattoo, Elaine! You must've had it for a long time!
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=confident,W-well, I'm sure your partners will appreciate that, anyway...
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba=alarmed,I can't believe you didn't wear underwear!
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri=alarmed,U-uhm. Y-you're just very hairy! Most European girls I know um. Take care of that in other ways.
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:d.va,alsoPlayingStage:6-8,marker:korean_trends=embarrassed,Er... Hana, does yours... er... get that hairy when you don't shave? Or is Juri just out of touch with Korean beauty trends?
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kimberly=excited,I tend to prefer lots of sunblock, but that looks <i>super</i> cool, Kimberly! I'll have to try the look. We even... um, trim the same!
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyoko=alarmed,I-I'm not saying I'll, I just meant that you, I mean, uhm. Want to try on a Miraculous instead? Maybe... a spider, for making connections?
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu=calm,I definitely don’t like to take care of myself like that… But I will admit that look seems nice on you!
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:launch=embarrassed,W-well, that's... half of the question answered, I suppose.
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lilith=embarrassed,But your tattoos are cool! W-wait, you didn’t think I meant your... piercings or... your... uhm, patterning…
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lux=wink,It’s not supposed to match for blondes, is it? So that’s pretty normal. The contrast is pretty striking, given your light magic. Looks like you have a dark spot after all!
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,marker:unusual_blue_hair=bored,Er. I’m still not used to seeing women bare like this. It’s unusual to see blue hair in the first place so…
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=bored,Yikes. That looks rode hard and put away… um… Wet. I believe is the expression.
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=alarmed,You can climax just by… Thinking? Now <i>That’s</i> a superpower.
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nagisa=confident,Stay with it, Nagisa. If you don’t give up, you might lose, but you’re not defeated!
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki=wink,Just like my friend Alyx! She also has pink hair. And um, grooms like you do.
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:navi=alarmed,I'm really awkward about this, I can't think about you except how much you remind me of Tikki and it's so <i>weird</i>!
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=alarmed,E-er... I think it's okay to be excited. I-I mean, it's only natural. Not weird. O-or anything like that. S-so, just yenjoy ourself-- enjoy yourself, Nayru!
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=excited,Oh, what a relief! We have the same style--of um. You know! I think you must've just trimmed fresh today, though, <i>oui</i>?
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:palutena=alarmed,I-I suppose a memory is words a thousand worths. Worth a thousand words!
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:palutena,alsoPlaying:lyn=bored,Oh. Well, that’s one way of being unique.
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=confident,Maybe after this, you could show me some grappling stuff, huh, Mika?
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven=embarrassed,We’re both mixed women, we both fight evil, we both like bodysuits... We both don’t... shave our... er... nevermind.
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:red=wink,The Kwami inside seems to know you pretty well. It’s weird that you haven’t transformed yet, though.
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ruby=wink,Oh, I see at least the leader does what she wants.
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki=alarmed,W-wow, you sure are hairy, Saki! (Oh come on, Marinette!)
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki=alarmed,W-well, I think we all see you now, Saki! (Marinette, that's not what you should've said!)
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sayaka=alarmed,O-oh! You're... so hairy! I make sure to trim, most of the time, anyway... er... not that anyone needed to know that...
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:scarlet_witch=embarrassed,Well, that’s not true, my costume just vanishes when I run out of force...
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:scarlet_witch,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=confused,A-are you also going to use magic to do… Um… What she did?
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shimakaze=wink,W-well, less elaborate than how you groom, I suppose.
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola=alarmed,I said hex but if you wanted to... Sex... Uhm... I've... with a woman, never... ?
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:7=alarmed,W-wait, you removed your clothes instead of that hat and camera?
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight=alarmed,That’s definitely not human behavior! Are you a giant Kwami, or something else?
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity=alarmed,It makes your breasts look stunning too! Er, you look stunned, um… erk-- j-just keep at it, Ochako!
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:videl=confused,U-um. I think I have some questions about why you do that. You know. As a fighter.
7-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=confident,Looks like luck's still right where it belongs, Vriska. Here we go! One more hand!

-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,filter:huge_breasts,count-boob_envy:2=alarmed,Nope. Nope. I do not want anything to do with those. I am <i>very</i> happy with small breasts compared to those... <i>Gran tetons.</i>

-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,filter:freckles,priority:0=embarrassed,Aww, ~name~ has ladybug spots too! Just, more freckly and less costumey.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,filter:huge_breasts=embarrassed,E-erk? ~name~? W-w-whay!? I-I mean, w-what!?
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,filter:huge_breasts=alarmed,Y-yikes. D-do you ever worry about smothering people when you sleep with them!?

-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,filter:scarred,priority:0=bored,Oh ~name~... I'm sorry, whatever happened to you, I wish I could lucky charm it away...
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,filter:scarred,priority:0=bored,~name~, your scars look really cool, actually! I-I know that might not make them less... you know, personal. But they're part of you, and I think that's respectable.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:april,targetStage:3=excited,Donnie? Oh! You have someone special?
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=alarmed,Uh-hm. When I said I worked with another kitty, I did mean another person. N-not something else.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=embarrassed,Um... S-sorry Felicia, you look <i>vaguely</i> like someone I've spent a lot of time with... Just... Female and not dark.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena=excited,Oh! I wasn’t expecting...After the belts...Wow. I can see why the statues in your likeness have so many references to heavenly spheres.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena=embarrassed,Oh, don’t be so ashamed. We’re all here having fun, Palutena. There’s nothing wrong with nudity… Except the staring. And embarrassment. Okay, I’m sorry.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=wink,Um… I commend you for keeping the mask on, though. Is that for a secret identity, or just dedication to your craft?
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:shantae=alarmed,Maybe your dance is just so distracting that I dreamed the whole conversation up?
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:uravity=wink,No extra bug heroes yet! But it’s always great to meet new teammates!
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:uravity=embarrassed,Er, cat-themed you say? I think one cat-themed superhero is enough for my life.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:blake=alarmed,You know, I think I could do to meet new cat-themed superheroes… just to compare them to my Cat Noir. N-not <i>mine</i> mine, mind mew. Erk--
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:daria=wink,Somehow, I don't think Ochako could go for that. If it were just me, though, maybe that'd even be kinda fun... M-maybe.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:gwen=wink,I have a feeling I’ll be making a new teammate after this game, actually... I think she’s more arachnid themed, though!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=excited,I’m a little curious what you’re working with, ~name~.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,alsoPlayingStage:2,marker:ztentacles=embarrassed,I can imagine more fun things to do involving that than… I-I mean not personally but… Um…!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu,count-pink_hair:2=wink,I suppose the other pink-haired lady can show me if it can be natural or not!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:rwby=embarrassed,I heard a rumor from a friend that you all shave down there... Is that like, a bonding experience?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:thong,priority:0=bored,At least you'll be out of your thong, ~name~. That <i>can't</i> be comfortable.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:thong,priority:0=confused,I think thongs are just... super uncomfortable. But no panty lines... I think I'd have a bigger issue with that if not for my costume.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:thong,priority:0=alarmed,At least you don't have to wear your thong anymore, ~name~. How a day-long wedgie is at all comfortable is beyond me.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=alarmed,Y-you're really going to just? Wearing so little?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ann=alarmed,I-I mean if it is, that's great. People like to ask about mine a lot.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:blackrose=confident,Oh! Blackrose, I-I know it’s hard to lose but, hopefully whatever you have is particularly um...exotic?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:yang,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=alarmed,I know you aren’t a fan of… Um… Chat… Jokes, Blake…

-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:cammy,alsoPlaying:chun-li=alarmed,...! I-I...!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:d.va,targetSaidMarker:d.va_high_score,alsoPlaying:moon=confused,Wait, is the goal of this game to get naked fastest? Is that why Moon plays like she does?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:d.va,targetSaidMarker:d.va_high_score,totalExposed:1-2=bored,U-uhm. D.Va, it’s only the high score if you’re winning, right? I don’t really think... Er... Maybe you’re playing another game?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:daria=embarrassed,(I'm kind of hoping I get to see it, she's been teasing herself for a while...)
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:dawn,targetStage:7=bored,I mean, most people already know they’re supposed to match... Mine does, obviously...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elaine=excited,O-oh. W-well, this is a nice view, even if <i>I'm</i> not a fan of that style of underwear...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elaine=excited,Y-you know, I have to say, I'm understanding the appeal of that kind of underwear...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:elaine=excited,At least it's not <i>entirely</i> up your butt, Elaine.

-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:gwen=alarmed,You are so-so frustrated! Frustrating! Gah!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:juri=embarrassed,E-er. I guess you really are from Korea!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kimberly=embarrassed,Kimberly, I know we just met but... I've never seen tan lines on someone's... you know. I-I hope it doesn't cross a line if I look!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyoko=embarrassed,I have a really bad feeling that you'd be a very strong supervillain... I-I think I should help you unwind before you get too stressed!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu=embarrassed,Oh, here I was expecting some pink hair! N-not that I mind...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:launch=alarmed,Launch matches... um... between sneezes... (She doesn't seem <i>too</i> akumatizable, just... irritated...)
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nagisa=wink,W-what, of course you’re cute!

-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:navi=embarrassed,Um, er, no, not, what you're-- about-- no, I mean, the literal--
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=embarrassed,I um. Think your friendship reminds me of Cat Noir and his kwami. They seem to argue a bit more than Tikki and I.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=wink,Just keep a brave face, okay, Nayru?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=embarrassed,Um. Yang, does Neo hate you, or… Like you?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:palutena=embarrassed,D-did you mean to imply you drop them for other people? O-or mostly just yourself?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:palutena,alsoPlaying:lyn=embarrassed,Well, two green haired women... Do your... You know... erm, match?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=embarrassed,Um. Just less while naked.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:red=excited,Or is it something like my earrings? <i>What?</i> Is your <i>sword</i> a Miraculous!?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:saki=embarrassed,(I just feel a strong urge to protect her... Especially now...)
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:saki=embarrassed,(I feel such a strong need to protect Saki...)
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayaka=embarrassed,Um, Sayaka, I don't think I've ever faced an akuma like this before. Maybe witches are much scarier...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayori=confident,O-oh, well, I wouldn't stare! But I think it's great you're happy with your appearance like this! I like to groom, but I think I get really self-conscious about how I look. I'm proud for you, Sayori!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:scarlet_witch=excited,Oh my! That’s definitely magic I’ve never seen!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:scarlet_witch,alsoPlaying:hermione=wink,Oh! So like how Hermione has been removing her small stuff. It’s… Interesting you saved it for last!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=embarrassed,Um... is... all this talk about taking on water... a euphemism, Shimakaze? It's... very elaborate.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola=embarrassed,Sola, I'm sorry that my original question about the matching is going to be answered... please don't hex me.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:tracer=wink,Maybe you should zip over here and help me finish?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight=confused,T-Twilight, usually that's something that comes off last!

-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:uravity=wink,It must be super cool to be able to fly or float like you do!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=bored,Or you could roll the die again. I really hope you're not just resetting your clothes...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=bored,Just for your consideration: having good luck means <i>not</i> needing to rely on it...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:blake,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=embarrassed,So, Blake… Um… Shaves… Her… Chat…
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,totalExposed:2-4,saidMarker:bodysuit=wink,Er… ~name~, do you shave under there? Given that everyone else here in a bodysuit seems to, maybe I should see how it feels?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible=alarmed,O-Oh, I like that style a lot. I think I’ll try it... at some point. T-the style. Not the  p-pussy.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,alsoPlaying:mulan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:duel_lost=wink,You mentioned a spirit guide… and you're from what seems to be Ancient China… do you know anything about the Miraculouses?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,alsoPlaying:sheena,alsoPlayingStage:8-10,notSaidMarker:hotsprings,marker:hotsprings=wink,Sheena, I have to admit a certain agreement… About exploring. For. Um. Adventuring purposes.

-3-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=confident,Hmm. ~name~, I’m not usually a fan of the all natural look… Many people seem to like it, though!

-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:lyn=excited,See! It matches for people with non-typical hair colors too!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:palutena=excited,See! It matches for people with non-typical hair colors too!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ann=embarrassed,Oh. I see that it is. W-well! It adds a new element to your career! U-uhm. I mean, in modeling. Not this.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:annie=wink,Tell me about it, Annie. There’s just not enough hours in the day… But I find that spending time in the shower to trim and groom. If you feel good, and look good, you can do your best!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blackrose=embarrassed,Between your tattoos...and hue...and...um...even your cute little tangle… I-it might even entice a straight girl into doing… Um… you know…
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:yang,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=alarmed,O-oh I was expecting to say you had a… ah, fuzzy… B-but I guess this way you don’t get hair in each other’s mouths?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy=embarrassed,I'm so sorry your clothes keep getting damaged. If um. You want, after this, I can loan you some of my stuff? Because we match! In... various ways!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy,alsoPlaying:chun-li=embarrassed,Ow! I don't think I'd let a friend help me undress like that! (Yikes...)
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=alarmed,Goodness. Don't you fight a lot of battles? How on earth do you have time to maintain something like that?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=confused,U-uhm. Corrin, with your ears, should I believe that all of your people look like that... or?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:daria=bored,O-oh. Well, that trick again. I see. Well played, Daria.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dawn=embarrassed,I-Eep. I’m going to stop talking now.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elaine=alarmed,<i>C'est tout à fait le cul!</i>

-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=confident,W-well, I'm sure your partners will appreciate that, anyway...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba=alarmed,I can't believe you didn't wear underwear!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:gwen=wink,Somehow, I think you’re doing this just to push my buttons.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri=alarmed,U-uhm. Y-you're just very hairy! Most European girls I know um. Take care of that in other ways.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:d.va,alsoPlayingStage:6-8,marker:korean_trends=embarrassed,Er... Hana, does yours... er... get that hairy when you don't shave? Or is Juri just out of touch with Korean beauty trends?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kimberly=excited,I tend to prefer lots of sunblock, but that looks <i>super</i> cool, Kimberly! I'll have to try the look. We even... um, trim the same!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyoko=alarmed,I-I'm not saying I'll, I just meant that you, I mean, uhm. Want to try on a Miraculous instead? Maybe... a spider, for making connections?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu=calm,I definitely don’t like to take care of myself like that… But I will admit that look seems nice on you!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:launch=embarrassed,W-well, that's... half of the question answered, I suppose.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lilith=embarrassed,But your tattoos are cool! W-wait, you didn’t think I meant your... piercings or... your... uhm, patterning…
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lux=wink,It’s not supposed to match for blondes, is it? So that’s pretty normal. The contrast is pretty striking, given your light magic. Looks like you have a dark spot after all!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,marker:unusual_blue_hair=bored,Er. I’m still not used to seeing women bare like this. It’s unusual to see blue hair in the first place so…
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=bored,Yikes. That looks rode hard and put away… um… Wet. I believe is the expression.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=alarmed,You can climax just by… Thinking? Now <i>That’s</i> a superpower.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nagisa=confident,Stay with it, Nagisa. If you don’t give up, you might lose, but you’re not defeated!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki=wink,Just like my friend Alyx! She also has pink hair. And um, grooms like you do.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:navi=alarmed,I'm really awkward about this, I can't think about you except how much you remind me of Tikki and it's so <i>weird</i>!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=alarmed,E-er... I think it's okay to be excited. I-I mean, it's only natural. Not weird. O-or anything like that. S-so, just yenjoy ourself-- enjoy yourself, Nayru!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=embarrassed,Oh, what a relief! We have the same style! I think you must've just trimmed fresh today, though, <i>oui</i>? N-not that you need to answer that. I mean, I didn't do mine just today. Er... I'll stop now.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:palutena=alarmed,I-I suppose a memory is words a thousand worths. Worth a thousand words!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:palutena,alsoPlaying:lyn=bored,Oh. Well, that’s one way of being unique.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=confident,Maybe after this, you could show me some grappling stuff, huh, Mika?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven=embarrassed,We’re both mixed women, we both fight evil, we both like bodysuits... We both don’t... shave our... er... nevermind.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:red=wink,The Kwami inside seems to know you pretty well. It’s weird that you haven’t transformed yet, though.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ruby=wink,Oh, I see at least the leader does what she wants.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki=alarmed,W-wow, you sure are hairy, Saki! (Oh come on, Marinette!)
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki=alarmed,W-well, I think we all see you now, Saki! (Marinette, that's not what you should've said!)
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sayaka=wink,O-oh! You're... so hairy! I make sure to trim, most of the time, anyway. I guess being a magical girl professionally really keeps you busy!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:scarlet_witch=embarrassed,Well, that’s not true, my costume just vanishes when I run out of force...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:scarlet_witch,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=confused,A-are you also going to use magic to do… Um… What she did?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shimakaze=wink,W-well, less elaborate than how you groom, I suppose.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola=alarmed,I said hex but if you wanted to... Sex... Uhm... I've... with a woman, never... ?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:7=alarmed,W-wait, you removed your clothes instead of that hat and camera?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight=alarmed,That’s definitely not human behavior! Are you a giant Kwami, or something else?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity=alarmed,It makes your breasts look stunning too! Er, you look stunned, um… erk-- j-just keep at it, Ochako!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:videl=confused,U-um. I think I have some questions about why you do that. You know. As a fighter.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=confident,Looks like luck's still right where it belongs, Vriska. Here we go! One more hand!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:blake,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=alarmed,D-does that make it easier for you two to… You know? Soixante neuf?

-2-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:shego,alsoPlaying:kim=calm,J-just surrender to us, not Hawk Moth. Just because Kim and I are having a crossover doesn't mean our villains need to...
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible=wink,My goodness, I’d be jealous if it weren’t right in front of me...
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:angie,notSaidMarker:angie_boobs,marker:angie_boobs=wink,You know, Angie, it's okay to like breasts. No need to be embarrassed.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,filter:huge_breasts,count-boob_envy:2=alarmed,Nope. Nope. I do not want anything to do with those. I am <i>very</i> happy with small breasts compared to those... <i>Gran tetons.</i>

-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=wink,Um… I commend you for keeping the mask on, though. Is that for a secret identity, or just dedication to your craft?
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:shantae=alarmed,Maybe your dance is just so distracting that I dreamed the whole conversation up?

-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:uravity=embarrassed,Er, cat-themed you say? I think one cat-themed superhero is enough for my life.
-2-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:blake=alarmed,You know, I think I could do to meet new cat-themed superheroes… just to compare them to my Cat Noir. N-not <i>mine</i> mine, mind mew. Erk--

-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:thong,priority:0=bored,At least you'll be out of your thong, ~name~. That <i>can't</i> be comfortable.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:thong,priority:0=confused,I think thongs are just... super uncomfortable. But no panty lines... I think I'd have a bigger issue with that if not for my costume.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:thong,priority:0=alarmed,At least you don't have to wear your thong anymore, ~name~. How a day-long wedgie is at all comfortable is beyond me.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=alarmed,Y-you're really going to just? Wearing so little?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ann=alarmed,I-I mean if it is, that's great. People like to ask about mine a lot.

-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:d.va,targetSaidMarker:d.va_high_score,alsoPlaying:moon=confused,Wait, is the goal of this game to get naked fastest? Is that why Moon plays like she does?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:d.va,targetSaidMarker:d.va_high_score,totalExposed:1-2=bored,U-uhm. D.Va, it’s only the high score if you’re winning, right? I don’t really think... Er... Maybe you’re playing another game?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:daria=embarrassed,(I'm kind of hoping I get to see it, she's been teasing herself for a while...)

-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyoko=embarrassed,I have a really bad feeling that you'd be a very strong supervillain... I-I think I should help you unwind before you get too stressed!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu=embarrassed,Oh, here I was expecting some pink hair! N-not that I mind...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:launch=alarmed,Launch matches... um... between sneezes... (She doesn't seem <i>too</i> akumatizable, just... irritated...)

-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=embarrassed,I um. Think your friendship reminds me of Cat Noir and his kwami. They seem to argue a bit more than Tikki and I.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=wink,Just keep a brave face, okay, Nayru?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=embarrassed,Um. Yang, does Neo hate you, or… Like you?
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:palutena=embarrassed,D-did you mean to imply you drop them for other people? O-or mostly just yourself?

-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=embarrassed,Um. Just less while naked.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:red=excited,Or is it something like my earrings? <i>What?</i> Is your <i>sword</i> a Miraculous!?

-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayaka=embarrassed,Um, Sayaka, I don't think I've ever faced an akuma like this before. Maybe witches are much scarier...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayori=confident,O-oh, well, I wouldn't stare! But I think it's great you're happy with your appearance like this! I like to groom, but I think I get really self-conscious about how I look. I'm proud for you, Sayori!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:scarlet_witch=excited,Oh my! That’s definitely magic I’ve never seen!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:scarlet_witch,alsoPlaying:hermione=wink,Oh! So like how Hermione has been removing her small stuff. It’s… Interesting you saved it for last!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=embarrassed,Um... is... all this talk about taking on water... a euphemism, Shimakaze? It's... very elaborate.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola=embarrassed,Sola, I'm sorry that my original question about the matching is going to be answered... please don't hex me.
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight=confused,T-Twilight, usually that's something that comes off last!

-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:uravity=wink,It must be super cool to be able to fly or float like you do!
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=bored,Or you could roll the die again. I really hope you're not just resetting your clothes...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=bored,Just for your consideration: having good luck means <i>not</i> needing to rely on it...
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:blake,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=embarrassed,So, Blake… Um… Shaves… Her… Chat…
-2-female_crotch_will_be_visible,totalExposed:2-4,saidMarker:bodysuit=wink,Er… ~name~, do you shave under there? Given that everyone else here in a bodysuit seems to, maybe I should see how it feels?

-2-female_crotch_is_visible=embarrassed,You’re soaked... c-could I get a touch?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,alsoPlaying:mulan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:duel_lost=wink,You mentioned a spirit guide… and you're from what seems to be Ancient China… do you know anything about the Miraculouses?

-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:lyn=excited,See! It matches for people with non-typical hair colors too!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:palutena=excited,See! It matches for people with non-typical hair colors too!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ann=embarrassed,Oh. I see that it is. W-well! It adds a new element to your career! U-uhm. I mean, in modeling. Not this.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:annie=wink,Tell me about it, Annie. There’s just not enough hours in the day… But I find that spending time in the shower to trim and groom. If you feel good, and look good, you can do your best!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blackrose=embarrassed,Between your tattoos...and hue...and...um...even your cute little tangle… I-it might even entice a straight girl into doing… Um… you know…
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:yang,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=alarmed,O-oh I was expecting to say you had a… ah, fuzzy… B-but I guess this way you don’t get hair in each other’s mouths?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy=embarrassed,I'm so sorry your clothes keep getting damaged. If um. You want, after this, I can loan you some of my stuff? Because we match! In... various ways!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy,alsoPlaying:chun-li=embarrassed,Ow! I don't think I'd let a friend help me undress like that! (Yikes...)
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=alarmed,Goodness. Don't you fight a lot of battles? How on earth do you have time to maintain something like that?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=confused,U-uhm. Corrin, with your ears, should I believe that all of your people look like that... or?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:daria=bored,O-oh. Well, that trick again. I see. Well played, Daria.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dawn=embarrassed,I-Eep. I’m going to stop talking now.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elaine=alarmed,<i>C'est tout à fait le cul!</i>
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elaine=alarmed,Quite the tattoo, Elaine! You must've had it for a long time!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=confident,W-well, I'm sure your partners will appreciate that, anyway...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba=alarmed,I can't believe you didn't wear underwear!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:gwen=wink,Somehow, I think you’re doing this just to push my buttons.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri=alarmed,U-uhm. Y-you're just very hairy! Most European girls I know um. Take care of that in other ways.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:d.va,alsoPlayingStage:6-8,marker:korean_trends=embarrassed,Er... Hana, does yours... er... get that hairy when you don't shave? Or is Juri just out of touch with Korean beauty trends?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kimberly=excited,I tend to prefer lots of sunblock, but that looks <i>super</i> cool, Kimberly! I'll have to try the look. We even... um, trim the same!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyoko=alarmed,I-I'm not saying I'll, I just meant that you, I mean, uhm. Want to try on a Miraculous instead? Maybe... a spider, for making connections?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu=calm,I definitely don’t like to take care of myself like that… But I will admit that look seems nice on you!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:launch=embarrassed,W-well, that's... half of the question answered, I suppose.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lilith=embarrassed,But your tattoos are cool! W-wait, you didn’t think I meant your... piercings or... your... uhm, patterning…
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lux=wink,It’s not supposed to match for blondes, is it? So that’s pretty normal. The contrast is pretty striking, given your light magic. Looks like you have a dark spot after all!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,marker:unusual_blue_hair=bored,Er. I’m still not used to seeing women bare like this. It’s unusual to see blue hair in the first place so…
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=bored,Yikes. That looks rode hard and put away… um… Wet. I believe is the expression.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=alarmed,You can climax just by… Thinking? Now <i>That’s</i> a superpower.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nagisa=confident,Stay with it, Nagisa. If you don’t give up, you might lose, but you’re not defeated!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki=wink,Just like my friend Alyx! She also has pink hair. And um, grooms like you do.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:navi=alarmed,I'm really awkward about this, I can't think about you except how much you remind me of Tikki and it's so <i>weird</i>!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=alarmed,E-er... I think it's okay to be excited. I-I mean, it's only natural. Not weird. O-or anything like that. S-so, just yenjoy ourself-- enjoy yourself, Nayru!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=embarrassed,Oh, what a relief! We have the same style! I think you must've just trimmed fresh today, though, <i>oui</i>? N-not that you need to answer that. I mean, I didn't do mine just today. Er... I'll stop now.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:palutena=alarmed,I-I suppose a memory is words a thousand worths. Worth a thousand words!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:palutena,alsoPlaying:lyn=bored,Oh. Well, that’s one way of being unique.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=confident,Maybe after this, you could show me some grappling stuff, huh, Mika?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven=embarrassed,We’re both mixed women, we both fight evil, we both like bodysuits... We both don’t... shave our... er... nevermind.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:red=wink,The Kwami inside seems to know you pretty well. It’s weird that you haven’t transformed yet, though.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ruby=wink,Oh, I see at least the leader does what she wants.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki=alarmed,W-wow, you sure are hairy, Saki! (Oh come on, Marinette!)
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki=alarmed,W-well, I think we all see you now, Saki! (Marinette, that's not what you should've said!)
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sayaka=wink,O-oh! You're... so hairy! I make sure to trim, most of the time, anyway. I guess being a magical girl professionally really keeps you busy!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:scarlet_witch=embarrassed,Well, that’s not true, my costume just vanishes when I run out of force...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:scarlet_witch,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=confused,A-are you also going to use magic to do… Um… What she did?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shimakaze=wink,W-well, less elaborate than how you groom, I suppose.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola=alarmed,I said hex but if you wanted to... Sex... Uhm... I've... with a woman, never... ?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:7=alarmed,W-wait, you removed your clothes instead of that hat and camera?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight=alarmed,That’s definitely not human behavior! Are you a giant Kwami, or something else?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity=alarmed,It makes your breasts look stunning too! Er, you look stunned, um… erk-- j-just keep at it, Ochako!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:videl=confused,U-um. I think I have some questions about why you do that. You know. As a fighter.
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=wink,W-well, you g-get to see me, s-so, really, luck isn't on <i>either</i> of our sides...
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=wink,M-maybe luck is on <i>both</i> of our sides... This is eartinly chexiting... certainly exciting!
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:blake,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=alarmed,D-does that make it easier for you two to… You know? Soixante neuf?
-2-female_crotch_is_visible,totalExposed:2-4,saidMarker:bodysuit=excited,Unf. Okay. I can see the appeal of that.

-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nagisa,marker:battlecry_nagisa=confident,That’s impressive, I mean! You have such a good figure, Nagisa!
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nagisa,saidMarker:marinette_ricebun=alarmed,You’re bigger than I expected! This is like biting into a bun and finding a rice cracker!
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=confused,Well... this is odd, but I suppose if Nayru was okay with it, I can be too... I'd never <i>ever</i> let someone else do this to me though...
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=calm,If it makes you feel better, Nayru, maybe you could just consider me your friend? I mean, this was <i>quite</i> a get-to-know-you.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:saki,saidMarker:saki_date=embarrassed,Um... S-sorry if matchmaking was a bit... rude of me, all things considered... I just figured you'd look cute together...
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:saki,saidMarker:saki_date=embarrassed,Um! Saki looks way cuter than she thinks she does, right? Um. ~player~? (I think she looks pretty!)
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:saki,targetStage:6,notSaidMarker:saki_date=confident,W-well, up to you, Saki! Consider it a... um... reward! For seeing this through!
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sanako=confused,I-I'm not sure if I should flirt or ask you to help me with my homework. This is such an uncanny feeling...
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sayaka=alarmed,Gah! That's not supposed to be a surprise!! At-at least I put on clothes this morning before adventuring... I've... um similarly been embarrassed.

-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:shazza=alarmed,Er, my timing seems to be off... like your top, though.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:shego,alsoPlaying:kim=calm,J-just surrender to us, not Hawk Moth. Just because Kim and I are having a crossover doesn't mean our villains need to...
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible=calm,I'm happy with my breasts, but yours are definitely special too!
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,alsoPlaying:angie,notSaidMarker:angie_boobs,marker:angie_boobs=wink,You know, Angie, it's okay to like breasts. No need to be embarrassed.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,filter:huge_breasts,count-boob_envy:2=alarmed,Nope. Nope. I do not want anything to do with those. I am <i>very</i> happy with small breasts compared to those... <i>Gran tetons.</i>

-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,filter:scarred,priority:0=bored,~name~, your scars look really cool, actually! I-I know that might not make them less... you know, personal. But they're part of you, and I think that's respectable.

-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:felicia=embarrassed,Um... S-sorry Felicia, you look <i>vaguely</i> like someone I've spent a lot of time with... Just... Female and not dark.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena=excited,Oh! I wasn’t expecting...After the belts...Wow. I can see why the statues in your likeness have so many references to heavenly spheres.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena=embarrassed,Oh, don’t be so ashamed. We’re all here having fun, Palutena. There’s nothing wrong with nudity… Except the staring. And embarrassment. Okay, I’m sorry.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=wink,Um… I commend you for keeping the mask on, though. Is that for a secret identity, or just dedication to your craft?
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:shantae=alarmed,Maybe your dance is just so distracting that I dreamed the whole conversation up?
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:uravity=wink,No extra bug heroes yet! But it’s always great to meet new teammates!
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:uravity=embarrassed,Er, cat-themed you say? I think one cat-themed superhero is enough for my life.
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:uravity,alsoPlaying:blake=alarmed,You know, I think I could do to meet new cat-themed superheroes… just to compare them to my Cat Noir. N-not <i>mine</i> mine, mind mew. Erk--

-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:thong,priority:0=bored,At least you'll be out of your thong, ~name~. That <i>can't</i> be comfortable.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:thong,priority:0=confused,I think thongs are just... super uncomfortable. But no panty lines... I think I'd have a bigger issue with that if not for my costume.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,filter:thong,priority:0=alarmed,At least you don't have to wear your thong anymore, ~name~. How a day-long wedgie is at all comfortable is beyond me.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=alarmed,Y-you're really going to just? Wearing so little?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:ann=alarmed,I-I mean if it is, that's great. People like to ask about mine a lot.

-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:d.va,targetSaidMarker:d.va_high_score,alsoPlaying:moon=confused,Wait, is the goal of this game to get naked fastest? Is that why Moon plays like she does?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:d.va,targetSaidMarker:d.va_high_score,totalExposed:1-2=bored,U-uhm. D.Va, it’s only the high score if you’re winning, right? I don’t really think... Er... Maybe you’re playing another game?

-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kimberly=embarrassed,Kimberly, I know we just met but... I've never seen tan lines on someone's... you know. I-I hope it doesn't cross a line if I look!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyoko=embarrassed,I have a really bad feeling that you'd be a very strong supervillain... I-I think I should help you unwind before you get too stressed!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:kyu=embarrassed,Oh, here I was expecting some pink hair! N-not that I mind...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:launch=alarmed,Launch matches... um... between sneezes... (She doesn't seem <i>too</i> akumatizable, just... irritated...)
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nagisa=wink,W-what, of course you’re cute!

-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:navi=embarrassed,Um, er, no, not, what you're-- about-- no, I mean, the literal--
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=embarrassed,I um. Think your friendship reminds me of Cat Noir and his kwami. They seem to argue a bit more than Tikki and I.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=wink,Just keep a brave face, okay, Nayru?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:neo,alsoPlaying:yang,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=embarrassed,Um. Yang, does Neo hate you, or… Like you?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:palutena=embarrassed,D-did you mean to imply you drop them for other people? O-or mostly just yourself?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:palutena,alsoPlaying:lyn=embarrassed,Well, two green haired women... Do your... You know... erm, match?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:rainbow_mika=embarrassed,Um. Just less while naked.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:red=excited,Or is it something like my earrings? <i>What?</i> Is your <i>sword</i> a Miraculous!?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:saki=embarrassed,(I just feel a strong urge to protect her... Especially now...)
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:saki=embarrassed,(I feel such a strong need to protect Saki...)
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayaka=embarrassed,Um, Sayaka, I don't think I've ever faced an akuma like this before. Maybe witches are much scarier...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sayori=confident,O-oh, well, I wouldn't stare! But I think it's great you're happy with your appearance like this! I like to groom, but I think I get really self-conscious about how I look. I'm proud for you, Sayori!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:scarlet_witch=excited,Oh my! That’s definitely magic I’ve never seen!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:scarlet_witch,alsoPlaying:hermione=wink,Oh! So like how Hermione has been removing her small stuff. It’s… Interesting you saved it for last!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:shimakaze=embarrassed,Um... is... all this talk about taking on water... a euphemism, Shimakaze? It's... very elaborate.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:sola=embarrassed,Sola, I'm sorry that my original question about the matching is going to be answered... please don't hex me.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight=confused,T-Twilight, usually that's something that comes off last!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight=alarmed,W-wait everyone will be able to see your-

-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:uravity=wink,It must be super cool to be able to fly or float like you do!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=bored,Or you could roll the die again. I really hope you're not just resetting your clothes...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:vriska=bored,Just for your consideration: having good luck means <i>not</i> needing to rely on it...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:blake,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=embarrassed,So, Blake… Um… Shaves… Her… Chat…
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,totalExposed:2-4,saidMarker:bodysuit=wink,Er… ~name~, do you shave under there? Given that everyone else here in a bodysuit seems to, maybe I should see how it feels?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible=excited,Hmm, that's not what I imagined when I was playing with myself.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,alsoPlaying:mulan,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:duel_lost=wink,You mentioned a spirit guide… and you're from what seems to be Ancient China… do you know anything about the Miraculouses?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,alsoPlaying:sheena,alsoPlayingStage:8-10,notSaidMarker:hotsprings,marker:hotsprings=wink,Sheena, I have to admit a certain agreement… About exploring. For. Um. Adventuring purposes.

-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=confident,Mmf. I wouldn’t mind running my fingers in that, i-if I were honest.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:shaved=embarrassed,Ouch. T-though I would… Rather not do that myself, c-could I see how that feels? W-with my… fingers, of course!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:trimmed=wink,Yes! How do you maintain that, ~name~? It looks really classy! I would know!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=confused,... Did you just... Climax... ?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:alpha,marker:smooth_criminal=wink,Looks like you were struck by a <i>smooth</i> criminal.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:5=alarmed,H-hey! You can't do that! No fair!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:lyn=excited,See! It matches for people with non-typical hair colors too!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:amalia,targetStage:7,alsoPlaying:palutena=excited,See! It matches for people with non-typical hair colors too!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ann=embarrassed,Oh. I see that it is. W-well! It adds a new element to your career! U-uhm. I mean, in modeling. Not this.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:annie=wink,Tell me about it, Annie. There’s just not enough hours in the day… But I find that spending time in the shower to trim and groom. If you feel good, and look good, you can do your best!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blackrose=embarrassed,Between your tattoos...and hue...and...um...even your cute little tangle… I-it might even entice a straight girl into doing… Um… you know…
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:blake,alsoPlaying:yang,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=alarmed,O-oh I was expecting to say you had a… ah, fuzzy… B-but I guess this way you don’t get hair in each other’s mouths?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy=embarrassed,I'm so sorry your clothes keep getting damaged. If um. You want, after this, I can loan you some of my stuff? Because we match! In... various ways!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy,alsoPlaying:chun-li=embarrassed,Ow! I don't think I'd let a friend help me undress like that! (Yikes...)
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=alarmed,Goodness. Don't you fight a lot of battles? How on earth do you have time to maintain something like that?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:corrin_f=confused,U-uhm. Corrin, with your ears, should I believe that all of your people look like that... or?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:daria=bored,O-oh. Well, that trick again. I see. Well played, Daria.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:dawn=embarrassed,I-Eep. I’m going to stop talking now.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elaine=alarmed,<i>C'est tout à fait le cul!</i>
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elaine=alarmed,Quite the tattoo, Elaine! You must've had it for a long time!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=confident,W-well, I'm sure your partners will appreciate that, anyway...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:futaba=alarmed,I can't believe you didn't wear underwear!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:gwen=wink,Somehow, I think you’re doing this just to push my buttons.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri=alarmed,U-uhm. Y-you're just very hairy! Most European girls I know um. Take care of that in other ways.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:juri,alsoPlaying:d.va,alsoPlayingStage:6-8,marker:korean_trends=embarrassed,Er... Hana, does yours... er... get that hairy when you don't shave? Or is Juri just out of touch with Korean beauty trends?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kimberly=excited,I tend to prefer lots of sunblock, but that looks <i>super</i> cool, Kimberly! I'll have to try the look. We even... um, trim the same!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyoko=alarmed,I-I'm not saying I'll, I just meant that you, I mean, uhm. Want to try on a Miraculous instead? Maybe... a spider, for making connections?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:kyu=calm,I definitely don’t like to take care of myself like that… But I will admit that look seems nice on you!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:launch=embarrassed,W-well, that's... half of the question answered, I suppose.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lilith=embarrassed,But your tattoos are cool! W-wait, you didn’t think I meant your... piercings or... your... uhm, patterning…
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:lux=wink,It’s not supposed to match for blondes, is it? So that’s pretty normal. The contrast is pretty striking, given your light magic. Looks like you have a dark spot after all!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:meia,marker:unusual_blue_hair=bored,Er. I’m still not used to seeing women bare like this. It’s unusual to see blue hair in the first place so…
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=bored,Yikes. That looks rode hard and put away… um… Wet. I believe is the expression.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=alarmed,You can climax just by… Thinking? Now <i>That’s</i> a superpower.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nagisa=confident,Stay with it, Nagisa. If you don’t give up, you might lose, but you’re not defeated!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:natsuki=wink,Just like my friend Alyx! She also has pink hair. And um, grooms like you do.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:navi=alarmed,I'm really awkward about this, I can't think about you except how much you remind me of Tikki and it's so <i>weird</i>!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru,targetNotSaidMarker:null_possess=alarmed,E-er... I think it's okay to be excited. I-I mean, it's only natural. Not weird. O-or anything like that. S-so, just yenjoy ourself-- enjoy yourself, Nayru!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru,targetSaidMarker:null_possess=embarrassed,Oh, what a relief! We have the same style! I think you must've just trimmed fresh today, though, <i>oui</i>? N-not that you need to answer that. I mean, I didn't do mine just today. Er... I'll stop now.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:palutena=alarmed,I-I suppose a memory is words a thousand worths. Worth a thousand words!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:palutena,alsoPlaying:lyn=bored,Oh. Well, that’s one way of being unique.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:rainbow_mika=confident,Maybe after this, you could show me some grappling stuff, huh, Mika?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:raven=embarrassed,We’re both mixed women, we both fight evil, we both like bodysuits... We both don’t... shave our... er... nevermind.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:red=wink,The Kwami inside seems to know you pretty well. It’s weird that you haven’t transformed yet, though.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ruby=wink,Oh, I see at least the leader does what she wants.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki=alarmed,W-wow, you sure are hairy, Saki! (Oh come on, Marinette!)
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:saki=alarmed,W-well, I think we all see you now, Saki! (Marinette, that's not what you should've said!)
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sayaka=wink,O-oh! You're... so hairy! I make sure to trim, most of the time, anyway. I guess being a magical girl professionally really keeps you busy!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:scarlet_witch=embarrassed,Well, that’s not true, my costume just vanishes when I run out of force…
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:scarlet_witch,alsoPlaying:hermione,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=confused,A-are you also going to use magic to do… Um… What she did?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:shimakaze=wink,W-well, less elaborate than how you groom, I suppose.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:sola=alarmed,I said hex but if you wanted to... Sex... Uhm... I've... with a woman, never... ?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:7=alarmed,W-wait, you removed your clothes instead of that hat and camera?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:twilight=alarmed,That’s definitely not human behavior! Are you a giant Kwami, or something else?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:uravity=alarmed,It makes your breasts look stunning too! Er, you look stunned, um… erk-- j-just keep at it, Ochako!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:videl=confused,U-um. I think I have some questions about why you do that. You know. As a fighter.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=wink,W-well, you g-get to see me, s-so, really, luck isn't on <i>either</i> of our sides...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:vriska=wink,M-maybe luck is on <i>both</i> of our sides... This is eartinly chexiting... certainly exciting!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:yang,alsoPlaying:blake,alsoPlayingStage:8-10=alarmed,D-does that make it easier for you two to… You know? Soixante neuf?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,totalExposed:2-4,saidMarker:bodysuit=excited,Unf. Okay. I can see the appeal of that.

#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.
