    <othernotes>Overview &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Eichi is 19 years old and a recent graduate of a high school focused on training idols called Yumenosaki Academy. He’s now working full time as an idol and as a business executive for Starmaker Production (Which is one of the idol agencies under an entertainment company called Ensemble Square)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Pretty severely chronically ill and has a shortened lifespan. Talk about death will rarely ever faze him and whenever he mentions his conditions he’s very lighthearted about them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Comes from an extremely wealthy family and may be unaware of certain “commoner” things.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- His personality is mostly playful and mellow. He likes teasing people but mostly to get a rise out of them. Otherwise Eichi’s behavior is very polite and proper, and while he’ll be flirty with people who catch his eye, he keeps it classy..&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- …until he becomes increasingly excited as the game progresses. From about stage 4 and onwards, his flirting becomes increasingly lewd and blatant. He’s a not-so-closet freak. Though even when he’s making more aggressive passes, he’s not exactly forceful.&lt;br&gt;Background&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Enstars lore is INCREDIBLY complicated, believe it or not. So information in this section will be kept to non-spoiler basics (You won’t need to know much more to get a feel for his character, anyway.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- He has always dreamed of being an idol, prompted by idol media being his only comfort when he was hospitalized and alone. At his core, Eichi’s wishes are just to bring people smiles and comfort like other idols did for him, but the way he goes about his goals can be extremely ruthless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- During his time at the idol training school, upon noticing the academy’s reputation was crashing and the idols there weren’t living up to his ideal, he orchestrated a plan as he became student council president, and handpicked the most succesful idols in the school to take down with his newly formed unit and sabotage, with the intention of “showing others that they can surpass anyone if they try hard enough”, something along these lines.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- These events caused a lot of emotional damage to the people involved and Eichi knows about it. He feel deep guilt for the way everything happened, but looks past it in favor of continuing to work for an idol industry that’s as good as it can be. He has a very ends justifies the means type of mindset.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- After graduating, his ruthless tendencies have mellowed out, and tensions between his and other idol groups vaguely lowered, but he’s still very much the type who’s not afraid to get rid of anything that he perceives as being in his way. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- (With all of that being said, though, this will most likely not come up in SPNATI. But in a few occasions, his ruthless streak may show through.)&lt;br&gt;Things you may want to target&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- He’ll refer to every japanese characters with the honorifics “he sees as appropriate” for them. Sometimes he will seem overly familiar. This is done entirely on purpose in his part, either to get a rise from the person, and/or because he finds them endearing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Some non-japanese characters will be referred to with titles, such as Miss/Mr/Dr. This can indicate both general respect/interest and distance (Mostly in the case of doctor-looking characters, who he’ll be a bit put off by at first, but will eventually become more comfortable around, or even interested in them, depending on who it is.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- He’s very famous and shouldn’t be in the Inventory for the sake of his reputation. Despite that, he’s a regular there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Will engage in some bratty teasing with serious/mean characters. Not necessarily sexually, but it can become more suggestive as the rounds go on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Excited by armed/aggressive characters. Very real danger kink. Exploit this to your heart’s content if you wish.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Excited by when people flirt back with him too, the more aggressively they do it, the better. He’s difficult to fluster, but it’s not impossible. Eichi is used to be seen as someone who’s either too fragile or too important to approach– so reverting his expectations will always get his interest.</othernotes>
