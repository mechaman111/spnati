        <text>Pragmatically, Mei knew the odds of her winning the game and leaving unstimulated were low. She had made suitable preparations and went back to her base with a fresh pair of undershorts. However, she neglected to collect her old undershorts. Hold on to them and maybe you can return them to her when you next convene.</text>
        <unlock>Win a game against Mei.</unlock>
