    <othernotes>Some character notes:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- A little dim witted, but not overly stupid – she makes bad decisions due to impulsiveness. For one, she's not very good at poker.&lt;br&gt;- Has an abrasive, undermining personality. She's mean-spirited in a very juvenile delinquent way, being able to dish out petty jabs but not able to take them well in return.&lt;br&gt;- She was a juvenile delinquent before joining Team Magma. Now she's an adult delinquent.&lt;br&gt;- She is in her mid-twenties, and joined Team Magma a few years ago of her own volition. Team Magma gives them a pittance in pay, but does provide (one copy of) their uniforms. &lt;br&gt;- She shares a group chat with the other Team Magma grunts. She has a smartphone for this purpose.&lt;br&gt;- While she sees herself as an individual, in a way she represents all Team Magma Grunts, from Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire. Her personality is an overall mix of the various NPCs of her trainer class. &lt;br&gt;- She has been in battles against both protagonist characters (May and Brendan) from the Hoenn games, although it is intentionally left vague as to what order or circumstance they encountered each other in.&lt;br&gt;- Her favourite Pokémon species is Numel, and she has a pet Numel (and various Numel-themed merchandise items).&lt;br&gt;- She can swim, but doesn't like going into deep water, mainly because she's afraid of getting attacked by wild Pokémon.&lt;br&gt;- Incidentally, her least favourite Pokémon is Sharpedo, due to a childhood incident.&lt;br&gt;- Sexuality speaking, she is openly bisexual, and will shamelessly lust after both male and female characters - in the sense that she'll say what's on her mind about what she sees. However, she's apprehensive about other players trying to 'hook up' after the game, as she's intimidated by people who are too forward.&lt;br&gt;- She will talk at length about Team Magma's goals if given the chance, but only has a very basic/flat view of their overall goals: Capture a legendary pokemon, use it to create more land, humans use that land, and everybody profits except the water pokemon that were displaced. &lt;br&gt;- Has an intense rivalry with the Team Aqua Grunt (Team Aqua being a rival team from the same game). This can go between really dumb banter to unintentionally complimenting each other... and possibly more.</othernotes>

        <note id="112">Disabled until I can rework this into a different line. I like the idea of this line but not its implementation, it's a bit clunky. Could be better as a reveal reaction, maybe?</note>

        <note id="177">So assuming everything "works as intended", she should always go to a more specific case (such as the land, water, or sucrose branches) but this case is here as a fallback, this line works on its own and will keep the game flowing</note>
        <note id="171">Just a heads up: for the sake of letting her dialogue flow correctly, Magma Grunt won't respond to dialogue at this stage unless she can work it into her next two lines as well. More experimentation is required but for right now I'm going to try responding to the sucrose lines. - Nord, 13th of July</note>

        <note id="123">The selfie collectable should unlock at this stage when the Finished Game case runs, so this might be redundant</note>
        <note id="219">This was set to 1-4 finished masturbating, presumably because she's comparing herself to other people. But, I want this to fire in as many games as possible, and Magma Grunt tends to lose first because of her bad AI... for now, I'll make this play after just 3 rounds in stage, and take a look at possible solutions later.</note>
