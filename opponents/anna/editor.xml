        <note id="309">This is a template for interactions you can have with Anna based around coin flips
Because the CE will not allow you to Respond or Call Out a hidden case, I set up the condition for this case to play by giving it the dummy marker "coinFlipInteractionsYOURCHARACTER1"

These interactions can take place over which ever cases you want; I started it in Opponent Lost, giving our characters plenty of room to work something out on.

To start an interaction, respond to this case, replace "Anna Saying Marker: coinFlipInteractionsYOURCHARACTER1" with your character's name (If you were responding with Tharja, you would replace it with Anna Saying Marker: coinFlipInteractionsTharja1". (Hit create New marker)

Next, DELETE "Anna Said Marker: coinFlipInteractionsYOURCHARACTER1". As noted above, this is set to be sure this template case doesn't play during a match without an interaction set up.

Have your character respond with a bet, or message me on Discord (Floor#0781) about working something out. Maybe an example is "Hey, let's flip a coin, if my character wins, Anna has to flash her tits, or if my character loses, they have to reveal a dark secret!" The fun part is that we can control the RNG. We don't have to set up a scenario for each winning case (Let's be honest, Anna is probably using a rigged coin anyway), but if you want to work out a branching path, you can.

Look at Shamir's interaction to this as an example.</note>
