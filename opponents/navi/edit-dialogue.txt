#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermioine=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!

1-stripped=stripped,Well? What you think?
1-stripped=stripped,I'll have to thank Midna later for teaching me this.
1-stripped=stripped,I'm having too much fun! Can't stop now!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit,count-link:0=stripped,Actually, I learned this trick from Midna! I just didn't think it would help Link on his quest to have me this big!
1-stripped,saidMarker:ball=stripped,...to a completely new outfit!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:sayaka=stripped,What do you think, Sayaka? Does this make me a magical girl too?
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:sayaka=stripped,I think a transformation is enough to call me a magical girl? How about you, Sayaka?
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:ryuji=stripped,Ta da! No shadow creatures here, just a true-blue fairy!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:natsuki=stripped,So nice of you to notice, Natsuki, but this small body is nearly overflowing with helpful advice!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:meia=stripped,I'm glad you appreciate this form, Meia, but unfortunately, I'm a little bit smaller and <i>bluer</i> than the people back in Hyrule.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:ini=stripped,Yeah, that's going to be a no from me, Ini. The last professor I knew kept a shark in his lab.
1-must_strip_winning=must_strip,Aww... I have to strip my <i>actual</i> clothing.
1-must_strip_winning=must_strip,At least I'm winning...
1-must_strip_winning=must_strip,I may be winning, but it doesn't feel like it...

1-must_strip_winning,saidMarker:talk0,notSaidMarker:talk1,marker:talk1=must_strip,8eautiful! Now I have to strip and my voice is 8roken, too!
1-must_strip_normal=must_strip,It's okay, I don't usually wear a dress anyways.

1-must_strip_losing,hasHand:One Pair=must_strip,But... I had a pair...
1-must_strip_losing,hasHand:One Pair=must_strip,I thought the pair strategy always worked...
1-must_strip_losing,hasHand:One Pair=must_strip,It looks like having just a pair doesn't always win the round...
1-must_strip_losing,hasHand:One Pair=must_strip,But, I was so sure about that hand...
1-must_strip_losing,hasHand:One Pair=must_strip,I had a good hand too...
1-stripping=strip,No peeks, please...

1-stripping,alsoPlaying:vriska=strip,Sorry to disappoint, Vriska, but my transformation only works once...
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:vriska=strip,Unlike Vriska, I only have one magical transformation...
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:ini,alsoPlayingStage:0-4=strip,This reminds me that I wanted to talk to Link about...
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=strip,I think we both know <i>exactly</i> what Link would have to say...

2-stripped,alsoPlaying:ryuji,alsoPlayingStage:1-9=stripped,Yeah, Ryuji... this is <i>all I have...</i>
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:elizabeth=stripped,Thank y-you, Elizabeth. You're too kind, really...
2-must_strip_winning=must_strip,I guess I'll just have to look on the bright side here, I <i>think</i> I'm winning.

#OPPONENT MUST STRIP
#These lines are spoken when an opponent must strip, but the character does not yet know what they will take off.
#Writing different variations is important here, as these lines will be spoken about thirty times per game.
#The "human" versions of the lines will only be spoken if the human player is stripping.

0-male_human_must_strip=happy,He he. You won't see me strip yet!

0-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:ryuji,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:naviwho,notSaidMarker:navime,marker:navime=happy,Well, I'm Navi! Helpful fairy and advice giver extraordinaire!
0-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:sei,saidMarker:knight,notSaidMarker:knight1,marker:knight1=angry,Drat! I left in Link's pockets. Oh well, could I instead offer a mask or whatever ~player~ is about to take off?
0-male_must_strip=happy,Let's get going!
0-male_must_strip=calm,It's alright, ~name~. Sometimes it's luck, sometimes it's skill.
0-male_must_strip=puzzled,Do you need a tutorial on how to strip?
0-male_must_strip,target:bi,targetStage:0=cry,<i>HEY!</i> Bi has to wake up every morning and see himself in the mirror. I don't know if you can weaken someone's spirit more than that does.
0-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:3-4=puzzled,~name~ has just been having the worst luck. It's <i>very strange.</i>
0-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:3-4=puzzled,You're really good at poker, ~player~. Almost <i>too good.</i>
0-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:sei,saidMarker:knight,notSaidMarker:knight1,marker:knight1=horny,<i>HEY!</i> I just remembered I haven't reached that point in my adventure yet... so let's just forget about this and watch ~name~ strip.
0-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:link=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Link isn't going to be very vocal about how good his cards are, so you're going to have to study his body language.
0-male_must_strip,target:ryuji,targetSaidMarker:naviwho,notSaidMarker:navime,marker:navime=happy,Well, I'm Navi! Helpful fairy and advice giver extraordinaire! But I think you have bigger problems at the moment...

0-female_must_strip=happy,Let's go, ~name~!
0-female_must_strip=shocked,Thank Din it's you, ~name~. I almost lost that round.

0-female_must_strip,target:ini,targetStage:0,marker:slow=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Ini shouldn't be that tough to beat since she's more of a pretty face and kinda slow on the uptake.
0-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=puzzled,<i>HEY!</i> Rinkah is the fiery woman from the flame tribe, but what would happen if that fiery spirit boiled over?
0-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=horny,<i>HEY!</i> Chiaki is already one of the best gamers around, except when it comes to dating sims. Start making some moves on another player and watch her skill level plummet!

0-female_must_strip,target:cammy,targetStage:2-4=angry,There better not be more people coming, I'm running low on hearts!
0-female_must_strip,target:cammy,targetStage:2-4=cry,Here we go again...
0-female_must_strip,target:cammy,targetStage:2-4=calm,Everything looks fine for now, I think we're safe.
0-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Alice's high amount of cuteness does make her tough to take down, but just keep your wits about you and you might be able to pull this one out.
0-female_must_strip,target:erufuda,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Erufuda seems to have tried to lose a bit of wait. Unfortunately, she also kept her biggest weakness too, french fries.
0-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0=happy,<i>HEY!</i> Ruby is all about speed and fun. This also makes a big weakness when she gets excited and rushes her card swaps.
0-female_must_strip,target:sayori,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> It takes Sayori a while to get a grasp on things, so strike early while the iron's hot!
0-female_must_strip,target:cammy,targetStage:1=puzzled,I wonder if they locked the back door after I came down here?
0-female_must_strip,target:sei,saidMarker:knight,notSaidMarker:knight1,marker:knight1=cry,Maybe now's not the best time to mention this to you, ~name~. But I don't have the necessary items to proceed yet.
0-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Sei tends to throw back <i>a little</i> too much milk. Attack more the more she drinks!
0-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:3-4=puzzled,Really wierd that ~name~ has lost so many times in a row. <i>Really wierd.</i>
0-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:3-4=puzzled,~name~ has such such bad luck. You wouldn't happen to <i>know</i> anything about this, ~player~?
0-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:3-4=puzzled,I know I said I wanted you to win, ~player~, but this... doesn't feel right.
0-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0,saidMarker:knight,notSaidMarker:knight1,marker:knight1=horny,<i>HEY!</i> I just remembered I haven't reached that point in my adventure yet... so let's just forget about this and watch ~name~ strip.

0-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=happy,<i>HEY!</i> Beatrix is a sniper who lacks a left arm, so by casually throwing something at a close range, you could throw her off greatly!
0-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Vriska is perhaps the toughest opponent you could encounter in the inventory. Her incredible luck and shapeshifting outfit make taking her down an extreme challenge.

0-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=angry,<i>HEY!</i> Take the time to notice and compliment Amalia on her outfit. She might get a little bit <i>too</i> caught up in herself.
0-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0=puzzled,<i>HEY!</i> April is going to keep trying to get a scoop... of something. Keep her from getting that scoop and you might have an easier time beating her.
0-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:ruby,alsoPlayingStage:0=horny,<i>HEY!</i> The members of RWBY may be good friends, but I'm sure they've never seen each other stripping. The more of them here, the more flustered they get.
0-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:0=happy,<i>HEY!</i> Aimee gets cockier when she cocks her weapon, use this to achieve victory!
0-female_must_strip,target:rarity,targetStage:0=puzzled,<i>HEY!</i> Sorry, ~player~, but Rarity is a perfectionist and has already packed more than enough outfits to win this game. <i>Or has she?</i>
0-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=happy,<i>HEY!</i> Look out for when Mika turns around, it's the perfect time to strike with a good hand!
0-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=happy,<i>HEY!</i> I wouldn't worry too much about Trainer being an obstacle. She's just here to help, like me!

0-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:0=horny,<i>HEY!</i> If you want to keep Jura unfocused, bring out all the masculine charm you have!
0-female_must_strip,alsoPlaying:ryuji,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:naviwho,notSaidMarker:navime,marker:navime=happy,Well, I'm Navi! Helpful fairy and advice giver extraordinaire!
0-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Raven gets much worse at poker if you can get her emotions out of control. So better get your best insults ready!

0-female_must_strip,target:launch,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Keep an eye out for any major changes on Launch, that might be just the thing to throw her off and give you the edge.
0-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=angry,<i>HEY!</i> Revy might offer you a deal or begin to... <i>cuss</i>. Don't listen to any of it and you may get out of here <i>alive</i>.
0-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=puzzled,<i>HEY!</i> Joey is a natural performer. Try asking her to do some tricks. What could go wrong?
0-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Mahiru will always prefer a girl's night out, but if you want to throw her off, why not invite as many lovely men as you can?
0-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Ladybug is pretty good at this game, but she's not miraculous. Get her to start tripping over her words and you could have a chance to defeat her.
0-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=puzzled,<i>HEY!</i> Palutena seems to have some kind of god complex, so maybe you can take advantage of this false confidence?
0-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=angry,<i>HEY!</i> Palutena may try to offer advice to you on how to win. Don't listen to <i>any</i> of it!
0-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=horny,<i>HEY!</i> Meia is a tough deku nut to crack, but she'll get a lot more expressive the lewder things get.

0-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> I think Monika might have a <i>thing</i> for you. Maybe she'll even take a few rounds for you if you bat your eyes hard enough.
0-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> It doesn't look like Felicia is wearing much of anything. You should be able to take her out with a few decent hands.

0-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Nayru is a living goddess who can see the future. I don't know if she has any weaknesses but maybe you can take advantage of her honest game play!

#lost light
1-male_human_must_strip=appreciative,It's probably going to be hard to give you helpful hints, ~player~, but I'll sure try!
1-male_human_must_strip=shocked,Do you need me to remind you about which button it is, ~player~?
1-male_human_must_strip=angry,I suppose this is what you get for taking so long on your card swap.
1-male_human_must_strip=excited,C'mon, ~player~! I believe that you can do better than this!

1-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=excited,Try taking off something important, ~player~. It will distract Kyu and allow you to win!
1-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=excited,Try to show as much skin as possible. It'll distract any and all perverted fairies in the area.
1-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=embarrassed,Just don't let Kyu help you get your clothing off. Her hands are <i>very sticky</i> for some reason...
1-male_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair=interested,It's alright, ~player~, sometimes you do everything right and it still doesn't work out.
1-male_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair=puzzled,Maybe next turn you should try for something riskier than just a pair?

1-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:ryuji,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:naviwho,notSaidMarker:navime,marker:navime=happy,Well, I'm Navi! Helpful fairy and advice giver extraordinaire!
1-male_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair,hasHand:Flush=interested,Too bad. Looks like you got beat out by a flush. Beaten and they didn't even have a pair.

1-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:3-4=puzzled,~name~ has just been having the worst luck. It's <i>very strange.</i>
1-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:3-4=puzzled,You're really good at poker, ~player~. Almost <i>too good.</i>
1-male_must_strip,count-hero:1=excited,You're a hero, ~name~, show them why!
1-male_must_strip,count-hero:1=interested,To do this takes the kind of courage you only find in a true hero.
1-male_must_strip,count-hero:1=appreciative,Clothed or bare. I'm willing to stand by anyone who can prove themselves a hero.
1-male_must_strip,count-hero:1=shocked,Is this what you do between heroics, ~name~?
1-male_must_strip,count-hero:1=happy,This is just a setback, ~name~. Heroes always get back up.

1-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:5-9=angry,Could you just stop playing poker for five seconds and talk to me! I want to keep my job!

1-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=appreciative,Don't worry about being a woman, ~player~, Kyu will still get distracted. She doesn't discriminate like that.
1-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=angry,This isn't hero mode, ~player~! You should at least be able to beat the average to bad difficulty of Kyu.
1-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=puzzled,If you want to see some epilogues you have to follow my advice. Who else is gonna help you like this? <i>Kyu?</i>
1-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=appreciative,It'll be alright. <i>The best fairy in the game</i> has your back.
1-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=embarrassed,Wow, ~player~. Kyu has the same look in her eyes that you get when one of us has to strip!
1-female_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair=interested,Sorry about this. A pair can usually last you through a round.
1-female_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair=shy,This must be an exception to a normally good pair strategy.
1-female_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair=puzzled,I guess it's time to get a little riskier!
1-female_must_strip=excited,I don't want to see you wimp out now, ~name~!
1-female_must_strip=interested,You could either go for the wise choice, the courageous choice or the powerful one.
1-female_must_strip=shy,I'm sorry if I'm not the best when talking with other women. I've only worked with Link and can you <i>imagine</i> if Link was a girl?
1-female_must_strip,target:ini,targetStage:0,marker:slow=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Ini shouldn't be that tough to beat since she's more of a pretty face and kinda slow on the uptake.
1-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> It doesn't look like Felicia is wearing much of anything. You should be able to take her out with a few decent hands.
1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:2=puzzled,The weird thing about the Gerudo is that they only have one man born every 100 years.
1-female_must_strip,target:erufuda,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Erufuda seems to have tried to lose a bit of wait. Unfortunately, she also kept her biggest weakness too, french fries.
1-female_must_strip,filter:long_hair,priority:0=interested,You may have lost your outfit, but you'll still have your pretty hair.
1-female_must_strip,filter:long_hair,priority:0=puzzled,I wish I could have hair like that...
1-female_must_strip,filter:long_hair,priority:0=shy,I would have long hair if I could, but the wings keep getting in the way.
1-female_must_strip,filter:long_hair,priority:0=happy,If you want, I could make a slight breeze, so your long hair will look really pretty while you strip.
1-female_must_strip,filter:long_hair,priority:0=interested,Please tell me you aren't wearing a wig you'll strip off later.
1-female_must_strip,target:beatrix=interested,Wow, Beatrix! Can you fly with that wing?
1-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=angry,<i>HEY!</i> Take the time to notice and compliment Amalia on her outfit. She might get a little bit <i>too</i> caught up in herself.

1-female_must_strip,target:clover,targetStage:0,marker:clover_temper=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Clover has a <i>slight</i> temperament. Don't get her angry... unless you like winning.
1-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:1=interested,No offense, ~name~, but I don't care that you're tall.
1-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:1=angry,I don't see what the big deal is about Aella's height.
1-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:1=interested,I guess Aella's tall, but I don't see what the big deal is.
1-female_must_strip,filter:blue_hair,notSaidMarker:blue,priority:0,marker:blue=interested,I hate to see someone else with blue hair lose, but rules are rules.
1-female_must_strip,filter:blue_hair,notSaidMarker:blue,priority:0,marker:blue=appreciative,This may be a bad time to bring it up, but I really like your hair color, ~name~.
1-female_must_strip,filter:blue_hair,notSaidMarker:blue,priority:0,marker:blue=shy,I hate to watch you lose. You don't see many blue haired people back in Hyrule.
1-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:2=interested,<i>HEY!</i> Aella. Do you go explore dungeons a lot?
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1-4=shocked,Oh no! Is she going to do the thing again?
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1-4=cry,Get your shields out, everybody!
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1-4=shy,I'd be relieved that I'm a small target, except that probably turns me into <i>a challenge</i> for her.
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1-4=angry,<i>HEY!</i> Watch where you point that thing!
1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1-4=cry,She's gonna use that weird fire magic again!

1-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=horny,<i>HEY!</i> Chiaki is already one of the best gamers around, except when it comes to dating sims. Start making some moves on another player and watch her skill level plummet!
1-female_must_strip,target:akko=interested,I may not have the best experiences with witches, but this one might be too cute to strip.
1-female_must_strip,target:akko=angry,Everyone be on watch, you never know what trickery a <i>witch</i> might be up to.
1-female_must_strip,target:akko=puzzled,I can't tell if those big, soft brown eyes belong to an <i>evil</i> witch or just a normal witch.
1-female_must_strip,target:akko=shy,I really wish I had brought something reflective in case Akko starts throwing spells all over the place.
1-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq=interested,Maybe you should stop calling yourself a <i>monster</i> girl, I'm sure you're actually a nice person.
1-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq=shy,Please don't remove the flowers in your hair, they remind me of home.
1-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq=cry,And just when I was getting to know you...
1-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5=shy,Oh well, I guess Alice has to masturbate, sorry, there's nothing that can be done now.
1-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5=shy,It's a shame that you lost now, ~name~, but there's nothing that can be done about that.
1-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5=shy,Well it <i>looks</i> like ~name~ is all out of items, too bad you can't bring out anymore.
1-female_must_strip,target:cammy,targetStage:2-4=angry,There better not be more people coming, I'm running low on hearts!
1-female_must_strip,target:cammy,targetStage:2-4=cry,Here we go again...

1-female_must_strip,target:arwen=shocked,Ooooooh! Wow, ~name~, your ears are as pointy as Link's!
1-female_must_strip,target:arwen=appreciative,Pointy ears... green outerwear... doesn't talk much... if it wasn't for <i>everything else</i> I might mistake you for <i>you know who.</i>
1-female_must_strip,target:arwen=excited,I'm going to need you to be more enthusiastic than that, ~name~. Try screaming <i>HEY!</i> at the top of your lungs!
1-female_must_strip,target:cammy,targetStage:1=puzzled,I wonder if they locked the back door after I came down here?
1-female_must_strip,target:clover,targetStage:0,marker:clover_explode=interested,Does it make you feel nervous, ~name~? Like your stomach's gonna explode?
1-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=interested,Would you like a hint, Chiaki? They're really useful.
1-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=shy,I know you're the ultimate gamer and all, Chiaki, but would you like a hint anyways?
1-female_must_strip,target:clover,targetStage:1,marker:clover_codename=angry,Trying to beat ~player~, who I'm helping to win this game, is as dim-witted as having your code name the same as your <i>real</i> name.
1-female_must_strip,target:clover,targetStage:2,marker:clover_nine=interested,Sorry, ~name~, you're trapped here with less than nine layers remaining.
1-female_must_strip,target:beatrix,targetStage:0=happy,<i>HEY!</i> Beatrix is a sniper who lacks a left arm, so by casually throwing something at a close range, you could throw her off greatly!

1-female_must_strip,target:clover,targetStage:3,marker:clover_mind=interested,I feel like I could probably guess what you're going to strip now, like our minds are connected or something...
1-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=interested,It's too bad you only brought clothes, Corrin. You should have brought your sword, too.
1-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0=puzzled,<i>HEY!</i> April is going to keep trying to get a scoop... of something. Keep her from getting that scoop and you might have an easier time beating her.
1-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=interested,Sorry, Corrin. It looks like you're going to have to remove some of your armor this round.
1-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:3=puzzled,Since you have to strip anyways, ~name~, maybe we can see a magic trick too?
1-female_must_strip,target:jolyne,targetStage:1=appreciative,Y'know, Jolyne, I'm actually an escaped convict myself.
1-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:2=interested,Does reporting ever take you on any wild quests or adventures, April?
1-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Raven gets much worse at poker if you can get her emotions out of control. So better get your best insults ready!
1-female_must_strip,target:moon=interested,If you want to win the game, just do the exact opposite of what ~name~ does.
1-female_must_strip,target:moon=loss,Remember to avoid, ~name~, her losing aura may spread to the rest of you.
1-female_must_strip,target:moon=embarrassed,I cannot believe that we allowed such a creature of pure evil to be let in and strip in here.
1-female_must_strip,target:moon=cry,Does ~name~ make anyone else incredibly uncomfortable?
1-female_must_strip,target:rarity,targetStage:0=puzzled,<i>HEY!</i> Sorry, ~player~, but Rarity is a perfectionist and has already packed more than enough outfits to win this game. <i>Or has she?</i>

1-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=shy,It's a shame you have to strip, Pyrrha. I never like it when a hero such as yourself loses.
1-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Sei tends to throw back <i>a little</i> too much milk. Attack more the more she drinks!
1-female_must_strip,target:meia,targetStage:0=horny,<i>HEY!</i> Meia is a tough deku nut to crack, but she'll get a lot more expressive the lewder things get.
1-female_must_strip,target:ruby,alsoPlaying:weiss=interested,Well, you've got courage and power, ~name~. I suppose you could find a friend who could teach you to be a bit wiser.
1-female_must_strip,target:ruby,alsoPlaying:weiss=shocked,<i>HEY!</i> Maybe you're a little too anxious, ~name~. I mean, look over at how composed Weiss is.
1-female_must_strip,target:ruby,alsoPlaying:weiss=shy,Don't shy away now, after all your partner... or team mate... is here!
1-female_must_strip,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> I don't think Shimakaze entirely gets the point of the game, so might as well take advantage of this.
1-female_must_strip,target:mia,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Mia tends to be thrown off when an injustice or deceptively sweet woman appears, try and exploit these weak points!
1-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Vriska is perhaps the toughest opponent you could encounter in the inventory. Her incredible luck and shapeshifting outfit make taking her down an extreme challenge.
1-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:0=happy,<i>HEY!</i> Aella might seem like an impenetrable mountain, but she's also a softy for her father and gets cold very easily. Just keep finding the chinks in her armor!
1-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=shy,Now Spooky, I know that it isn't an article of clothing, but could you get rid of your knife?
1-female_must_strip,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=angry,Don't get all flustered now, your teammate's here!
1-female_must_strip,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=puzzled,You're blushing harder than I expected, ~name~. Is someone here making you a little more unsettled than usually.
1-female_must_strip,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=angry,Don't break composure now, ~name~. You're supposed to be the serious one.
1-female_must_strip,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=shocked,Ruby! Be prepared to catch ~name~ is she suddenly faints from embarrassment.
1-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:ruby,alsoPlayingStage:0=horny,<i>HEY!</i> The members of RWBY may be good friends, but I'm sure they've never seen each other stripping. The more of them here, the more flustered they get.
1-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:1=cry,That's a shame, ~name~. You don't seem to be wearing much in the way of accessories.
1-female_must_strip,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=horny,<i>HEY!</i> It may not seem it, but Natsuki <i>might</i> have a crush on you. Might as well make the most of it.
1-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:0=happy,<i>HEY!</i> I wouldn't worry too much about Trainer being an obstacle. She's just here to help, like me!

1-female_must_strip,target:nayru,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Nayru is a living goddess who can see the future. I don't know if she has any weaknesses but maybe you can take advantage of her honest game play!
1-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:3-4=puzzled,Really wierd that ~name~ has lost so many times in a row. <i>Really wierd.</i>
1-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:3-4=puzzled,~name~ has such such bad luck. You wouldn't happen to <i>know</i> anything about this, ~player~?
1-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:3-4=puzzled,I know I said I wanted you to win, ~player~, but this... doesn't feel right.
1-female_must_strip,target:zelda=excited,Show them how a princess does it!
1-female_must_strip,target:zelda=cry,I'm so sorry that you have to do this, Princess Zelda.
1-female_must_strip,target:zelda=puzzled,Y'know, I can't explain it, but something about you looks different, princess... new haircut?
1-female_must_strip,target:zelda=appreciative,I'm always here if you need assistance, Zelda!
1-female_must_strip,target:zelda=interested,I'm sorry, ~player~, but the princess comes first.
1-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=puzzled,<i>HEY!</i> Palutena seems to have some kind of god complex, so maybe you can take advantage of this false confidence?
1-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=angry,<i>HEY!</i> Palutena may try to offer advice to you on how to win. Don't listen to <i>any</i> of it!
1-female_must_strip,target:monika,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> I think Monika might have a <i>thing</i> for you. Maybe she'll even take a few rounds for you if you bat your eyes hard enough.

1-female_must_strip,target:nayru=shocked,I can't believe I get to see a real life goddess strip!

1-female_must_strip,target:nayru=happy,I'm not sure if Link said this, but thanks for the magic spell you gave us back in Hyrule!
1-female_must_strip,target:nayru=shocked,You look different than last time, Nayru. But I'm sure that's just the power of a god.
1-female_must_strip,target:nayru=shy,I'm sure you don't need any hints, Nayru. Being a goddess and all...
1-female_must_strip,target:alice_degracia,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Alice's high amount of cuteness does make her tough to take down, but just keep your wits about you and you might be able to pull this one out.
1-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chiaki,priority:500=interested,I don't think Kyu's the type of fairy you're looking for, unless your quest leads you into the bedroom.
1-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chiaki,priority:500=appreciative,Nope, not Kyu! If I may direct your attention towards the superior quest-guiding fairy floating right over here.
1-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=puzzled,Hey, Joey. Is your hair naturally blue?
1-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0=happy,<i>HEY!</i> As much as you don't want to, revealing <i>private areas</i> early leads to a distracted Kyu and easier win!
1-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=puzzled,<i>HEY!</i> Joey is a natural performer. Try asking her to do some tricks. What could go wrong?
1-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:socks,priority:500=angry,Stop lying about us fairies! I have a reputation here!

1-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,notSaidMarker:picture,marker:picture=interested,Y'know, Mahiru. I heard that fairies aren't really all that common where you're from...
1-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Mahiru will always prefer a girl's night out, but if you want to throw her off, why not invite as many lovely men as you can?
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Ladybug is pretty good at this game, but she's not miraculous. Get her to start tripping over her words and you could have a chance to defeat her.
1-female_must_strip,target:rainbow_mika,targetStage:0=happy,<i>HEY!</i> Look out for when Mika turns around, it's the perfect time to strike with a good hand!
1-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=puzzled,<i>HEY!</i> Rinkah is the fiery woman from the flame tribe, but what would happen if that fiery spirit boiled over?
1-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:3=interested,So, Mahiru. I heard you go to a school with the <i>ultimates</i> in certain areas.
1-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=puzzled,I know you're a little busy now, Rinkah, but I was wondering how I could get to be as strong as you are.
1-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:alice_mgq,alsoPlayingStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Alice may act all superior, but I'm sure if you get her down far enough, we'll see a different side of her.
1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=interested,What are you going to take off, Ladybug? It doesn't look like you brought much aside from that mask and belt.
1-female_must_strip,target:natsuki=puzzled,What are they even teaching kids in school's these days?
1-female_must_strip,target:natsuki=angry,You could stand to be a little more <i>helpful</i>, ~name~.
1-female_must_strip,target:natsuki=calm,Consider this another learning experience, ~name~.
1-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0=happy,<i>HEY!</i> Ruby is all about speed and fun. This also makes a big weakness when she gets excited and rushes her card swaps.


#lost dress
2-male_human_must_strip=interested,Now <i>this</i> is a step in the right direction.
2-male_human_must_strip=excited,<i>HEY!</i> Try not to feel the burning sense of shame that's making your cheeks go red.
2-male_human_must_strip=embarrassed,It seems that ~player~ and I <i>both</i> are feeling a little heat.
2-male_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair,hasHand:Flush=interested,Too bad. Looks like you got beat out by a flush. Beaten and they didn't even have a pair.
2-male_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair,hasHand:Flush=puzzled,Guess you got beat out by a flush. They may not have a pair, but it's still a higher hand than yours.
2-male_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair=interested,It's alright, ~player~, sometimes you do everything right and it still doesn't work out.
2-male_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair=puzzled,Maybe next turn you should try for something riskier than just a pair?
2-male_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair=excited,<i>HEY!</i> You <i>LISTENED</i> to my advice! You still have to strip, though.
2-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=angry,Come on, ~player~! My hints should be helping you out so much more than this!
2-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=angry,C'mon, ~player~! You lost to Kyu, who isn't even at a hard difficulty!
2-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=excited,Try taking off something important, ~player~. It will distract Kyu and allow you to win!
2-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=excited,Try to show as much skin as possible. It'll distract any and all perverted fairies in the area.
2-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=embarrassed,Just don't let Kyu help you get your clothing off. Her hands are <i>very sticky</i> for some reason...
2-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:ryuji,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:naviwho,notSaidMarker:navime,marker:navime=happy,Well, I'm Navi! Helpful fairy and advice giver extraordinaire!
2-male_human_must_strip,saidMarker:talk0,notSaidMarker:talk1,marker:talk1=angry,8eautiful! Now, my voice is 8roken, too!
2-male_must_strip=interested,We won't be needing a mystic lens this time.
2-male_must_strip=calm,May the courage of Farore be with you.
2-male_must_strip=shocked,Would you like a suggestion on what to strip?
2-male_must_strip,saidMarker:talk0,notSaidMarker:talk1,marker:talk1=angry,8eautiful! Now, my voice is 8roken, too!
2-male_must_strip,count-hero:1=excited,You're a hero, ~name~, show them why!
2-male_must_strip,count-hero:1=interested,To do this takes the kind of courage you only find in a true hero.
2-male_must_strip,count-hero:1=appreciative,Clothed or bare. I'm willing to stand by anyone who can prove themselves a hero.
2-male_must_strip,count-hero:1=shocked,Is this what you do between heroics, ~name~?
2-male_must_strip,count-hero:1=happy,This is just a setback, ~name~. Heroes always get back up.
2-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:link=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Link isn't going to be very vocal about how good his cards are, so you're going to have to study his body language.
2-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:ryuji,notSaidMarker:navime,marker:navime=happy,Well, I'm Navi! Helpful fairy and advice giver extraordinaire!
2-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:4=puzzled,Huh? Link did you..?

2-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:3-4=puzzled,~name~ has just been having the worst luck. It's <i>very strange.</i>
2-male_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:3-4=puzzled,You're really good at poker, ~player~. Almost <i>too good.</i>
2-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:5-9=cry,C'mon, Link! Just be quiet again, for old times' sake.
2-male_must_strip,target:link,targetStage:5-9=angry,Could you just stop playing poker for five seconds and talk to me! I want to keep my job!
2-male_must_strip,target:ryuji,targetSaidMarker:naviwho,notSaidMarker:navime,marker:navime=happy,Well, I'm Navi! Helpful fairy and advice giver extraordinaire! But I think you have bigger problems at the moment...
2-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:pit=happy,<i>HEY!</i> Pit is a real talkative guy. Start engaging him in conversation and he'll have no time to look at his cards!
2-female_human_must_strip=interested,It's okay, ~name~! We all lose from time to time!
2-female_human_must_strip=interested,It's alright, ~name~, I'm here for you 'til the end.
2-female_human_must_strip=happy,<i>HEY!</i> ~player~! I'm not giving up hope on you, so you shouldn't either.
2-female_human_must_strip,saidMarker:talk0,notSaidMarker:talk1,marker:talk1=angry,8eautiful! Now, my voice is 8roken, too!
2-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=appreciative,Don't worry about being a woman, ~player~, Kyu will still get distracted. She doesn't discriminate like that.
2-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=angry,This isn't hero mode, ~player~! You should at least be able to beat the average to bad difficulty of Kyu.
2-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=puzzled,If you want to see some epilogues you have to follow my advice. Who else is gonna help you like this? <i>Kyu?</i>
2-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=appreciative,It'll be alright. <i>The best fairy in the game</i> has your back.
2-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=embarrassed,Wow, ~player~. Kyu has the same look in her eyes that you get when one of us has to strip!
2-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:ryuji,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:naviwho,notSaidMarker:navime,marker:navime=happy,Well, I'm Navi! Helpful fairy and advice giver extraordinaire!
2-female_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair=interested,Sorry about this. A pair can usually last you through a round.
2-female_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair=shy,This must be an exception to a normally good pair strategy.
2-female_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair=puzzled,I guess it's time to get a little riskier!
2-female_must_strip=happy,It's all about layers, the more you have, the longer you get to play!
2-female_must_strip=happy,Well now you can be free to stretch out even more!
2-female_must_strip=embarrassed,Well, I've got only one thing left to lose. Let's see what you've got, ~name~.
2-female_must_strip,filter:blue_hair,notSaidMarker:blue,priority:0,marker:blue=interested,I hate to see someone else with blue hair lose, but rules are rules.
2-female_must_strip,filter:blue_hair,notSaidMarker:blue,priority:0,marker:blue=appreciative,This may be a bad time to bring it up, but I really like your hair color, ~name~.
2-female_must_strip,filter:blue_hair,notSaidMarker:blue,priority:0,marker:blue=shy,I hate to watch you lose. You don't see many blue haired people back in Hyrule.
2-female_must_strip,filter:long_hair,priority:0=interested,You may have lost your outfit, but you'll still have your pretty hair.
2-female_must_strip,filter:long_hair,priority:0=puzzled,I wish I could have hair like that...
2-female_must_strip,filter:long_hair,priority:0=shy,I would have long hair if I could, but the wings keep getting in the way.
2-female_must_strip,filter:long_hair,priority:0=happy,If you want, I could make a slight breeze, so your long hair will look really pretty while you strip.
2-female_must_strip,filter:long_hair,priority:0=interested,Please tell me you aren't wearing a wig you'll strip off later.
2-female_must_strip,count-cheerful:2=interested,C'mon, ~name~! Keep that upbeat attitude!
2-female_must_strip,count-cheerful:2=happy,Gotta keep that pep in your step... or float... or... You all get what I mean!
2-female_must_strip,count-cheerful:2=excited,You're doing great, ~name~. Keep it up!
2-female_must_strip,count-cheerful:2=happy,We'll have to cheer on whoever strips after you, ~name~.
2-female_must_strip,count-cheerful:2=horny,You really help to brighten the room, ~name~!

2-female_must_strip,target:raven,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Raven gets much worse at poker if you can get her emotions out of control. So better get your best insults ready!
2-female_must_strip,target:felicia,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> It doesn't look like Felicia is wearing much of anything. You should be able to take her out with a few decent hands.
2-female_must_strip,target:revy,targetStage:0=angry,<i>HEY!</i> Revy might offer you a deal or begin to... <i>cuss</i>. Don't listen to any of it and you may get out of here <i>alive</i>.

2-female_must_strip,target:ruby,targetStage:0=happy,<i>HEY!</i> Ruby is all about speed and fun. This also makes a big weakness when she gets excited and rushes her card swaps.
2-female_must_strip,target:sayori,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> It takes Sayori a while to get a grasp on things, so strike early while the iron's hot!
2-female_must_strip,target:sei,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Sei tends to throw back <i>a little</i> too much milk. Attack more the more she drinks!
2-female_must_strip,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> I don't think Shimakaze entirely gets the point of the game, so might as well take advantage of this.
2-female_must_strip,target:vriska,targetStage:0=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Vriska is perhaps the toughest opponent you could encounter in the inventory. Her incredible luck and shapeshifting outfit make taking her down an extreme challenge.
2-female_must_strip,target:weiss,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:ruby,alsoPlayingStage:0=horny,<i>HEY!</i> The members of RWBY may be good friends, but I'm sure they've never seen each other stripping. The more of them here, the more flustered they get.

2-female_must_strip,target:ini,targetStage:0,marker:slow=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Ini shouldn't be that tough to beat since she's more of a pretty face and kinda slow on the uptake.
2-female_must_strip,target:palutena,targetStage:0=puzzled,<i>HEY!</i> Palutena seems to have some kind of god complex, so maybe you can take advantage of this false confidence?

2-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:0=puzzled,<i>HEY!</i> April is going to keep trying to get a scoop... of something. Keep her from getting that scoop and you might have an easier time beating her.

2-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=interested,It's too bad you only brought clothes, Corrin. You should have brought your sword, too.

2-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=interested,Sorry, Corrin. It looks like you're going to have to remove some of your armor this round.

2-female_must_strip,target:amalia,targetStage:0=angry,<i>HEY!</i> Take the time to notice and compliment Amalia on her outfit. She might get a little bit <i>too</i> caught up in herself.
2-female_must_strip,target:ruby,alsoPlaying:weiss=interested,Well, you've got courage and power, ~name~. I suppose you could find a friend who could teach you to be a bit wiser.
2-female_must_strip,target:ruby,alsoPlaying:weiss=shocked,<i>HEY!</i> Maybe you're a little too anxious, ~name~. I mean, look over at how composed Weiss is.
2-female_must_strip,target:ruby,alsoPlaying:weiss=shy,Don't shy away now, after all your partner... or team mate... is here!

2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1=interested,You know, I know a race of all women too.
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1=excited,I actually know about a race of all women, just like yours.
2-female_must_strip,target:nayru=shocked,I can't believe I get to see a real life goddess strip!

2-female_must_strip,target:moon=interested,If you want to win the game, just do the exact opposite of what ~name~ does.
2-female_must_strip,target:moon=loss,Remember to avoid, ~name~, her losing aura may spread to the rest of you.
2-female_must_strip,target:moon=embarrassed,I cannot believe that we allowed such a creature of pure evil to be let in and strip in here.
2-female_must_strip,target:moon=cry,Does ~name~ make anyone else incredibly uncomfortable?
2-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:3=interested,So, Mahiru. I heard you go to a school with the <i>ultimates</i> in certain areas.
2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:2=puzzled,The weird thing about the Gerudo is that they only have one man born every 100 years.

2-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=shy,It's a shame you have to strip, Pyrrha. I never like it when a hero such as yourself loses.

2-female_must_strip,target:akko=puzzled,I can't tell if those big, soft brown eyes belong to an <i>evil</i> witch or just a normal witch.
2-female_must_strip,target:akko=shy,I really wish I had brought something reflective in case Akko starts throwing spells all over the place.
2-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq=interested,Maybe you should stop calling yourself a <i>monster</i> girl, I'm sure you're actually a nice person.

2-female_must_strip,target:zelda=excited,Show them how a princess does it!
2-female_must_strip,target:zelda=cry,I'm so sorry that you have to do this, Princess Zelda.
2-female_must_strip,target:zelda=puzzled,Y'know, I can't explain it, but something about you looks different, princess... new haircut?

-3-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=angry,C'mon, ~player~! You lost to Kyu, who isn't even at a hard difficulty!
-3-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=excited,Try taking off something important, ~player~. It will distract Kyu and allow you to win!
-3-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=excited,Try to show as much skin as possible. It'll distract any and all perverted fairies in the area.
-3-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=embarrassed,Just don't let Kyu help you get your clothing off. Her hands are <i>very sticky</i> for some reason...
-3-male_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair,hasHand:Flush=interested,Too bad. Looks like you got beat out by a flush. Beaten and they didn't even have a pair.
-3-male_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair,hasHand:Flush=puzzled,Guess you got beat out by a flush. They may not have a pair, but it's still a higher hand than yours.
-3-male_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair=interested,It's alright, ~player~, sometimes you do everything right and it still doesn't work out.
-3-male_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair=puzzled,Maybe next turn you should try for something riskier than just a pair?
-3-male_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair=excited,<i>HEY!</i> You <i>LISTENED</i> to my advice! You still have to strip, though.
-3-male_must_strip=interested,What's it gonna be, ~name~?

-3-male_must_strip,count-hero:1=excited,You're a hero, ~name~, show them why!
-3-male_must_strip,count-hero:1=interested,To do this takes the kind of courage you only find in a true hero.
-3-male_must_strip,count-hero:1=appreciative,Clothed or bare. I'm willing to stand by anyone who can prove themselves a hero.
-3-male_must_strip,count-hero:1=shocked,Is this what you do between heroics, ~name~?
-3-male_must_strip,count-hero:1=happy,This is just a setback, ~name~. Heroes always get back up.
-3-male_must_strip,alsoPlaying:link=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Link isn't going to be very vocal about how good his cards are, so you're going to have to study his body language.
-3-male_must_strip,target:9s=interested,I hope you didn't get that mask from this one creepy guy in town...
-3-female_human_must_strip=embarrassed,Take your time, really. I've got nothing better to do over here.
-3-female_human_must_strip=excited,Try to take it off in a single motion!
-3-female_human_must_strip=shy,Maybe next round, ~player~.
-3-female_human_must_strip,saidMarker:talk0,notSaidMarker:talk1,marker:talk1=angry,8eautiful! Now, my voice is 8roken, too!
-3-female_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair=interested,Sorry about this. A pair can usually last you through a round.
-3-female_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair=shy,This must be an exception to a normally good pair strategy.
-3-female_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair=puzzled,I guess it's time to get a little riskier!
-3-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=appreciative,Don't worry about being a woman, ~player~, Kyu will still get distracted. She doesn't discriminate like that.
-3-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=angry,This isn't hero mode, ~player~! You should at least be able to beat the average to bad difficulty of Kyu.
-3-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=puzzled,If you want to see some epilogues you have to follow my advice. Who else is gonna help you like this? <i>Kyu?</i>
-3-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=appreciative,It'll be alright. <i>The best fairy in the game</i> has your back.
-3-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=embarrassed,Wow, ~player~. Kyu has the same look in her eyes that you get when one of us has to strip!
-3-female_must_strip=interested,Could be worse... a lot worse...
-3-female_must_strip=angry,<i>HEY!</i> You better not have some secret layer that no one knows about!
-3-female_must_strip=excited,It's alright! Every one of my <i>(one... two... three...)</i> three losses were mistakes too!
-3-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,notSaidMarker:picture,marker:picture=interested,Y'know, Mahiru. I heard that fairies aren't really all that common where you're from...
-3-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:3=interested,So, Mahiru. I heard you go to a school with the <i>ultimates</i> in certain areas.
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon=interested,If you want to win the game, just do the exact opposite of what ~name~ does.
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon=loss,Remember to avoid, ~name~, her losing aura may spread to the rest of you.
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon=embarrassed,I cannot believe that we allowed such a creature of pure evil to be let in and strip in here.
-3-female_must_strip,target:moon=cry,Does ~name~ make anyone else incredibly uncomfortable?
-3-female_must_strip,target:natsuki=puzzled,What are they even teaching kids in school's these days?
-3-female_must_strip,target:natsuki=angry,You could stand to be a little more <i>helpful</i>, ~name~.
-3-female_must_strip,target:natsuki=calm,Consider this another learning experience, ~name~.
-3-female_must_strip,target:nayru=shocked,I can't believe I get to see a real life goddess strip!
-3-female_must_strip,target:nayru=excited,Show us your golden body, Golden Goddess!
-3-female_must_strip,target:nayru=happy,I'm not sure if Link said this, but thanks for the magic spell you gave us back in Hyrule!
-3-female_must_strip,target:nayru=shocked,You look different than last time, Nayru. But I'm sure that's just the power of a god.
-3-female_must_strip,target:nayru=shy,I'm sure you don't need any hints, Nayru. Being a goddess and all...
-3-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:2=puzzled,~name~ has to go. Honestly, I'm surprised she even wears a bra.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ruby,alsoPlaying:weiss=interested,Well, you've got courage and power, ~name~. I suppose you could find a friend who could teach you to be a bit wiser.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ruby,alsoPlaying:weiss=shocked,<i>HEY!</i> Maybe you're a little too anxious, ~name~. I mean, look over at how composed Weiss is.
-3-female_must_strip,target:ruby,alsoPlaying:weiss=shy,Don't shy away now, after all your partner... or team mate... is here!
-3-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=shy,Now Spooky, I know that it isn't an article of clothing, but could you get rid of your knife?
-3-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:1=cry,That's a shame, ~name~. You don't seem to be wearing much in the way of accessories.

-3-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:1=interested,No offense, ~name~, but I don't care that you're tall.
-3-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:1=angry,I don't see what the big deal is about Aella's height.

-3-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:3-4=puzzled,Really wierd that ~name~ has lost so many times in a row. <i>Really wierd.</i>
-3-female_must_strip,consecutiveLosses:3-4=puzzled,~name~ has such such bad luck. You wouldn't happen to <i>know</i> anything about this, ~player~?

-2-male_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair=interested,It's alright, ~player~, sometimes you do everything right and it still doesn't work out.
-2-male_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair=puzzled,Maybe next turn you should try for something riskier than just a pair?
-2-male_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair=excited,<i>HEY!</i> You <i>LISTENED</i> to my advice! You still have to strip, though.

-2-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=excited,Try taking off something important, ~player~. It will distract Kyu and allow you to win!
-2-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=excited,Try to show as much skin as possible. It'll distract any and all perverted fairies in the area.
-2-male_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=embarrassed,Just don't let Kyu help you get your clothing off. Her hands are <i>very sticky</i> for some reason...
-2-male_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair,hasHand:Flush=interested,Too bad. Looks like you got beat out by a flush. Beaten and they didn't even have a pair.
-2-male_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair,hasHand:Flush=puzzled,Guess you got beat out by a flush. They may not have a pair, but it's still a higher hand than yours.

-2-male_must_strip=happy,I feel the blood in my cheeks. Am I turning purple?
-2-male_must_strip=excited,There's no sidestepping this one!

-2-female_human_must_strip,oppHand:One Pair=puzzled,I guess it's time to get a little riskier!
-2-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=appreciative,Don't worry about being a woman, ~player~, Kyu will still get distracted. She doesn't discriminate like that.
-2-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=angry,This isn't hero mode, ~player~! You should at least be able to beat the average to bad difficulty of Kyu.
-2-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=puzzled,If you want to see some epilogues you have to follow my advice. Who else is gonna help you like this? <i>Kyu?</i>
-2-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=appreciative,It'll be alright. <i>The best fairy in the game</i> has your back.
-2-female_human_must_strip,alsoPlaying:kyu=embarrassed,Wow, ~player~. Kyu has the same look in her eyes that you get when one of us has to strip!

-2-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq=interested,Maybe you should stop calling yourself a <i>monster</i> girl, I'm sure you're actually a nice person.
-2-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq=shy,Please don't remove the flowers in your hair, they remind me of home.
-2-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq=cry,And just when I was getting to know you...
-2-female_must_strip,target:akko=interested,I may not have the best experiences with witches, but this one might be too cute to strip.
-2-female_must_strip,target:akko=angry,Everyone be on watch, you never know what trickery a <i>witch</i> might be up to.
-2-female_must_strip,target:akko=puzzled,I can't tell if those big, soft brown eyes belong to an <i>evil</i> witch or just a normal witch.
-2-female_must_strip,target:akko=shy,I really wish I had brought something reflective in case Akko starts throwing spells all over the place.
-2-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:2=puzzled,The weird thing about the Gerudo is that they only have one man born every 100 years.

-2-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5=shy,It's a shame that you lost now, ~name~, but there's nothing that can be done about that.

-2-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:3=puzzled,Since you have to strip anyways, ~name~, maybe we can see a magic trick too?

-2-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=interested,Sorry, Corrin. It looks like you're going to have to remove some of your armor this round.
-2-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=puzzled,Hey, Joey. Is your hair naturally blue?
-2-female_must_strip,target:arwen=shocked,Ooooooh! Wow, ~name~, your ears are as pointy as Link's!
-2-female_must_strip,target:arwen=appreciative,Pointy ears... green outerwear... doesn't talk much... if it wasn't for <i>everything else</i> I might mistake you for <i>you know who.</i>
-2-female_must_strip,target:arwen=excited,I'm going to need you to be more enthusiastic than that, ~name~. Try screaming <i>HEY!</i> at the top of your lungs!
-2-female_must_strip,target:jenetta,targetStage:1=puzzled,What even are you, Jenetta? I've never seen anyone else with ears like those.
-2-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:1=cry,That's a shame, ~name~. You don't seem to be wearing much in the way of accessories.
-2-female_must_strip,target:beatrix=interested,Wow, Beatrix! Can you fly with that wing?
-2-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=interested,It's too bad you only brought clothes, Corrin. You should have brought your sword, too.
-2-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=interested,What are you going to take off, Ladybug? It doesn't look like you brought much aside from that mask and belt.
-2-female_must_strip,target:cammy,targetStage:2-4=angry,There better not be more people coming, I'm running low on hearts!
-2-female_must_strip,target:cammy,targetStage:2-4=cry,Here we go again...

-2-female_must_strip,target:clover,targetStage:3,marker:clover_mind=interested,I feel like I could probably guess what you're going to strip now, like our minds are connected or something...
-2-female_must_strip,target:nayru=shocked,I can't believe I get to see a real life goddess strip!
-2-female_must_strip,target:nayru=excited,Show us your golden body, Golden Goddess!
-2-female_must_strip,target:nayru=happy,I'm not sure if Link said this, but thanks for the magic spell you gave us back in Hyrule!
-2-female_must_strip,target:nayru=shocked,You look different than last time, Nayru. But I'm sure that's just the power of a god.
-2-female_must_strip,target:nayru=shy,I'm sure you don't need any hints, Nayru. Being a goddess and all...
-2-female_must_strip,target:clover,targetStage:1,marker:clover_codename=angry,Trying to beat ~player~, who I'm helping to win this game, is as dim-witted as having your code name the same as your <i>real</i> name.
-2-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=shy,Now Spooky, I know that it isn't an article of clothing, but could you get rid of your knife?
-2-female_must_strip,target:clover,targetStage:3,marker:clover_game=happy,You keep talking about a game, Clover. Is it a fun game?
-2-female_must_strip,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=angry,Don't get all flustered now, your teammate's here!
-2-female_must_strip,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=puzzled,You're blushing harder than I expected, ~name~. Is someone here making you a little more unsettled than usually.
-2-female_must_strip,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=angry,Don't break composure now, ~name~. You're supposed to be the serious one.
-2-female_must_strip,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=shocked,Ruby! Be prepared to catch ~name~ is she suddenly faints from embarrassment.
-2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1-4=shocked,Oh no! Is she going to do the thing again?
-2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1-4=cry,Get your shields out, everybody!
-2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1-4=shy,I'd be relieved that I'm a small target, except that probably turns me into <i>a challenge</i> for her.
-2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1-4=angry,<i>HEY!</i> Watch where you point that thing!
-2-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1-4=cry,She's gonna use that weird fire magic again!

-2-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chiaki,priority:500=interested,I don't think Kyu's the type of fairy you're looking for, unless your quest leads you into the bedroom.
-2-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chiaki,priority:500=appreciative,Nope, not Kyu! If I may direct your attention towards the superior quest-guiding fairy floating right over here.
-2-female_must_strip,target:moon=interested,If you want to win the game, just do the exact opposite of what ~name~ does.
-2-female_must_strip,target:moon=loss,Remember to avoid, ~name~, her losing aura may spread to the rest of you.
-2-female_must_strip,target:moon=embarrassed,I cannot believe that we allowed such a creature of pure evil to be let in and strip in here.
-2-female_must_strip,target:moon=cry,Does ~name~ make anyone else incredibly uncomfortable?
-2-female_must_strip,target:clover,targetStage:0,marker:clover_temper=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Clover has a <i>slight</i> temperament. Don't get her angry... unless you like winning.

-2-female_must_strip,filter:long_hair,priority:0=interested,You may have lost your outfit, but you'll still have your pretty hair.
-2-female_must_strip,filter:long_hair,priority:0=puzzled,I wish I could have hair like that...
-2-female_must_strip,filter:long_hair,priority:0=shy,I would have long hair if I could, but the wings keep getting in the way.
-2-female_must_strip,filter:long_hair,priority:0=happy,If you want, I could make a slight breeze, so your long hair will look really pretty while you strip.
-2-female_must_strip,filter:long_hair,priority:0=interested,Please tell me you aren't wearing a wig you'll strip off later.
-2-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,notSaidMarker:picture,marker:picture=interested,Y'know, Mahiru. I heard that fairies aren't really all that common where you're from...
-2-female_must_strip,target:ruby,alsoPlaying:weiss=interested,Well, you've got courage and power, ~name~. I suppose you could find a friend who could teach you to be a bit wiser.
-2-female_must_strip,target:ruby,alsoPlaying:weiss=shocked,<i>HEY!</i> Maybe you're a little too anxious, ~name~. I mean, look over at how composed Weiss is.
-2-female_must_strip,target:ruby,alsoPlaying:weiss=shy,Don't shy away now, after all your partner... or team mate... is here!
-2-female_must_strip,target:zelda=excited,Show them how a princess does it!
-2-female_must_strip,target:zelda=cry,I'm so sorry that you have to do this, Princess Zelda.
-2-female_must_strip,target:zelda=puzzled,Y'know, I can't explain it, but something about you looks different, princess... new haircut?
-2-female_must_strip,target:zelda=appreciative,I'm always here if you need assistance, Zelda!
-2-female_must_strip,target:zelda=interested,I'm sorry, ~player~, but the princess comes first.

-2-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:1=interested,No offense, ~name~, but I don't care that you're tall.
-2-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:1=angry,I don't see what the big deal is about Aella's height.

-1-female_must_strip,target:natsuki=calm,Consider this another learning experience, ~name~.
-1-female_must_strip,target:jolyne,targetStage:1=appreciative,Y'know, Jolyne, I'm actually an escaped convict myself.
-1-female_must_strip,target:clover,targetStage:3,marker:clover_game=happy,You keep talking about a game, Clover. Is it a fun game?
-1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1=interested,You know, I know a race of all women too.
-1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:1=excited,I actually know about a race of all women, just like yours.
-1-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:2,targetSaidMarker:socks,priority:500=angry,Stop lying about us fairies! I have a reputation here!
-1-female_must_strip,target:moon=interested,If you want to win the game, just do the exact opposite of what ~name~ does.
-1-female_must_strip,target:moon=loss,Remember to avoid, ~name~, her losing aura may spread to the rest of you.
-1-female_must_strip,target:moon=embarrassed,I cannot believe that we allowed such a creature of pure evil to be let in and strip in here.
-1-female_must_strip,target:moon=cry,Does ~name~ make anyone else incredibly uncomfortable?
-1-female_must_strip,target:marinette,targetStage:0=interested,What are you going to take off, Ladybug? It doesn't look like you brought much aside from that mask and belt.
-1-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,notSaidMarker:picture,marker:picture=interested,Y'know, Mahiru. I heard that fairies aren't really all that common where you're from...
-1-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:3=puzzled,Since you have to strip anyways, ~name~, maybe we can see a magic trick too?
-1-female_must_strip,target:jura,targetStage:2=puzzled,The weird thing about the Gerudo is that they only have one man born every 100 years.
-1-female_must_strip,target:pyrrha,targetStage:0=shy,It's a shame you have to strip, Pyrrha. I never like it when a hero such as yourself loses.
-1-female_must_strip,target:joey,targetStage:0=puzzled,Hey, Joey. Is your hair naturally blue?
-1-female_must_strip,target:mahiru,targetStage:3=interested,So, Mahiru. I heard you go to a school with the <i>ultimates</i> in certain areas.
-1-female_must_strip,target:ruby,alsoPlaying:weiss=interested,Well, you've got courage and power, ~name~. I suppose you could find a friend who could teach you to be a bit wiser.
-1-female_must_strip,target:ruby,alsoPlaying:weiss=shocked,<i>HEY!</i> Maybe you're a little too anxious, ~name~. I mean, look over at how composed Weiss is.
-1-female_must_strip,target:ruby,alsoPlaying:weiss=shy,Don't shy away now, after all your partner... or team mate... is here!
-1-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chiaki,priority:500=interested,I don't think Kyu's the type of fairy you're looking for, unless your quest leads you into the bedroom.
-1-female_must_strip,target:kyu,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:chiaki,priority:500=appreciative,Nope, not Kyu! If I may direct your attention towards the superior quest-guiding fairy floating right over here.
-1-female_must_strip,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=interested,Sorry, Corrin. It looks like you're going to have to remove some of your armor this round.
-1-female_must_strip,target:clover,targetStage:3,marker:clover_mind=interested,I feel like I could probably guess what you're going to strip now, like our minds are connected or something...
-1-female_must_strip,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=puzzled,I know you're a little busy now, Rinkah, but I was wondering how I could get to be as strong as you are.
-1-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:1=cry,That's a shame, ~name~. You don't seem to be wearing much in the way of accessories.
-1-female_must_strip,target:akko=interested,I may not have the best experiences with witches, but this one might be too cute to strip.
-1-female_must_strip,target:akko=angry,Everyone be on watch, you never know what trickery a <i>witch</i> might be up to.
-1-female_must_strip,target:akko=puzzled,I can't tell if those big, soft brown eyes belong to an <i>evil</i> witch or just a normal witch.
-1-female_must_strip,target:akko=shy,I really wish I had brought something reflective in case Akko starts throwing spells all over the place.
-1-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5=shy,Oh well, I guess Alice has to masturbate, sorry, there's nothing that can be done now.
-1-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5=shy,It's a shame that you lost now, ~name~, but there's nothing that can be done about that.
-1-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:5=shy,Well it <i>looks</i> like ~name~ is all out of items, too bad you can't bring out anymore.
-1-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq=interested,Maybe you should stop calling yourself a <i>monster</i> girl, I'm sure you're actually a nice person.
-1-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq=shy,Please don't remove the flowers in your hair, they remind me of home.
-1-female_must_strip,target:alice_mgq=cry,And just when I was getting to know you...
-1-female_must_strip,target:clover,targetStage:0,marker:clover_explode=interested,Does it make you feel nervous, ~name~? Like your stomach's gonna explode?
-1-female_must_strip,target:clover,targetStage:2,marker:clover_nine=interested,Sorry, ~name~, you're trapped here with less than nine layers remaining.
-1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1-4=shocked,Oh no! Is she going to do the thing again?
-1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1-4=cry,Get your shields out, everybody!
-1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1-4=shy,I'd be relieved that I'm a small target, except that probably turns me into <i>a challenge</i> for her.
-1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1-4=angry,<i>HEY!</i> Watch where you point that thing!
-1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1-4=cry,She's gonna use that weird fire magic again!
-1-female_must_strip,target:aimee,targetStage:1-4=cry,Here we go again!

-1-female_must_strip,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=angry,Don't get all flustered now, your teammate's here!
-1-female_must_strip,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=puzzled,You're blushing harder than I expected, ~name~. Is someone here making you a little more unsettled than usually.
-1-female_must_strip,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=angry,Don't break composure now, ~name~. You're supposed to be the serious one.
-1-female_must_strip,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=shocked,Ruby! Be prepared to catch ~name~ is she suddenly faints from embarrassment.
-1-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:2=puzzled,~name~ has to go. Honestly, I'm surprised she even wears a bra.
-1-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:2=interested,<i>HEY!</i> Aella. Do you go explore dungeons a lot?
-1-female_must_strip,target:zelda=excited,Show them how a princess does it!
-1-female_must_strip,target:zelda=cry,I'm so sorry that you have to do this, Princess Zelda.
-1-female_must_strip,target:zelda=puzzled,Y'know, I can't explain it, but something about you looks different, princess... new haircut?
-1-female_must_strip,target:zelda=appreciative,I'm always here if you need assistance, Zelda!
-1-female_must_strip,target:zelda=interested,I'm sorry, ~player~, but the princess comes first.
-1-female_must_strip,saidMarker:talk0,notSaidMarker:talk1,marker:talk1=angry,8eautiful! Now, my voice is 8roken, too!
-1-female_must_strip,filter:long_hair,priority:0=interested,You may have lost your outfit, but you'll still have your pretty hair.
-1-female_must_strip,filter:long_hair,priority:0=puzzled,I wish I could have hair like that...
-1-female_must_strip,filter:long_hair,priority:0=shy,I would have long hair if I could, but the wings keep getting in the way.
-1-female_must_strip,filter:long_hair,priority:0=happy,If you want, I could make a slight breeze, so your long hair will look really pretty while you strip.
-1-female_must_strip,filter:long_hair,priority:0=interested,Please tell me you aren't wearing a wig you'll strip off later.
-1-female_must_strip,target:clover,targetStage:0,marker:clover_temper=calm,<i>HEY!</i> Clover has a <i>slight</i> temperament. Don't get her angry... unless you like winning.
-1-female_must_strip,filter:blue_hair,notSaidMarker:blue,priority:0,marker:blue=interested,I hate to see someone else with blue hair lose, but rules are rules.

-1-female_must_strip,target:cammy,targetStage:1=puzzled,I wonder if they locked the back door after I came down here?
-1-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:1=interested,No offense, ~name~, but I don't care that you're tall.
-1-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:1=angry,I don't see what the big deal is about Aella's height.
-1-female_must_strip,target:aella,targetStage:1=interested,I guess Aella's tall, but I don't see what the big deal is.
-1-female_must_strip,target:alpha,targetStage:4,notSaidMarker:roll,marker:roll=interested,Listen to the rippling rhythm of ~name~'s singing...
-1-female_must_strip,target:cammy,targetStage:2-4=angry,There better not be more people coming, I'm running low on hearts!
-1-female_must_strip,target:cammy,targetStage:2-4=cry,Here we go again...
-1-female_must_strip,target:cammy,targetStage:2-4=calm,Everything looks fine for now, I think we're safe.
-1-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=interested,Would you like a hint, Chiaki? They're really useful.
-1-female_must_strip,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=shy,I know you're the ultimate gamer and all, Chiaki, but would you like a hint anyways?
-1-female_must_strip,target:spooky,targetStage:0=shy,Now Spooky, I know that it isn't an article of clothing, but could you get rid of your knife?
-1-female_must_strip,target:clover,targetStage:1,marker:clover_codename=angry,Trying to beat ~player~, who I'm helping to win this game, is as dim-witted as having your code name the same as your <i>real</i> name.
-1-female_must_strip,target:april,targetStage:2=interested,Does reporting ever take you on any wild quests or adventures, April?
-1-female_must_strip,target:jenetta,targetStage:1=puzzled,What even are you, Jenetta? I've never seen anyone else with ears like those.
-1-female_must_strip,target:beatrix=interested,Wow, Beatrix! Can you fly with that wing?
-1-female_must_strip,target:arwen=shocked,Ooooooh! Wow, ~name~, your ears are as pointy as Link's!
-1-female_must_strip,target:arwen=appreciative,Pointy ears... green outerwear... doesn't talk much... if it wasn't for <i>everything else</i> I might mistake you for <i>you know who.</i>
-1-female_must_strip,target:arwen=excited,I'm going to need you to be more enthusiastic than that, ~name~. Try screaming <i>HEY!</i> at the top of your lungs!
-1-female_must_strip,target:nayru=shocked,I can't believe I get to see a real life goddess strip!
-1-female_must_strip,target:nayru=excited,Show us your golden body, Golden Goddess!
-1-female_must_strip,target:nayru=happy,I'm not sure if Link said this, but thanks for the magic spell you gave us back in Hyrule!
-1-female_must_strip,target:nayru=shocked,You look different than last time, Nayru. But I'm sure that's just the power of a god.
-1-female_must_strip,target:nayru=shy,I'm sure you don't need any hints, Nayru. Being a goddess and all...




#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

#fully clothed
0-male_removing_accessory=shocked,Oh! That's smart, I should remember that.
0-male_removing_accessory=puzzled,Maybe <i>I</i> should bring something extra next time?
0-male_removing_accessory=calm,If I had one hint to give you, it would be to not remove your ~clothing~.
0-male_removed_accessory=puzzled,Why does this game move so <i>slow</i>?
0-male_removed_accessory=happy,Oh boy! Next round!
0-male_removed_accessory=happy,<i>HEY!</i> Let's go! Poker waits for no fairy!
0-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m=calm,It's okay, Corrin. People have called <i>me</i> a pixie too.
0-female_removing_accessory=shocked,I should remember to wear lots of pointless items next time!
0-female_removing_accessory=happy,Come on, ~name~! The bigger the item, the more fun we have!
0-female_removing_accessory=cry,Where's your sense of adventure, ~name~?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=happy,Meia, allow me to introduce, Nayru, the Goddess of Wisdom and one third of the creators of Hyrule!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,targetStage:0=angry,It's my job to search for weaknesses, Meia. Anything to help ~player~ win.
0-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=happy,Well then, ~player~. It looks like it'll be a good time with Jura no matter what gender you picked!
0-female_removed_accessory=calm,Stocking cap, boots, tights... so many small items I could have brought.
0-female_removed_accessory=happy,Maybe if you had removed something bigger, you'd be as floaty as me!
0-female_removed_accessory=puzzled,I know accessories usually aren't that tight, but doesn't your spirit seem so much freer?


#lost light
1-male_removing_accessory=calm,If you want to last long in this game, try removing smaller items first.
1-male_removing_accessory=shy,There's nothing wrong with removing something small... I suppose.
1-male_removing_accessory=appreciative,I guess it doesn't matter what order you strip in, but insignificant items don't tend to get the best reactions.
1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,marker:dress=excited,Wow! I can't believe I found another person with wings and a dress, just like me!
1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,marker:problem=embarrassed,<i>HEY!</i> Do you have the same problem I do that people constantly look up your dress when flying?
1-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,marker:taunt=happy,Wait! I remember you from that one game we were in, ~name~! I was in Link's taunt!
1-male_removing_accessory,saidMarker:cards,marker:cards=calm,Remember the order is royal flush, straight flush, four of a kind, full house, flush...
1-male_removed_accessory=happy,Your ~clothing~! An excellent choice!
1-male_removed_accessory=interested,It's just one more item to reequip later.
1-male_removed_accessory=excited,Next round! I'm on a roll, now!
1-male_removed_accessory=interested,I'm sure they'll give your ~clothing~ back when this is over, ~name~.
1-male_removed_accessory=puzzled,Why does this game move so <i>slow</i>?
1-male_removed_accessory=happy,Oh boy! Next round!
1-male_removed_accessory=happy,<i>HEY!</i> Let's go! Poker waits for no fairy!
1-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m=calm,It's okay, Corrin. People have called <i>me</i> a pixie too.
1-male_removed_accessory,saidMarker:cards,notSaidMarker:cards2,marker:cards2=calm,...straight, three of a kind, two pair, one pair, and finally, high card.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,saidMarker:taunt=puzzled,But I remember you being a lot moodier and darker back then...
1-male_removed_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:1,saidMarker:taunt=puzzled,Although... you wore a lot more black in that game...
1-female_removing_accessory=horny,Show us what you're made of, ~name~.
1-female_removing_accessory=excited,Now's not the time to give up, ~name~!
1-female_removing_accessory=puzzled,Maybe I should have brought something like your ~clothing~.
1-female_removing_accessory=appreciative,I know people can get attached to items. Like Skull Kid, who got so attached to his mask that he went to the moon and back for it.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>HEY!</i> ~name~! Your ~clothing~ is burning away!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=puzzled,What kind of fire magic is this?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=interested,Did Din teach you fire magic too, ~name~?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=angry,You better not ask for cheat codes. We're not that type of game.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=appreciative,You don't to meet a lot of blue haired people in Hyrule, so it's always nice to meet another one.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=shocked,Wait! Is that the weapon you use to fight evil! Don't you have a sword of something?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>HEY!</i> Is that what you use to defeat evil? It doesn't even have a blade!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=appreciative,Nice work, ~player~. You'll be winning soon enough.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=embarrassed,Always remember to watch Kyu's movements carefully and <i>stay away</i> from her when her wings change their color.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=embarrassed,I can't believe a fairy like Kyu can wear so much white.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=angry,A quick warning to anyone who touches Kyu's clothes, if it squishes, burn it.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=shy,I mean it's absolutely fin that you're tall...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=loss,You being tall is absolutely fine, but...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=shy,Thank you, Spooky. It's just that, well...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=shocked,She's doing that thing again!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=shocked,How many different outfits did she bring?
1-female_removing_accessory,alsoPlaying:moon=interested,Remember the rules, ~name~. The ones specifically for you.
1-female_removing_accessory,alsoPlaying:moon=shy,I think you're getting a little <i>too</i> excited here, ~name~.
1-female_removing_accessory,alsoPlaying:moon=cry,D-do we <i>have</i> to see more of ~name~'s body?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=excited,Which sounds <i>really</i> great for a society of women...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=excited,Which sounds like a good deal for both him and the society of women...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=shy,Well, if I know anything about your type, ~name~. You either appreciate what I do or despise every moment I speak up.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru=puzzled,So, you instructed the Deku Tree about my mission. So that means you're like my boss' boss!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru=calm,I see you had to abandon some of your godly powers to make sure you don't win too easily. Smart.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru=excited,I knew a goddess like you would be smart enough to pick something small like your ~clothing~.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru=interested,If it isn't asking too much, can you tell me where I can get ~clothing~ just like yours?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0=puzzled,I tried to think of a helpful tip to give to people taking off their shoes...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=appreciative,They're called the Gerudo.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=appreciative,They go by, the Gerudo.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=shy,It was no master sword, but it's a shame that you have to lose your weapon.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1=cry,I suppose it was foolishly foolish of me to think you would take off something big, Mia.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=happy,Meia, allow me to introduce, Nayru, the Goddess of Wisdom and one third of the creators of Hyrule!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=shocked,Wait! Where are you going!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=shocked,Wait! We can leave?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1=interested,I've heard some interesting stories about inns from Link...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=excited,You know, the one sword with the spinning blade?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=appreciative,I think I'm growing to like you, ~name~. I like that you use shorter, punchier words to get your point across.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=puzzled,I feel like there's a really obvious joke to make here, but I just can't think of it.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=excited,The Great Deku Tree says, "Even the smallest among us, may hold the greatest value."
1-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan=cry,Not bats! I've been in too many dungeons to want to think about bats!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan=cry,Nobody cast any fire magic! Fire and bats don't mix well.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan=cry,I hate bats! They're tiny, flying, annoying little pests!
1-female_removed_accessory=appreciative,We've been doing this for quite a bit, remember to save before you take a break.
1-female_removed_accessory=interested,And so, the time of your ~clothing~ has passed.
1-female_removed_accessory=cry,Aww... no hidden secrets...
1-female_removed_accessory=shy,Not much of a puzzle, was it?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1a=shocked,<i>HEY!</i> Where did you get those clothes!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1a=shocked,<i>HEY!</i> This doesn't mean Link is walking around naked, does it?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen=angry,C'mon, ~player~. Are you going to let all of ~name~'s accessories get in the way of your triumphant victory?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen=appreciative,I'm so sorry you had to lose, Queen ~name~, but the game must go on.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen=shocked,Wow! I've seen princesses strip, but never a queen!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6=cry,I d-didn't expect you to look so d-different without your r-ribbon.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6=shy,<i>(Courage, Navi.)</i> I j-just didn't expect <i>monster girl</i> to be taken so <i>literally</i>.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6=puzzled,Is th-this what you meant by <i>monster girl</i>?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou=interested,I wish I had a jar, so I could catch some of those butterflies.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou=puzzled,Wait! Are those butterflies or other fairies?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou=puzzled,How do you get all those butterflies to stay in place? Link can barely catch one.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou=happy,Wow! That's actually really pretty!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2=appreciative,I mean... you're all tall to me.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2=puzzled,It'd be more surprising if there was someone <i>shorter</i> than me here.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2=shy,I'm not exactly the person to beat in terms of <i>height</i>...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=angry,Hey! You can't do that! That's cheating!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=puzzled,Well, this is different, but I guess it's what I did.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:6=shocked,Wait! The person in the disguise was a princess the whole time! I didn't see that coming!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=shocked,<i>WATCH OUT!</i> One magic transformation and she's a girl with blue hair? What kind of crazy world is this?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=shocked,Wait! What happened to your hair, ~name~? I mean, I like it more now, but still!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:6=interested,You look really nice with your hair down like that.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:6=appreciative,I think your hair looks better long and flowing.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=cry,Careful with the scarf! You might whip someone next time!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1=angry,...I didn't.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=puzzled,Actually, maybe it's better that you don't start swinging <i>that thing around here...</i>
1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=puzzled,I don't know. It just seems like a weird weapon to use.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=interested,I guess I've seen Link use both a stick and a slingshot, but a yo-yo is still really weird.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=excited,<i>HEY! LISTEN!</i> I might have a tendency to do that too.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru=shy,On to the next round. If... that's okay with you, ~name~.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru=shocked,She looks even more radiant without her ~clothing~!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru=appreciative,I know most gods go for something flashier, so it's nice to have a goddess who can do fine with a more... minimalist outfit.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru=embarrassed,Should I tell everyone that we met like this? It seems a little... <i>lewd.</i>
1-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena=shy,I'm  not saying that I don't think you're an <i>actual</i> goddess, but you did manage to lose to a simple fairy.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena=puzzled,<i>(Is ~name~ actually Farore in disguise? She does have the green hair and a lot of courage for coming here.)</i>
1-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena=puzzled,I swear I've seen Palutena somewhere else before. Somewhere with much less stripping.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena=puzzled,How many extra items are you <i>wearing</i>, ~name~.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena=shy,I know I shouldn't question a goddess, but isn't this a <i>little</i> excessive?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:3=calm,So many accessories... you truly are one of de best at this game, Mia.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1=shy,I'm pretty sure you were scaring ~player~. He hasn't said a word this whole game!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=calm,That's it.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=calm,I can't tell if this means I'm a better partner for ~player~ or if ~name~ is winning her own game?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=excited,Now just do that a few more times, ~player~, and you'll be bound to win!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=appreciative,Don't feel bad for ~name~, ~player~. I'm sure she's <i>enjoying this much more than you think she is</i>.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=puzzled,But wait... if ~player~ wins... then ~name~ proves her point, but... I also prove mine... hmmmm...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3=shocked,I think my eyes just freaked out for a second!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3=loss,I think I might have had too many milks before I came here, 'cause I keep seeing weird things.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=shy,Until it turns out that he turned out to be a being of pure evil who killed my boss...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=calm,They're nice enough, once you defeat them in combat that is.

1-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta=shy,It's nothing too crazy... just a hand... in a very, very strange place.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze=shocked,I can't believe it. It just turned to ash.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze=shocked,Wait! If your clothes keep exploding, what are you going to walk home in!

2-male_removing_accessory=shy,We're getting there... bit by bit.
2-male_removing_accessory=shocked,Quick! Somebody time him!
2-male_removing_accessory=shocked,It's the little things that matter the most... <i>WAIT! THAT ONE WASN'T ADVICE</i>!
2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,marker:dress=excited,Wow! I can't believe I found another person with wings and a dress, just like me!
2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,marker:problem=embarrassed,<i>HEY!</i> Do you have the same problem I do that people constantly look up your dress when flying?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,marker:taunt=happy,Wait! I remember you from that one game we were in, ~name~! I was in Link's taunt!
2-male_removing_accessory,saidMarker:cards,marker:cards=calm,Remember the order is royal flush, straight flush, four of a kind, full house, flush...
2-male_removed_accessory=happy,Remember, no matter what happens, you got to play a fun game today!
2-male_removed_accessory=appreciative,There's nothing wrong with having to take a small break.
2-male_removed_accessory=shy,I'm sure by this point you're really just skipping past my dialogue...
2-male_removed_accessory=puzzled,Why does this game move so <i>slow</i>?
2-male_removed_accessory=happy,Oh boy! Next round!
2-male_removed_accessory=happy,<i>HEY!</i> Let's go! Poker waits for no fairy!
2-male_removed_accessory,saidMarker:cards,notSaidMarker:cards2,marker:cards2=calm,...straight, three of a kind, two pair, one pair, and finally, high card.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m=calm,It's okay, Corrin. People have called <i>me</i> a pixie too.
2-female_removing_accessory=puzzled,Where are all these extra items coming from?
2-female_removing_accessory=interested,I should invite some of the other fairies next time!
2-female_removing_accessory=puzzled,You know, ~player~. I should really teach you the camera controls so that you can look around a bit more.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=appreciative,You don't to meet a lot of blue haired people in Hyrule, so it's always nice to meet another one.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=excited,Which sounds <i>really</i> great for a society of women...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=excited,Which sounds like a good deal for both him and the society of women...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=appreciative,Nice work, ~player~. You'll be winning soon enough.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=embarrassed,Always remember to watch Kyu's movements carefully and <i>stay away</i> from her when her wings change their color.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=embarrassed,I can't believe a fairy like Kyu can wear so much white.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=angry,A quick warning to anyone who touches Kyu's clothes, if it squishes, burn it.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=shy,Well, if I know anything about your type, ~name~. You either appreciate what I do or despise every moment I speak up.
2-female_removing_accessory,alsoPlaying:moon=interested,Remember the rules, ~name~. The ones specifically for you.
2-female_removing_accessory,alsoPlaying:moon=shy,I think you're getting a little <i>too</i> excited here, ~name~.
2-female_removing_accessory,alsoPlaying:moon=cry,D-do we <i>have</i> to see more of ~name~'s body?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=shy,I mean it's absolutely fin that you're tall...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=loss,You being tall is absolutely fine, but...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=shocked,Wait! Is that the weapon you use to fight evil! Don't you have a sword of something?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>HEY!</i> Is that what you use to defeat evil? It doesn't even have a blade!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=shy,Thank you, Spooky. It's just that, well...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=happy,Meia, allow me to introduce, Nayru, the Goddess of Wisdom and one third of the creators of Hyrule!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=angry,You better not ask for cheat codes. We're not that type of game.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>HEY!</i> ~name~! Your ~clothing~ is burning away!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=puzzled,What kind of fire magic is this?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=interested,Did Din teach you fire magic too, ~name~?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=puzzled,I feel like there's a really obvious joke to make here, but I just can't think of it.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru=puzzled,So, you instructed the Deku Tree about my mission. So that means you're like my boss' boss!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru=calm,I see you had to abandon some of your godly powers to make sure you don't win too easily. Smart.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru=excited,I knew a goddess like you would be smart enough to pick something small like your ~clothing~.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru=interested,If it isn't asking too much, can you tell me where I can get ~clothing~ just like yours?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=appreciative,I think I'm growing to like you, ~name~. I like that you use shorter, punchier words to get your point across.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=excited,The Great Deku Tree says, "Even the smallest among us, may hold the greatest value."
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1=interested,I've heard some interesting stories about inns from Link...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=appreciative,They're called the Gerudo.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=appreciative,They go by, the Gerudo.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1=cry,I suppose it was foolishly foolish of me to think you would take off something big, Mia.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=shocked,Wait! Where are you going!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=shocked,Wait! We can leave?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=shocked,She's doing that thing again!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=shocked,How many different outfits did she bring?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=shy,It was no master sword, but it's a shame that you have to lose your weapon.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=excited,You know, the one sword with the spinning blade?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=puzzled,Wait. Didn't you date that guy who owns the ranch?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0=puzzled,I tried to think of a helpful tip to give to people taking off their shoes...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan=cry,Not bats! I've been in too many dungeons to want to think about bats!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan=cry,Nobody cast any fire magic! Fire and bats don't mix well.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan=cry,I hate bats! They're tiny, flying, annoying little pests!
2-female_removed_accessory=cry,Playing this game is slower than traveling with Link before he got Epona.
2-female_removed_accessory=appreciative,More small items just means that we get to play for longer!
2-female_removed_accessory=excited,Fearless! Bold! Inspirational! All great words, but not ones I would use for you right now.
2-female_removed_accessory=shy,I think by now, ~player~, you know which button to press, but do you want a reminder anyways?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou=interested,I wish I had a jar, so I could catch some of those butterflies.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou=puzzled,Wait! Are those butterflies or other fairies?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou=puzzled,How do you get all those butterflies to stay in place? Link can barely catch one.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou=happy,Wow! That's actually really pretty!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1=shy,I'm pretty sure you were scaring ~player~. He hasn't said a word this whole game!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru=shy,On to the next round. If... that's okay with you, ~name~.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru=shocked,She looks even more radiant without her ~clothing~!

2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=puzzled,I don't know. It just seems like a weird weapon to use.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=interested,I guess I've seen Link use both a stick and a slingshot, but a yo-yo is still really weird.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=calm,They're nice enough, once you defeat them in combat that is.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=calm,That's it.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta=shy,It's nothing too crazy... just a hand... in a very, very strange place.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1=angry,...I didn't.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze=shocked,I can't believe it. It just turned to ash.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze=shocked,Wait! If your clothes keep exploding, what are you going to walk home in!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:6=shocked,Wait! The person in the disguise was a princess the whole time! I didn't see that coming!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy=puzzled,Wait... aren't you dating that <i>jerk</i> who took over Lon Lon ranch?

2-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=puzzled,Actually, maybe it's better that you don't start swinging <i>that thing around here...</i>
2-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=shocked,<i>WATCH OUT!</i> One magic transformation and she's a girl with blue hair? What kind of crazy world is this?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=shocked,Wait! What happened to your hair, ~name~? I mean, I like it more now, but still!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2=appreciative,I mean... you're all tall to me.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2=puzzled,It'd be more surprising if there was someone <i>shorter</i> than me here.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2=shy,I'm not exactly the person to beat in terms of <i>height</i>...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=angry,Hey! You can't do that! That's cheating!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=puzzled,Well, this is different, but I guess it's what I did.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3=shocked,I think my eyes just freaked out for a second!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3=loss,I think I might have had too many milks before I came here, 'cause I keep seeing weird things.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen=angry,C'mon, ~player~. Are you going to let all of ~name~'s accessories get in the way of your triumphant victory?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen=appreciative,I'm so sorry you had to lose, Queen ~name~, but the game must go on.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen=shocked,Wow! I've seen princesses strip, but never a queen!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:3=calm,So many accessories... you truly are one of de best at this game, Mia.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1a=shocked,<i>HEY!</i> Where did you get those clothes!

2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=shocked,Woah, you look pretty banged up, ~name~! Do you need some milk or something?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=shocked,Woah! She looks like she was hit head on with a deku nut.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=excited,<i>HEY! LISTEN!</i> I might have a tendency to do that too.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:6=interested,You look really nice with your hair down like that.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:6=appreciative,I think your hair looks better long and flowing.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=cry,Careful with the scarf! You might whip someone next time!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6=cry,I d-didn't expect you to look so d-different without your r-ribbon.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6=shy,<i>(Courage, Navi.)</i> I j-just didn't expect <i>monster girl</i> to be taken so <i>literally</i>.

-3-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=shocked,How many different outfits did she bring?
-3-female_removed_accessory=calm,It's always nicer when the jokes flow naturally rather than have us try and force them.
-3-female_removed_accessory=cry,Convincing you people to take off something important is harder than completing the water temple.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=calm,Are you okay, ~name~?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=shocked,Woah, you look pretty banged up, ~name~! Do you need some milk or something?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=shocked,Woah! She looks like she was hit head on with a deku nut.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze=shocked,I can't believe it. It just turned to ash.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze=shocked,Wait! If your clothes keep exploding, what are you going to walk home in!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,alsoPlaying:aimee,alsoPlayingStage:1-7,notSaidMarker:wait,marker:wait=shocked,You can't destroy your clothes! Talk some sense into her, Aimee! Wait... I forgot who I was talking to.

-3-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru=shy,On to the next round. If... that's okay with you, ~name~.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru=shocked,She looks even more radiant without her ~clothing~!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru=appreciative,I know most gods go for something flashier, so it's nice to have a goddess who can do fine with a more... minimalist outfit.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru=embarrassed,Should I tell everyone that we met like this? It seems a little... <i>lewd.</i>
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=excited,<i>HEY! LISTEN!</i> I might have a tendency to do that too.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena=shy,I'm  not saying that I don't think you're an <i>actual</i> goddess, but you did manage to lose to a simple fairy.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena=puzzled,<i>(Is ~name~ actually Farore in disguise? She does have the green hair and a lot of courage for coming here.)</i>
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena=puzzled,I swear I've seen Palutena somewhere else before. Somewhere with much less stripping.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena=puzzled,How many extra items are you <i>wearing</i>, ~name~.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena=shy,I know I shouldn't question a goddess, but isn't this a <i>little</i> excessive?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=shocked,<i>WATCH OUT!</i> One magic transformation and she's a girl with blue hair? What kind of crazy world is this?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=shocked,Wait! What happened to your hair, ~name~? I mean, I like it more now, but still!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3=shocked,I think my eyes just freaked out for a second!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3=loss,I think I might have had too many milks before I came here, 'cause I keep seeing weird things.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=angry,Hey! You can't do that! That's cheating!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=puzzled,Well, this is different, but I guess it's what I did.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou=interested,I wish I had a jar, so I could catch some of those butterflies.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou=puzzled,Wait! Are those butterflies or other fairies?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou=puzzled,How do you get all those butterflies to stay in place? Link can barely catch one.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou=happy,Wow! That's actually really pretty!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1=shy,I'm pretty sure you were scaring ~player~. He hasn't said a word this whole game!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2=appreciative,I mean... you're all tall to me.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2=puzzled,It'd be more surprising if there was someone <i>shorter</i> than me here.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2=shy,I'm not exactly the person to beat in terms of <i>height</i>...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6=cry,I d-didn't expect you to look so d-different without your r-ribbon.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6=shy,<i>(Courage, Navi.)</i> I j-just didn't expect <i>monster girl</i> to be taken so <i>literally</i>.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6=puzzled,Is th-this what you meant by <i>monster girl</i>?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen=angry,C'mon, ~player~. Are you going to let all of ~name~'s accessories get in the way of your triumphant victory?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen=appreciative,I'm so sorry you had to lose, Queen ~name~, but the game must go on.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen=shocked,Wow! I've seen princesses strip, but never a queen!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=puzzled,Actually, maybe it's better that you don't start swinging <i>that thing around here...</i>
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy=puzzled,Wait... aren't you dating that <i>jerk</i> who took over Lon Lon ranch?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy=excited,<i>HEY</i> I'm Navi!

-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:6=shocked,Wait! The person in the disguise was a princess the whole time! I didn't see that coming!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=calm,They're nice enough, once you defeat them in combat that is.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=shy,Until it turns out that he turned out to be a being of pure evil who killed my boss...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=calm,I can't tell if this means I'm a better partner for ~player~ or if ~name~ is winning her own game?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=excited,Now just do that a few more times, ~player~, and you'll be bound to win!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=appreciative,Don't feel bad for ~name~, ~player~. I'm sure she's <i>enjoying this much more than you think she is</i>.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=puzzled,But wait... if ~player~ wins... then ~name~ proves her point, but... I also prove mine... hmmmm...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=puzzled,I don't know. It just seems like a weird weapon to use.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=interested,I guess I've seen Link use both a stick and a slingshot, but a yo-yo is still really weird.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1=angry,...I didn't.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=cry,Careful with the scarf! You might whip someone next time!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:3=calm,So many accessories... you truly are one of de best at this game, Mia.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta=shy,It's nothing too crazy... just a hand... in a very, very strange place.

-3-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1a=shocked,<i>HEY!</i> This doesn't mean Link is walking around naked, does it?

-2-male_removing_accessory,target:pit,targetStage:0,marker:taunt=happy,Wait! I remember you from that one game we were in, ~name~! I was in Link's taunt!
-2-male_removed_accessory=excited,It's okay, ~name~. I'm a little superfluous too!
-2-male_removed_accessory=angry,Unless that gave you the ability to float, it probably wasn't that important anyways.
-2-male_removed_accessory=embarrassed,Usually, I'd be d-disappointed right now, but for some reason I just keep feeling this <i>weird</i> warm feeling instead.

-2-male_removed_accessory,saidMarker:cards,notSaidMarker:cards2,marker:cards2=calm,...straight, three of a kind, two pair, one pair, and finally, high card.
-2-female_removing_accessory=embarrassed,D-don't mind me... I'll just be... over here...
-2-female_removing_accessory=loss,Actually, if you had swapped your other card, maybe you wouldn't have to do <i>this.</i>
-2-female_removing_accessory=embarrassed,Ahhhh... I... I d-don't think I can p-pay much attention this r-round.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=appreciative,Nice work, ~player~. You'll be winning soon enough.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=embarrassed,Always remember to watch Kyu's movements carefully and <i>stay away</i> from her when her wings change their color.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=embarrassed,I can't believe a fairy like Kyu can wear so much white.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=angry,A quick warning to anyone who touches Kyu's clothes, if it squishes, burn it.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=puzzled,Wait. Didn't you date that guy who owns the ranch?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=excited,The Great Deku Tree says, "Even the smallest among us, may hold the greatest value."
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1=cry,I suppose it was foolishly foolish of me to think you would take off something big, Mia.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0=puzzled,I tried to think of a helpful tip to give to people taking off their shoes...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=shy,It was no master sword, but it's a shame that you have to lose your weapon.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=shy,Well, if I know anything about your type, ~name~. You either appreciate what I do or despise every moment I speak up.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=shy,I mean it's absolutely fin that you're tall...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=loss,You being tall is absolutely fine, but...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=shocked,Wait! Is that the weapon you use to fight evil! Don't you have a sword of something?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>HEY!</i> Is that what you use to defeat evil? It doesn't even have a blade!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=shocked,Wait! Where are you going!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=shocked,Wait! We can leave?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=excited,You know, the one sword with the spinning blade?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=excited,Which sounds <i>really</i> great for a society of women...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=excited,Which sounds like a good deal for both him and the society of women...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=angry,You better not ask for cheat codes. We're not that type of game.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:meia=happy,Meia, allow me to introduce, Nayru, the Goddess of Wisdom and one third of the creators of Hyrule!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan=cry,Not bats! I've been in too many dungeons to want to think about bats!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan=cry,Nobody cast any fire magic! Fire and bats don't mix well.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan=cry,I hate bats! They're tiny, flying, annoying little pests!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=appreciative,They're called the Gerudo.

-2-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=shy,Thank you, Spooky. It's just that, well...

-2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=shocked,How many different outfits did she bring?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru=puzzled,So, you instructed the Deku Tree about my mission. So that means you're like my boss' boss!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru=calm,I see you had to abandon some of your godly powers to make sure you don't win too easily. Smart.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru=excited,I knew a goddess like you would be smart enough to pick something small like your ~clothing~.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru=interested,If it isn't asking too much, can you tell me where I can get ~clothing~ just like yours?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=puzzled,I feel like there's a really obvious joke to make here, but I just can't think of it.

-2-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=appreciative,I think I'm growing to like you, ~name~. I like that you use shorter, punchier words to get your point across.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=appreciative,You don't to meet a lot of blue haired people in Hyrule, so it's always nice to meet another one.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1=interested,I've heard some interesting stories about inns from Link...
-2-female_removed_accessory=cry,You can't still be able to remove small items like that!
-2-female_removed_accessory=shocked,I can't believe you still have your ~clothing~ to give away!
-2-female_removed_accessory=shy,It's a shame that women don't use <i>visuals</i> as much as men do when... <i>doing this...</i>
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen=angry,C'mon, ~player~. Are you going to let all of ~name~'s accessories get in the way of your triumphant victory?

-1-female_removing_accessory,target:joey,targetStage:0=appreciative,You don't to meet a lot of blue haired people in Hyrule, so it's always nice to meet another one.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=shocked,Wait! Is that the weapon you use to fight evil! Don't you have a sword of something?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>HEY!</i> Is that what you use to defeat evil? It doesn't even have a blade!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:jenetta,targetStage:1=interested,I've heard some interesting stories about inns from Link...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0=puzzled,I tried to think of a helpful tip to give to people taking off their shoes...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1=cry,I suppose it was foolishly foolish of me to think you would take off something big, Mia.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=excited,The Great Deku Tree says, "Even the smallest among us, may hold the greatest value."
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=shy,I mean it's absolutely fin that you're tall...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:1=loss,You being tall is absolutely fine, but...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>HEY!</i> ~name~! Your ~clothing~ is burning away!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=puzzled,What kind of fire magic is this?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:0=interested,Did Din teach you fire magic too, ~name~?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:daisy,targetStage:3=puzzled,Wait. Didn't you date that guy who owns the ranch?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=excited,Which sounds <i>really</i> great for a society of women...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=excited,Which sounds like a good deal for both him and the society of women...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=appreciative,I think I'm growing to like you, ~name~. I like that you use shorter, punchier words to get your point across.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:0=puzzled,I feel like there's a really obvious joke to make here, but I just can't think of it.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan=cry,Not bats! I've been in too many dungeons to want to think about bats!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan=cry,Nobody cast any fire magic! Fire and bats don't mix well.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan=cry,I hate bats! They're tiny, flying, annoying little pests!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:1=excited,You know, the one sword with the spinning blade?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=angry,You better not ask for cheat codes. We're not that type of game.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:0=shy,Thank you, Spooky. It's just that, well...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru=puzzled,So, you instructed the Deku Tree about my mission. So that means you're like my boss' boss!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru=calm,I see you had to abandon some of your godly powers to make sure you don't win too easily. Smart.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru=excited,I knew a goddess like you would be smart enough to pick something small like your ~clothing~.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:nayru=interested,If it isn't asking too much, can you tell me where I can get ~clothing~ just like yours?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=shocked,She's doing that thing again!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=shocked,How many different outfits did she bring?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=appreciative,Nice work, ~player~. You'll be winning soon enough.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=embarrassed,Always remember to watch Kyu's movements carefully and <i>stay away</i> from her when her wings change their color.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=embarrassed,I can't believe a fairy like Kyu can wear so much white.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=angry,A quick warning to anyone who touches Kyu's clothes, if it squishes, burn it.
-1-female_removing_accessory,alsoPlaying:moon=interested,Remember the rules, ~name~. The ones specifically for you.
-1-female_removing_accessory,alsoPlaying:moon=shy,I think you're getting a little <i>too</i> excited here, ~name~.
-1-female_removing_accessory,alsoPlaying:moon=cry,D-do we <i>have</i> to see more of ~name~'s body?
-1-female_removed_accessory=shy,It's just that when I'm with Link, the burden of conversation usually falls on me.
-1-female_removed_accessory=shy,It's just when I'm adventuring with Link, the banter doesn't usually <i>go both ways.</i>
-1-female_removed_accessory=interested,It's an old habit from trying to continue on conversations with Link.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jasmine,targetStage:6=shocked,Wait! The person in the disguise was a princess the whole time! I didn't see that coming!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=puzzled,I don't know. It just seems like a weird weapon to use.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=interested,I guess I've seen Link use both a stick and a slingshot, but a yo-yo is still really weird.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=shocked,<i>WATCH OUT!</i> One magic transformation and she's a girl with blue hair? What kind of crazy world is this?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:launch,targetStage:2=shocked,Wait! What happened to your hair, ~name~? I mean, I like it more now, but still!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:rinkah,targetStage:1=calm,That's it.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru=shy,On to the next round. If... that's okay with you, ~name~.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru=shocked,She looks even more radiant without her ~clothing~!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru=appreciative,I know most gods go for something flashier, so it's nice to have a goddess who can do fine with a more... minimalist outfit.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:nayru=embarrassed,Should I tell everyone that we met like this? It seems a little... <i>lewd.</i>
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6=cry,I d-didn't expect you to look so d-different without your r-ribbon.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6=shy,<i>(Courage, Navi.)</i> I j-just didn't expect <i>monster girl</i> to be taken so <i>literally</i>.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:alice_mgq,targetStage:6=puzzled,Is th-this what you meant by <i>monster girl</i>?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:spooky,targetStage:1=shy,I'm pretty sure you were scaring ~player~. He hasn't said a word this whole game!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=shy,Until it turns out that he turned out to be a being of pure evil who killed my boss...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena=shy,I'm  not saying that I don't think you're an <i>actual</i> goddess, but you did manage to lose to a simple fairy.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena=puzzled,<i>(Is ~name~ actually Farore in disguise? She does have the green hair and a lot of courage for coming here.)</i>
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena=puzzled,I swear I've seen Palutena somewhere else before. Somewhere with much less stripping.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena=puzzled,How many extra items are you <i>wearing</i>, ~name~.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena=shy,I know I shouldn't question a goddess, but isn't this a <i>little</i> excessive?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=calm,They're nice enough, once you defeat them in combat that is.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2=appreciative,I mean... you're all tall to me.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2=puzzled,It'd be more surprising if there was someone <i>shorter</i> than me here.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:aella,targetStage:2=shy,I'm not exactly the person to beat in terms of <i>height</i>...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy=puzzled,Wait... aren't you dating that <i>jerk</i> who took over Lon Lon ranch?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:daisy=excited,<i>HEY</i> I'm Navi!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1a=shocked,<i>HEY!</i> Where did you get those clothes!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:1a=shocked,<i>HEY!</i> This doesn't mean Link is walking around naked, does it?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze=shocked,I can't believe it. It just turned to ash.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze=shocked,Wait! If your clothes keep exploding, what are you going to walk home in!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jenetta=shy,It's nothing too crazy... just a hand... in a very, very strange place.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=calm,Are you okay, ~name~?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=shocked,Woah, you look pretty banged up, ~name~! Do you need some milk or something?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:dizzy=shocked,Woah! She looks like she was hit head on with a deku nut.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:4=excited,<i>HEY! LISTEN!</i> I might have a tendency to do that too.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:6=interested,You look really nice with your hair down like that.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:6=appreciative,I think your hair looks better long and flowing.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=calm,I can't tell if this means I'm a better partner for ~player~ or if ~name~ is winning her own game?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=excited,Now just do that a few more times, ~player~, and you'll be bound to win!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=appreciative,Don't feel bad for ~name~, ~player~. I'm sure she's <i>enjoying this much more than you think she is</i>.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,priority:500=puzzled,But wait... if ~player~ wins... then ~name~ proves her point, but... I also prove mine... hmmmm...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=puzzled,Actually, maybe it's better that you don't start swinging <i>that thing around here...</i>
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=cry,Careful with the scarf! You might whip someone next time!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1=angry,...I didn't.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou=interested,I wish I had a jar, so I could catch some of those butterflies.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou=puzzled,Wait! Are those butterflies or other fairies?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou=puzzled,How do you get all those butterflies to stay in place? Link can barely catch one.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:zizou=happy,Wow! That's actually really pretty!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:3=calm,So many accessories... you truly are one of de best at this game, Mia.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,alsoPlaying:aimee,alsoPlayingStage:1-7,notSaidMarker:wait,marker:wait=shocked,You can't destroy your clothes! Talk some sense into her, Aimee! Wait... I forgot who I was talking to.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:shimakaze,alsoPlaying:aimee,alsoPlayingStage:1-7,notSaidMarker:wait,marker:wait=shy,What are you going to walk home in? Aimee, tell her this is a bad idea. Wait... never mind, Aimee.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3=shocked,I think my eyes just freaked out for a second!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3=loss,I think I might have had too many milks before I came here, 'cause I keep seeing weird things.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen=angry,C'mon, ~player~. Are you going to let all of ~name~'s accessories get in the way of your triumphant victory?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen=appreciative,I'm so sorry you had to lose, Queen ~name~, but the game must go on.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:arwen=shocked,Wow! I've seen princesses strip, but never a queen!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=angry,Hey! You can't do that! That's cheating!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:vriska,targetStage:1=puzzled,Well, this is different, but I guess it's what I did.

1-male_removing_minor=appreciative,As a fairy, I know there are plenty of things you can live without. Such as your ~clothing~.
1-male_removing_minor=interested,Listen! You can hear everyone's bated breath.
1-male_removing_minor=excited,I'm not <i>extremely</i> excited for this round. I'm only <i>fairy-ly</i> excited.
1-male_removing_minor=embarrassed,Don't worry, I won't watch. Okay... I <i>might</i> watch.
1-male_removing_minor,target:link=interested,Since our current stripper isn't much of a talker, I'll try filling in for him.
1-male_removing_minor,target:link=interested,Don't worry, I'll fill in with my best Link impression.
1-male_removing_minor,target:link=calm,I'm used to Link's lack of voice, so I'll translate. <i>*Ahem*</i>
1-male_removed_minor=excited,Look, look, ~player~. You can already see how close I am to winning!
1-male_removed_minor=angry,This is where the <i>real</i> adventure begins.
1-male_removed_minor=happy,Consider yourself a Dodongo, because I bet you don't like getting smoked!
1-male_removed_minor=excited,My heart's beating faster than my wings!
1-male_removed_minor,target:pit=happy,Careful, the floor's a little cold, you should just fly above it instead!
1-male_removed_minor,target:pit=puzzled,I've been meaning to ask, ~name~, why aren't you flying around like me instead of having to stay on the cold ground?
1-male_removed_minor,target:link=embarrassed,*ahem* <i>Oh no! Not my ~clothing~!</i>
1-male_removed_minor,target:link=cry,*ahem* <i>I should have saved first.</i>
1-male_removed_minor,target:link=cry,*ahem* <i>This is more embarrassing than that time I died to cuccos... or the other time... or the other time...</i>
1-male_removed_minor,target:link=appreciative,*ahem* <i>I would never have lost this round if I had my best partner and greatest friend of all time, Navi, at my side.</i>
1-female_removing_minor=interested,You never know what's around the corner!
1-female_removing_minor=embarrassed,Aww... you don't need your ~clothing~ anyways.
1-female_removing_minor=shy,I like your ~clothing~, ~name~. Of course, if everything you wore was completely blue...
1-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=happy,Looks like Kyu can't talk for a bit. Wonderful!
1-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=interested,I wonder if there's any way to <i>keep</i> that glove in her mouth?
1-female_removing_minor,target:nayru=interested,Get going Miss Goddess, wouldn't want to make your subjects unhappy!
1-female_removing_minor,target:nayru=interested,It's nice that you're trying to give ~player~ a chance for my sake.
1-female_removing_minor,target:nayru=angry,~player~! Thank ~name~ for allowing you to survive another round.
1-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3,targetSaidMarker:innuendo=excited,That's right! Kyu can also keep talking and ruin the reputation of fairy kind!
1-female_removing_minor,target:aimee=cry,Duck! Roll! Sidestep! Just get out of the way!
1-female_removing_minor,target:aimee=cry,What kind of fire magic is this?
1-female_removing_minor,target:aimee=cry,Why can't you just strip like everyone else!
1-female_removing_minor,target:aimee=cry,Please! I don't have that much health left!
1-female_removing_minor,target:aimee=cry,Hey! I <i>don't</i> turn out to be evil! I promise!
1-female_removing_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:2=puzzled,Do you always wear armor when you go out to things, Corrin?
1-female_removing_minor,target:alpha,saidMarker:roll,notSaidMarker:roll2,marker:roll2=calm,...as it rolls arooouund and arooouund...
1-female_removing_minor,target:aella,targetStage:2=shy,Link and I go into dungeon after dungeon on our adventures and I was just wondering...
1-female_removing_minor,target:miko,targetStage:0=shocked,<i>HEY!</i> Who's that weird ghost looking girl, Miko?
1-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2=angry,~player~ would never enjoy something like <i>that</i>!
1-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2=embarrassed,No Kyu, ~player~ is not into that. You're projecting, again.
1-female_removing_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:2=angry,I'm not even entirely sure what you're suggesting, but I can assure you, ~player~ is not <i>into that</i>!
1-female_removing_minor,notSaidMarker:shot,marker:hook=puzzled,Y'know, there aren't many things that are cooler than Link's hookshot...
1-female_removing_minor,target:rarity,targetStage:1=puzzled,Come to think of it, having an Equestria Girl come in and switch outfits every turn is kinda weird. You could say it's...
1-female_removing_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,saidMarker:picture,notSaidMarker:picture2,marker:picture2=shy,So, I figured that maybe you could take one of me, now.
1-female_removing_minor,target:jolyne,targetStage:1=appreciative,The Gerudo locked us up for trespassing, but it was really easy to get out.
1-female_removed_minor=happy,Oh boy! Next round!
1-female_removed_minor=interested,Don't you feel so much lighter, ~name~?
1-female_removed_minor=angry,What the H-E-double deku sticks was that?
1-female_removed_minor=angry,No offense, but keep removing stuff like that and people will be less expressive than a redead.
1-female_removed_minor,target:clover,marker:clover_dice=happy,Cheer up, ~name~. You rolled snake eyes this turn, but I'm sure the next time will be your ace in the hole!
1-female_removed_minor,target:clover,marker:clover_puzzle=interested,If you need any extra help on solving puzzles in rooms, ~name~, <i>I think I know a guy</i>.
1-female_removed_minor,target:clover,marker:clover_luck=embarrassed,It looks like ~name~'s going to need a little extra luck.
1-female_removed_minor,target:aella,targetStage:3=excited,It's amazing to meet a fellow adventurer!
1-female_removed_minor,target:aella,targetStage:3=excited,Wow, Aella! It's great to finally be with another adventurer!
1-female_removed_minor,target:jolyne,targetStage:2=angry,Life in prison... it <i>changes</i> a fairy...
1-female_removed_minor,target:catria,targetStage:4=shy,I think I might need a breast plate like that, too...

1-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:innuendo=happy,Oh, I'm sure there's a joke in this game, <i>Kyu</i>. I'm very sure...
1-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=happy,Is everyone happy now? I'm sure Kyu is.
1-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:3=interested,Let's hurry to the next round. I'm not sure that the our <i>other</i> can <i>keep it in her socks.</i>
1-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=puzzled,What did you do, ~name~? Touch the lava in Death Mountain!
1-female_removed_minor,target:nayru=happy,It's a shame that you had to lose such a beautiful garment, ~name~.
1-female_removed_minor,target:nayru=shocked,Your dress is so pretty! I wish that I could own something like that!
1-female_removed_minor,target:nayru=appreciative,I'm sure a goddess such as yourself has more tunics than I could ever imagine.
1-female_removed_minor,saidMarker:hook,notSaidMarker:shot,marker:shot=interested,I've only been able to think of one thing and it's a long shot!
1-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4=happy,Leave the meta commentary to the helpful characters, Kyu.
1-female_removed_minor,target:kyu,targetStage:4=appreciative,Check your controller, ~player~. Maybe there's a button that can turn off Kyu's <i>delightful</i> meta commentary.
1-female_removed_minor,target:misato=puzzled,Is that a scar? I'm not used to battle damage being a factor.
1-female_removed_minor,target:misato=shocked,Woah! A scar! Don't worry, a couple of fairies and some milk and we'll have you good as new!
1-female_removed_minor,target:corrin_f,targetStage:3=puzzled,Armor just doesn't seem like the kind of thing you should be wearing to something like <i>this</i>...
1-female_removed_minor,target:miko,targetStage:1=angry,I'm asking the same question! Who's she?
1-female_removed_minor,target:mahiru,targetStage:3,saidMarker:picture2=happy,And then you can show it off to everybody!

#OPPONENT REMOVING MAJOR CLOTHING
#Major clothing reveals a significant amount of skin and likely underwear.
#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

#fully clothed
0-male_removing_major=happy,Now this should be an adventure!
0-male_removing_major=puzzled,What? Are you waiting for the Moon to fall?

1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:spooky=cry,<i>WAIT!</i> I meant because you're a ghost who levitates! Not because of your <i>size</i>.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chiaki=angry,This is <i>not</i> the best game to be in with low health.
1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chiaki=horny,Remind me to tell you that you've only got two hits left, Chiaki, but <i>in a minute...</i>
1-female_small_chest_is_visible=appreciative,(Thank the Golden Goddesses I'm not the only one.)
1-female_small_chest_is_visible=excited,I think they're perfect just how they are!
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki=happy,Our time will come eventually, ~name~.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki=angry,The world just isn't ready for <i>chests</i> like ours, ~name~.
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=horny,You may no longer have your ~clothing~, but I'm sure the rest of your team will always support you!
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=interested,Getting a little red, aren't we ~name~?
1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky=cry,I would never say something like that. We're basically blue-skinned sisters in <i>that</i> department.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=happy,The real evil is that you would feel shame with <i>those</i> breasts!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible=calm,Very worthy.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:ini=angry,I didn't like being tricked, Ini, but I do have some respect for how much effort you put into your stupidity.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru=shocked,Are y-you okay, ~name~? Are you having an off day?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru=shocked,You've lost quite a bit, ~name~. Is something wrong?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru=horny,I did not think that a goddess would be showing me her breasts, but here we are.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,notSaidMarker:trick,marker:trick=horny,Woah! What a wonderful bit of magic!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,notSaidMarker:trick,marker:trick=puzzled,Was that supposed to happen?
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aella=excited,It's okay, ~name~. I'm here without a bra too!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aella=excited,It's alright to have come braless. I did the same!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:clover,marker:clover_cloverless=horny,There go ~name~'s clovers...
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:arwen=embarrassed,Y-your majesty...
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:arwen=embarrassed,Your skin shines so majestically against your black hair...
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sanako=shy,Your... <i>womanly ways</i> look really nice, Sanako.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=loss,That's a little too close for comfort!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=shocked,Did you get hurt? I have some milk if you need it!
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=angry,The moment I'm sure ~player~ has been waiting far too long for.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=appreciative,Phew. Now you can finally get rid of that sweaty thing.
1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=embarrassed,I know you were a little sweaty, ~name~, so hopefully the breeze from my wings doesn't <i>you know. Since they're uncovered now...</i>
1-female_large_chest_is_visible=puzzled,Those are a lot less... pointy... than I thought they'd be.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible=shocked,Woah! What kind of magic makes <i>that</i> happen?
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena=interested,With all her human supporters, I guess ~name~ didn't feel the need for a bra.
1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:mia=shocked,Woah! I guess today, we play <i>your</i> way!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=excited,There's no turning back now!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=embarrassed,I can't even imagine...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,notSaidMarker:field,marker:field=calm,It's probably going to look like Hyrule Field.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:remilia=shocked,Where did all those-!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru=puzzled,Wait a minute...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru=puzzled,Hold on a second...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:arwen=shy,Kind of makes you wish you could just... turn invisible. Right, ~name~?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:arwen=angry,I'm sorry, ~name~, there's no cheat code or magic item to get you out of this one.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:arwen=shy,It could be worse, ~name~. There could be some looming presence that watches our every move and rea- <i>*cough* listens</i> to every word we say.
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight=puzzled,What goddess determined that order?
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=angry,It's always bad when the person with the weapon makes a mistake...
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=loss,Wait! Something's wrong!
1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=cry,Why didn't you use your z-targeting, Aimee?
1-female_crotch_is_visible=cry,I w-won't have to do that... right?
1-female_crotch_is_visible=embarrassed,This could be good information... for... later...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jolyne=shocked,It seems Jolyne doesn't have all of her *necessary items*.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jolyne=embarrassed,I'd give you a hint, Joylne, but I think you already know what went wrong...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=embarrassed,Oh... it seems to have... hmmm...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=shy,That... <i>didn't seem planned...</i>
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=shocked,That's an interesting choice, ~name~. Way to shake things up!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=happy,<i>WATCH OUT!</i> ~name~'s going off the books!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mahiru=shocked,I can't believe you decided to keep your camera for so long!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mahiru=excited,It takes a lot of courage to be where you are, ~name~ and to still keep an important item by your side.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:remilia=embarrassed,I... don't think that's how that's supposed to happen...
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy=shocked,Oh no! Looks like your leotard got ripped in that fight!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru=angry,You aren't the <i>real</i> Nayru!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru=angry,You aren't an actual goddess!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=shocked,You aren't going to shave your head next time you lose? It's so lush and <i>blue</i>!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=shy,I'm sure <i>someone</i> could think of a joke for this moment, but I can't think of anything.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elaine=embarrassed,What's that weird mark on your... your... um... <i>rear</i>?
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=loss,Oh no! It looks like you've been infected with Ganondorf's evil!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=cry,It smells worse than the inside of Jabu Jabu!
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=loss,Not even the Great King of Evil himself, frightens me as much as whatever ~name~ has just shown us.
1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=loss,I can't believe the number of horrifying moons that Link has seen is so long that we've had to start a list.


#lost dress
2-male_chest_will_be_visible=embarrassed,I bet there's going to be... um... more skin?
2-male_chest_will_be_visible=puzzled,Men... don't have breasts... <i>do they</i>?
2-male_chest_will_be_visible,target:9s=excited,I've become an expert on male anatomy for this game, so let's see that chest, ~name~!

2-male_chest_is_visible=shocked,So <i>that's</i> what you look like under there!
2-male_chest_is_visible=angry,I feel like Link's been holding out on me!
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:link,targetStage:4=angry,Great! This is why they didn't want me back for that mask game, you know!
2-male_chest_is_visible,target:link,targetStage:4=cry,Please, Nintendo! He doesn't know what he's doing! I'll get him to be quiet, just let me be in a game, please!

2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:link=shy,I know this is a very big moment for you, Link, but wouldn't it be better if you took it all in, <i>silently?</i>
2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:link=cry,Enough with the build up! Do you know what happens to fairies like me on the mean streets of Kakariko village?
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible=interested,Okay... so there are three small <i>things</i> down there.
2-male_small_crotch_is_visible=horny,Wow... so that's what it looks like...
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=puzzled,Sooo... they aren't <i>actually</i> nuts, right?
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=shocked,Wait! Link rides a horse with one of <i>those</i> between his legs.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=shocked,<i>WAIT</i> Angels have those things too! Do angels even <i>need</i> them?
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:link=angry,Great! It's all out there, but we don't have to talk about it <i>at all</i>.
2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:link=angry,He just keeps <i>talking and talking</i>! Honestly, who talks this much? It's starting to get really annoying.
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=cry,Watch out! You could hurt someone with that <i>thing</i>
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=loss,Are they <i>all that big?</i>
2-male_large_crotch_is_visible,target:el_shaggy_blanco=cry,<i>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</i>
2-female_chest_will_be_visible=appreciative,Great! Now we can be revealed together!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible=shy,Remember to remove your ~clothing~ slowly and keep focused.
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=cry,<i>What is this?</i>
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=cry,<i>AAAAAAHHHH!</i> What kind of weapon is this?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=cry,<i>AAAAHHH!</i> I don't think you can reflect these with a sword!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=cry,I don't like having this much anticipation!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=interested,I hope she had the gyroscope controls turned on...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=shy,This much waiting can never lead to something good...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=interested,That's... an interesting way to strip, ~name~. Try not to clip something...
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,notSaidMarker:treat,marker:treat=excited,Oh boy! A magic demonstration! I love those!
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nayru=interested,It's a shame you had to lose, ~name~, but we do get to see your breasts in exchange.

2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:arwen=embarrassed,Take your time, ~name~. After all, don't elves live to eternity?
2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chiaki=angry,This is <i>not</i> the best game to be in with low health.

2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mia=angry,...Finally, you just couldn't resist, could you, Mia?
2-female_small_chest_is_visible=embarrassed,It's okay. I know lots of people whose bodies don't develop with time.

-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nayru=puzzled,I can't believe your future sight didn't account for this, ~name~.
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mia=angry,...Finally, you just couldn't resist, could you, Mia?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=cry,<i>What is this?</i>
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=cry,<i>AAAAAAHHHH!</i> What kind of weapon is this?
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=cry,<i>AAAAHHH!</i> I don't think you can reflect these with a sword!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=cry,I don't like having this much anticipation!
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=interested,I hope she had the gyroscope controls turned on...
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=shy,This much waiting can never lead to something good...
-3-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=interested,That's... an interesting way to strip, ~name~. Try not to clip something...
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible=interested,I'm sure well all hope for <i>greater things</i> to come one day...
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible=excited,Well at least we can be topless together!
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=horny,You may no longer have your ~clothing~, but I'm sure the rest of your team will always support you!
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=interested,Getting a little red, aren't we ~name~?
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky=cry,I would never say something like that. We're basically blue-skinned sisters in <i>that</i> department.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki=happy,Our time will come eventually, ~name~.
-3-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki=angry,The world just isn't ready for <i>chests</i> like ours, ~name~.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru=shocked,Are y-you okay, ~name~? Are you having an off day?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru=shocked,You've lost quite a bit, ~name~. Is something wrong?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru=horny,I did not think that a goddess would be showing me her breasts, but here we are.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sanako=shy,Your... <i>womanly ways</i> look really nice, Sanako.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:clover,marker:clover_cloverless=horny,There go ~name~'s clovers...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=angry,The moment I'm sure ~player~ has been waiting far too long for.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=appreciative,Phew. Now you can finally get rid of that sweaty thing.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=embarrassed,I know you were a little sweaty, ~name~, so hopefully the breeze from my wings doesn't <i>you know. Since they're uncovered now...</i>
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:arwen=embarrassed,Y-your majesty...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:arwen=embarrassed,Your skin shines so majestically against your black hair...
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:ini=angry,I didn't like being tricked, Ini, but I do have some respect for how much effort you put into your stupidity.
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,notSaidMarker:trick,marker:trick=horny,Woah! What a wonderful bit of magic!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,notSaidMarker:trick,marker:trick=puzzled,Was that supposed to happen?
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=loss,That's a little too close for comfort!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=shocked,Did you get hurt? I have some milk if you need it!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aella=excited,It's okay, ~name~. I'm here without a bra too!
-3-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aella=excited,It's alright to have come braless. I did the same!
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible=shocked,Wow... that's quite a pair...
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible=embarrassed,It's so hard to keep track of two large targets at the same time...
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena=interested,With all her human supporters, I guess ~name~ didn't feel the need for a bra.
-3-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:mia=shocked,Woah! I guess today, we play <i>your</i> way!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=angry,Be careful not to touch it!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=shy,I wouldn't cover up... people may get testy...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible=excited,Nothing wrong with revealing your natural beauty!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,notSaidMarker:field,marker:field=calm,It's probably going to look like Hyrule Field.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:arwen=shy,Kind of makes you wish you could just... turn invisible. Right, ~name~?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:arwen=angry,I'm sorry, ~name~, there's no cheat code or magic item to get you out of this one.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:arwen=shy,It could be worse, ~name~. There could be some looming presence that watches our every move and rea- <i>*cough* listens</i> to every word we say.
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:remilia=shocked,Where did all those-!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru=puzzled,Wait a minute...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru=puzzled,Hold on a second...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=angry,It's always bad when the person with the weapon makes a mistake...
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=loss,Wait! Something's wrong!
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=cry,Why didn't you use your z-targeting, Aimee?
-3-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight=puzzled,What goddess determined that order?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible=shy,At least it's not a rough surface. Link tends to try to climb those...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible=shy,Just... don't offer to compare...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:remilia=embarrassed,I... don't think that's how that's supposed to happen...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru=angry,You aren't the <i>real</i> Nayru!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru=angry,You aren't an actual goddess!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jolyne=shocked,It seems Jolyne doesn't have all of her *necessary items*.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jolyne=embarrassed,I'd give you a hint, Joylne, but I think you already know what went wrong...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=loss,Oh no! It looks like you've been infected with Ganondorf's evil!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=cry,It smells worse than the inside of Jabu Jabu!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=loss,Not even the Great King of Evil himself, frightens me as much as whatever ~name~ has just shown us.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=loss,I can't believe the number of horrifying moons that Link has seen is so long that we've had to start a list.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mahiru=shocked,I can't believe you decided to keep your camera for so long!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mahiru=excited,It takes a lot of courage to be where you are, ~name~ and to still keep an important item by your side.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=shocked,That's an interesting choice, ~name~. Way to shake things up!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=happy,<i>WATCH OUT!</i> ~name~'s going off the books!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=shocked,You aren't going to shave your head next time you lose? It's so lush and <i>blue</i>!
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=shy,I'm sure <i>someone</i> could think of a joke for this moment, but I can't think of anything.
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=embarrassed,Oh... it seems to have... hmmm...
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=shy,That... <i>didn't seem planned...</i>
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elaine=embarrassed,What's that weird mark on your... your... um... <i>rear</i>?
-3-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy=shocked,Oh no! Looks like your leotard got ripped in that fight!

-2-male_chest_will_be_visible=shocked,I can't believe ~name~ removing his ~clothing~ isn't the most embarrassing thing done today!
-2-male_chest_will_be_visible=embarrassed,I think my stomach just grew its own pair of wings.

-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:link=shy,I know this is a very big moment for you, Link, but wouldn't it be better if you took it all in, <i>silently?</i>
-2-male_crotch_will_be_visible,target:link=cry,Enough with the build up! Do you know what happens to fairies like me on the mean streets of Kakariko village?
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible=calm,Well... things do come in all sorts of sizes. Me, for instance.
-2-male_small_crotch_is_visible=horny,Well, small keys can open a lot of locks.
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible=embarrassed,<i>(Calm down, Navi. ~name~ is gonna need hints and it's up to you to give them.)</i>

-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:link=angry,He just keeps <i>talking and talking</i>! Honestly, who talks this much? It's starting to get really annoying.
-2-male_medium_crotch_is_visible,target:pit=shocked,<i>WAIT</i> Angels have those things too! Do angels even <i>need</i> them?
-2-male_large_crotch_is_visible=shocked,How would you even get your hand around that thing!

-2-female_chest_will_be_visible=interested,Doesn't matter how many times it happens... I'll never get used to it.
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible=embarrassed,I'd cover my eyes if you needed the privacy, but... y'know...
-2-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nayru=interested,It's a shame you had to lose, ~name~, but we do get to see your breasts in exchange.

-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:chiaki=horny,Remind me to tell you that you've only got two hits left, Chiaki, but <i>in a minute...</i>
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:arwen=interested,While I hate to see royalty lose <i>like this</i>, I also am a <i>little bit</i> excited.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:arwen=embarrassed,Take your time, ~name~. After all, don't elves live to eternity?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nayru=interested,It's a shame you had to lose, ~name~, but we do get to see your breasts in exchange.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nayru=embarrassed,You're too... generous, ~name~.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:nayru=puzzled,I can't believe your future sight didn't account for this, ~name~.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:mia=angry,...Finally, you just couldn't resist, could you, Mia?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,notSaidMarker:treat,marker:treat=excited,Oh boy! A magic demonstration! I love those!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:spooky=cry,<i>WAIT!</i> I meant because you're a ghost who levitates! Not because of your <i>size</i>.
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:felicia=interested,That's... an interesting way to strip, ~name~. Try not to clip something...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=cry,<i>What is this?</i>
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=cry,<i>AAAAAAHHHH!</i> What kind of weapon is this?
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=cry,<i>AAAAHHH!</i> I don't think you can reflect these with a sword!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=cry,I don't like having this much anticipation!
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=interested,I hope she had the gyroscope controls turned on...
-1-female_chest_will_be_visible,target:aimee=shy,This much waiting can never lead to something good...
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible=embarrassed,I hope the cold breeze from my wings doesn't... oh... too late...
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible=embarrassed,At least you were honest enough that they looked this size before you took off your ~clothing~.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:spooky=cry,I would never say something like that. We're basically blue-skinned sisters in <i>that</i> department.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=horny,You may no longer have your ~clothing~, but I'm sure the rest of your team will always support you!
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=interested,Getting a little red, aren't we ~name~?
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki=happy,Our time will come eventually, ~name~.
-1-female_small_chest_is_visible,target:natsuki=angry,The world just isn't ready for <i>chests</i> like ours, ~name~.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru=shocked,Are y-you okay, ~name~? Are you having an off day?
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru=shocked,You've lost quite a bit, ~name~. Is something wrong?
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:nayru=horny,I did not think that a goddess would be showing me her breasts, but here we are.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:ini=angry,I didn't like being tricked, Ini, but I do have some respect for how much effort you put into your stupidity.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=angry,The moment I'm sure ~player~ has been waiting far too long for.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=appreciative,Phew. Now you can finally get rid of that sweaty thing.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=embarrassed,I know you were a little sweaty, ~name~, so hopefully the breeze from my wings doesn't <i>you know. Since they're uncovered now...</i>
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:sanako=shy,Your... <i>womanly ways</i> look really nice, Sanako.
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,notSaidMarker:trick,marker:trick=horny,Woah! What a wonderful bit of magic!
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:joey,notSaidMarker:trick,marker:trick=puzzled,Was that supposed to happen?
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:clover,marker:clover_cloverless=horny,There go ~name~'s clovers...
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:arwen=embarrassed,Y-your majesty...
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:arwen=embarrassed,Your skin shines so majestically against your black hair...
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=loss,That's a little too close for comfort!
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aimee=shocked,Did you get hurt? I have some milk if you need it!
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aella=excited,It's okay, ~name~. I'm here without a bra too!
-1-female_medium_chest_is_visible,target:aella=excited,It's alright to have come braless. I did the same!
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible=shocked,I don't think I could even leave the ground if I had those!
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible=shocked,You'd need the golden gauntlets to lift those things!
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:mia=shocked,Woah! I guess today, we play <i>your</i> way!
-1-female_large_chest_is_visible,target:palutena=interested,With all her human supporters, I guess ~name~ didn't feel the need for a bra.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=horny,Make sure to cover up afterwards... or don't... that's fine too...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible=angry,<i>HEY!</i> Try not to get distracted! These things can be delicate!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=angry,It's always bad when the person with the weapon makes a mistake...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=loss,Wait! Something's wrong!
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:aimee=cry,Why didn't you use your z-targeting, Aimee?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:twilight=puzzled,What goddess determined that order?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:arwen=shy,Kind of makes you wish you could just... turn invisible. Right, ~name~?
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:arwen=angry,I'm sorry, ~name~, there's no cheat code or magic item to get you out of this one.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:arwen=shy,It could be worse, ~name~. There could be some looming presence that watches our every move and rea- <i>*cough* listens</i> to every word we say.
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru=puzzled,Wait a minute...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:nayru=puzzled,Hold on a second...
-1-female_crotch_will_be_visible,target:remilia=shocked,Where did all those-!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible=shocked,Welcome to the party!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible=shy,I've spent far too long stuck like this, so glad you can finally join me.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=loss,Oh no! It looks like you've been infected with Ganondorf's evil!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=cry,It smells worse than the inside of Jabu Jabu!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=loss,Not even the Great King of Evil himself, frightens me as much as whatever ~name~ has just shown us.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:moon=loss,I can't believe the number of horrifying moons that Link has seen is so long that we've had to start a list.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru=angry,You aren't the <i>real</i> Nayru!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:nayru=angry,You aren't an actual goddess!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mahiru=shocked,I can't believe you decided to keep your camera for so long!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:mahiru=excited,It takes a lot of courage to be where you are, ~name~ and to still keep an important item by your side.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jolyne=shocked,It seems Jolyne doesn't have all of her *necessary items*.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:jolyne=embarrassed,I'd give you a hint, Joylne, but I think you already know what went wrong...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=shocked,You aren't going to shave your head next time you lose? It's so lush and <i>blue</i>!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:felicia=shy,I'm sure <i>someone</i> could think of a joke for this moment, but I can't think of anything.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:remilia=embarrassed,I... don't think that's how that's supposed to happen...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:elaine=embarrassed,What's that weird mark on your... your... um... <i>rear</i>?
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=shocked,That's an interesting choice, ~name~. Way to shake things up!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:wiifitfemale=happy,<i>WATCH OUT!</i> ~name~'s going off the books!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:cammy=shocked,Oh no! Looks like your leotard got ripped in that fight!
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=embarrassed,Oh... it seems to have... hmmm...
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:aimee=shy,That... <i>didn't seem planned...</i>
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=appreciative,I see you're going for a natural look. I appreciate it.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=interested,Nothing wrong with some <i>long grass</i> here and there.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=shy,I'm sure you have someone special back home to get lost in those woods.
-1-female_crotch_is_visible,filter:hairy=appreciative,I see you've been <i>growing it out</i> a little more than me, ~name~.




#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written
male_finished_masturbating=shocked,<i>WOAH</i>! I didn't know it did <i>that</i>.
male_finished_masturbating=shocked,Is that how it works?


#stage-specific lines that override the stage-generic ones

#fully clothed
0-male_must_masturbate=happy,Remember to... um... spit on your hands first! For lubrication!
0-male_must_masturbate=cry,<i>(I probably should have learned about how men masturbate before I came here.)</i>
0-male_start_masturbating=happy,Don't worry, ~name~, I'm an expert who'll provide you with all the helpful tips you need.
0-male_start_masturbating=happy,There's nothing to fear with the hint-giving specialist, Navi, being here!
0-male_masturbating=puzzled,<i>Is that how that works?</i>
0-male_masturbating=puzzled,I wonder what the action icon will say if I get close to ~name~?
0-male_finished_masturbating=shocked,It comes out of the end of that!
0-female_must_masturbate=horny,It's hard to imagine how this works without... hands.
0-female_must_masturbate=shocked,Woah! I'm doing much better than I thought I would.
0-female_must_masturbate=shocked,<i>HEY!</i> I can't believe that I'm doing this good.
0-female_start_masturbating=puzzled,Is... <i>that</i> how you do it?
0-female_start_masturbating=puzzled,Should I start writing this down?
0-female_masturbating=shocked,That is... not what I expected.
0-female_masturbating=cry,I-I had no idea about...
0-female_finished_masturbating=shocked,Woah! That's more than I expected!


#lost light
1-male_must_masturbate=shy,D-don't worry, ~name~, I'm a t-total expert on this!
1-male_must_masturbate=shy,Alright... just g-grip it with your ha... (hand?) Hand!
1-male_must_masturbate,target:link=cry,D-don't worry, Nintendo. That is actually just a cosplayer and <i>definitely</i> not one of your most beloved IPs about to masturbate.
1-male_must_masturbate,target:link,marker:button=cry,~player~! If there's a button you can press or something to stop the game, please do so!
1-male_start_masturbating=calm,(If there was ever a time to get a poker face, it's now or never!)
1-male_start_masturbating=appreciative,You should try taking a short jog before you start to increase blood flow.
1-male_start_masturbating,target:link=angry,I don't care how <i>free</i> or <i>liberated</i> you feel right now! Do you want to see Ocarina of Time remastered for the switch or not!?
1-male_start_masturbating,target:link,saidMarker:button=angry,Thanks for nothing, ~player~. Maybe you aren't the chosen one.
1-male_masturbating=appreciative,~name~, have you tried... um... swapping hands?
1-male_masturbating=excited,How about flipping over, ~name~, so that it all comes out faster from gravity!
1-male_masturbating=shy,Don't to forget to also spend time stroking the... um... the... <i>testicles</i>... too.
1-male_masturbating,target:link=interested,You know, it's funny Nintendo...  <i>(No, no, not like that.)</i> I'm so sorry, Nintendo! <i>(Much better.)</i>
1-male_masturbating,target:link=happy,I hope I can still get the severance package. You get a free amiibo of your choice!
1-male_masturbating,target:link=shy,I wonder if Midna will let me stay at her place after I get fired?
1-male_masturbating,target:link=angry,I hope Proxi doesn't get my job. Taught her everything she knows and then suddenly she was too good for me.
1-male_masturbating,target:link=shy,The game's two decades old. I guess this was bound to happen at some point.
1-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=shocked,Huh? I expected... I don't know... some kind of explosive finish or something.
1-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=puzzled,So, wait. Do men not... do the thing? Is it only some of them? Why must understanding things have such a high difficulty setting?
1-female_must_masturbate=happy,I know plenty about this stuff. I once saw a cucco hatch!
1-female_must_masturbate=shy,I th-think you might know a <i>little</i> more about this than I do...
1-female_must_masturbate,target:joey,totalFemales:5-5=appreciative,I think we might have slipped ~name~ up a bit, huh ladies?
1-female_must_masturbate,target:joey,totalFemales:5-5=appreciative,Not used to a crowd of all women, are you, ~name~?
1-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha,saidMarker:blue=shocked,Wait! You've turned pale! What happened to my blue-skinned friend!
1-female_must_masturbate,target:alice_mgq=puzzled,Even with the transformation, I still don't think she's the weirdest person to attend this place. She's probably not even top five.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu,alsoPlaying:human,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=angry,Well it's a little too late for this. ~player~'s already lost. Nice job, ~name~.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:arwen=embarrassed,This is what the people would want to see from an elf of this caliper.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:arwen=excited,<i>HEY! HEY! HEY!</i> I'm distracting them, Queen ~name~, so you can get started!
1-female_must_masturbate,target:palutena,alsoPlaying:nayru,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=shocked,Not you too, Palutena!
1-female_must_masturbate,target:palutena,alsoPlaying:nayru,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=puzzled,I think I'm seriously overestimating the powers of a goddess.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:sayaka=interested,What are you gonna do with that gem, Sayaka?
1-female_must_masturbate,target:sayaka=puzzled,I've never seen a gem like *that* before. Is it used for money?
1-female_must_masturbate,target:nayru=shy,Oh... the <i>definitely not a goddess</i> has to go. <i>sigh...</i>
1-female_must_masturbate,target:nayru=angry,Well, that's that. No goddess would subject herself to this.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu=angry,I say it's about time.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:mia=embarrassed,I think that's enough jabbering from us... feel free to get on with it, Mia.
1-female_must_masturbate,target:akko=loss,Be careful! If she's going to pull any magic, now's gonna be the time!
1-female_must_masturbate,target:akko=angry,Who knows what kind of crazy magic a witch might have for this kind of thing!
1-female_must_masturbate,target:nayru,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=angry,I'm sorry, ~name~. I can't trust you anymore, so I think I'll just be with a <i>real</i> goddess, like Palutena.
1-female_start_masturbating=happy,Remember, slow and steady wins the race. Except for horse races.
1-female_start_masturbating=appreciative,I wish you nothing but the <i>BEST</i> of luck.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu,alsoPlaying:human,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=angry,Please demonstrate what ~player~ will be doing tonight, since he won't be getting any epilogues.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=interested,You're on your own, here, ~name~.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=excited,I've done my part, ~name~. Now, it's all up to you!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:nayru=horny,Just... get on with it... ~name~.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:nayru=angry,If you were an <i>actual</i> goddess, this probably wouldn't have happened.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:akko=embarrassed,Please tell me you aren't going to bring out a twin sister here. That's wrong in too many ways.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:palutena,alsoPlaying:nayru,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=puzzled,Are you not really a goddess, Palutena?
1-female_start_masturbating,target:palutena,alsoPlaying:nayru,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=cry,It's Nayru all over again. Please tell me you're a real Goddess, Palutena.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:sayaka=shocked,So are you about to put that gem...
1-female_start_masturbating,target:sayaka=shocked,I can't believe you just ate that whole thing, Sayaka!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:sei=horny,I'm actually a little surprised that you'll be <i>able</i> to stand for this part.
1-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,Wait... I don't think that's supposed to happen!
1-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,Alright, little Miss Promiscuous, show us how it's done.
1-female_start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:mia=interested,Bully for you, Mia!
1-female_masturbating=embarrassed,I'm sorry if my wings are causing a breeze over your... um...
1-female_masturbating=calm,Note to magic users: Don't try contacting people telepathically just after nightfall.
1-female_masturbating=appreciative,That's good, ~name~! Try switching it up if you get tired.
1-female_masturbating,target:cammy=horny,They look like they're doing an <i>amazing job</i>...
1-female_masturbating,target:cammy=angry,They'll just let anyone in here, won't they?
1-female_masturbating,target:cammy=embarrassed,There's no need for hints here, since this looks like a <i>group project.</i>
1-female_masturbating,target:cammy=horny,They already seem to know everything <i>intimate</i> about Cammy.
1-female_masturbating,target:cammy=shy,It's Saturday night with the Gerudo all over again...
1-female_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,C'mon, ~name~, I thought you were supposed to be some kind of expert here?
1-female_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,No no no! You're doing it all wrong, ~name~! It's like you know nothing about weakpoints!
1-female_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,Really, ~player~? You would have had <i>her</i> as your sidekick if I wasn't here?
1-female_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,Oh, <i>now</i> she decides to fly. I've been flying around this whole game!
1-female_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,So, you aren't even going to <i>try</i> using both hands at once, Kyu? How lazy.
1-female_masturbating,target:catria=puzzled,Catria, are you still <i>there</i>?
1-female_masturbating,target:catria=angry,<i>HEY!</i> Catria! I think you should... <i>I don't think she's paying attention to me at all...</i>
1-female_masturbating,target:catria=puzzled,<i>HEY!</i> Catria! <i>LISTEN!</i> Getting through to her may take longer than I thought...
1-female_masturbating,target:catria=horny,Well, whoever this mysterious dream man is, he seems to be doing quite good job...
1-female_masturbating,target:catria=puzzled,Is there any chance that Catria's going to break out of that trance?
1-female_masturbating,target:aimee=horny,I <i>really</i> don't think you should be using that <i>thing</i> for this purpose.
1-female_masturbating,target:aimee=angry,For everyone else, I don't recommend stick weapons up... <i>there</i>. No, not even the hilts!
1-female_masturbating,target:aimee=excited,Despite everything... you see to be doing quite well, Aimee.
1-female_masturbating,target:aimee=cry,This kind of reminds me of when Zelda found Link's Master Sword late at night and... <i>shudder</i>
1-female_masturbating,target:aimee=shy,<i>(Don't even think about trying anything funny when you get home, Navi.)</i>
1-female_masturbating,target:joey=horny,Whatever that thing is, it certainly seems to be working.
1-female_masturbating,target:joey=puzzled,Why aren't you using your hands, ~name~?
1-female_masturbating,target:joey=shy,Do you always need that magic wand?
1-female_masturbating,target:joey=calm,It looks like your hat can hold as much as Link's bag.
1-female_masturbating,target:joey=shy,I don't think I can give you any tips while you're using that wand.
1-female_masturbating,target:launch=horny,I really don't think you should be using your weapon... <i>like that</i>...
1-female_masturbating,target:launch=interested,That's an <i>interesting</i> way to do that, Launch.
1-female_masturbating,target:launch=angry,<i>HEY!</i> Launch! You can't do that! You might hurt yourself?
1-female_masturbating,target:launch=shocked,The scariest part about what Launch is doing, is that it seems to be working for her.
1-female_masturbating,target:launch=cry,I wish the blue-haired Launch was here. She probably wouldn't use her weapon like <i>that</i>...
1-female_masturbating,target:launch=embarrassed,Just... watch your fingers, Launch.
1-female_masturbating,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=embarrassed,Just don't make <i>eye contact</i>, ~name~.
1-female_masturbating,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=puzzled,I'm suddenly in the mood for something sweet. Like a candy cane or something.
1-female_masturbating,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=interested,I think you need more <i>speed</i>, ~name~. Someone here must know something about going fast...
1-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shy,I sort of feel like I'm intruding on something here...
1-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,I didn't know we were allowed to bring guests!
1-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=embarrassed,I would give you tips, ~name~, but I think that no one knows what you like better than... you.
1-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,Ooooh! Does your other self copy every action you do?
1-female_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=puzzled,<i>(I don't understand how the one wand was different from the other.)</i>
1-female_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=excited,That golden-whatever seems to be working!
1-female_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=happy,I can give out any helpful hints and tips while you use that thing, ~name~!
1-female_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=horny,Unfortunately, we don't have anything like what ~name~ is using back in Hyrule. <i>Very unfortunate.</i>
1-female_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=happy,I can see why your audience is so loyal, ~name~.
1-female_masturbating,target:felicia=puzzled,Is the wand some sort of cat-thing?
1-female_masturbating,target:felicia=interested,First you strip weird, now the wand. You're pretty strange, ~name~.
1-female_masturbating,target:felicia=puzzled,Are you the one making that weird humming noise, ~name~?
1-female_masturbating,target:felicia=horny,I don't know what that <i>thing</i> is, but it seems to be working.
1-female_masturbating,target:felicia=horny,C-could I try that thing you're using, F-~name~?
1-female_masturbating,target:amalia=excited,That's such a great strategy, ~name~! I should use that!
1-female_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=puzzled,I'm sorry, ~name~, but I think this is beyond any hints I could give you.
1-female_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=horny,Maybe you can try both hands at once, ~name~!
1-female_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=interested,<i>(I wonder what the scales feel like in there.)</i>
1-female_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=embarrassed,<i>(Well, at least her skin color got a lot prettier after she transformed.)</i>
1-female_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=excited,I don't know how versatile your tail is, ~name~, but seems like a great time to find out!
1-female_finished_masturbating=shocked,So much power!
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=happy,Great! The good Launch has returned!
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:sei=shocked,That one must have been intense! It knocked her right onto the floor!
1-female_finished_masturbating,target:sei=shocked,I'm speechless... or to put it a bit better, there's nothing left to Sei.

#lost dress
2-male_must_masturbate=appreciative,Try sitting on your hand before you start, so that it feels like someone else is helping you.
2-male_must_masturbate=puzzled,They say that men use visual stimuli during sex, but I don't know where you'd get that around here.
2-male_must_masturbate,target:link=cry,D-don't worry, Nintendo. That is actually just a cosplayer and <i>definitely</i> not one of your most beloved IPs about to masturbate.
2-male_must_masturbate,target:link,marker:button=cry,~player~! If there's a button you can press or something to stop the game, please do so!
2-male_start_masturbating=horny,You... should try to rub your pectorals to increase your stimulation.
2-male_start_masturbating=embarrassed,<i>Umm...</i> try leaning forward and using your mouth for stimulus.
2-male_start_masturbating,target:link,saidMarker:button=angry,Thanks for nothing, ~player~. Maybe you aren't the chosen one.
2-male_start_masturbating,target:link=angry,I don't care how <i>free</i> or <i>liberated</i> you feel right now! Do you want to see Ocarina of Time remastered for the switch or not!?
2-male_masturbating=excited,You should totally go take a quick jog, ~name~, to increase blood flow.
2-male_masturbating=shy,Let's see... tips... tips... tip... Oh! Remember to get the tip of your... <i>penis</i> too...
2-male_masturbating=interested,Don't forget to save your progress towards <i>e-ejaculation</i>.
2-male_masturbating,target:link=interested,You know, it's funny Nintendo...  <i>(No, no, not like that.)</i> I'm so sorry, Nintendo! <i>(Much better.)</i>
2-male_masturbating,target:link=happy,I hope I can still get the severance package. You get a free amiibo of your choice!
2-male_masturbating,target:link=shy,I wonder if Midna will let me stay at her place after I get fired?
2-male_masturbating,target:link=angry,I hope Proxi doesn't get my job. Taught her everything she knows and then suddenly she was too good for me.
2-male_masturbating,target:link=shy,The game's two decades old. I guess this was bound to happen at some point.
2-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=shocked,Huh? I expected... I don't know... some kind of explosive finish or something.
2-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=puzzled,So, wait. Do men not... do the thing? Is it only some of them? Why must understanding things have such a high difficulty setting?
2-female_must_masturbate=interested,Remember to start out slowly, gently teasing before you go for any insertion.
2-female_must_masturbate=interested,Make sure to get into a comfortable position before you begin.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:akko=loss,Be careful! If she's going to pull any magic, now's gonna be the time!
2-female_must_masturbate,target:akko=angry,Who knows what kind of crazy magic a witch might have for this kind of thing!
2-female_must_masturbate,target:alice_mgq=puzzled,Even with the transformation, I still don't think she's the weirdest person to attend this place. She's probably not even top five.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu,alsoPlaying:human,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=angry,Well it's a little too late for this. ~player~'s already lost. Nice job, ~name~.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:nayru,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=angry,I'm sorry, ~name~. I can't trust you anymore, so I think I'll just be with a <i>real</i> goddess, like Palutena.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha,saidMarker:blue=shocked,Wait! You've turned pale! What happened to my blue-skinned friend!
2-female_must_masturbate,target:mia=embarrassed,I think that's enough jabbering from us... feel free to get on with it, Mia.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu=angry,I say it's about time.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:nayru=shy,Oh... the <i>definitely not a goddess</i> has to go. <i>sigh...</i>
2-female_must_masturbate,target:nayru=angry,Well, that's that. No goddess would subject herself to this.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:joey,totalFemales:5-5=appreciative,I think we might have slipped ~name~ up a bit, huh ladies?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:joey,totalFemales:5-5=appreciative,Not used to a crowd of all women, are you, ~name~?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:sayaka=interested,What are you gonna do with that gem, Sayaka?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:sayaka=puzzled,I've never seen a gem like *that* before. Is it used for money?
2-female_must_masturbate,target:arwen=embarrassed,This is what the people would want to see from an elf of this caliper.
2-female_must_masturbate,target:arwen=excited,<i>HEY! HEY! HEY!</i> I'm distracting them, Queen ~name~, so you can get started!
2-female_must_masturbate,target:palutena,alsoPlaying:nayru,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=shocked,Not you too, Palutena!
2-female_must_masturbate,target:palutena,alsoPlaying:nayru,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=puzzled,I think I'm seriously overestimating the powers of a goddess.
2-female_start_masturbating=interested,Deep breaths, ~name~!
2-female_start_masturbating=appreciative,Take your time, it's not like the moon's about to crash down.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,Alright, little Miss Promiscuous, show us how it's done.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=interested,You're on your own, here, ~name~.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=excited,I've done my part, ~name~. Now, it's all up to you!
2-female_start_masturbating,target:sei=horny,I'm actually a little surprised that you'll be <i>able</i> to stand for this part.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:sayaka=shocked,So are you about to put that gem...
2-female_start_masturbating,target:sayaka=shocked,I can't believe you just ate that whole thing, Sayaka!
2-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,Wait... I don't think that's supposed to happen!
2-female_start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:mia=interested,Bully for you, Mia!
2-female_start_masturbating,target:nayru=horny,Just... get on with it... ~name~.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:nayru=angry,If you were an <i>actual</i> goddess, this probably wouldn't have happened.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu,alsoPlaying:human,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=angry,Please demonstrate what ~player~ will be doing tonight, since he won't be getting any epilogues.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:akko=embarrassed,Please tell me you aren't going to bring out a twin sister here. That's wrong in too many ways.
2-female_start_masturbating,target:palutena,alsoPlaying:nayru,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=puzzled,Are you not really a goddess, Palutena?
2-female_start_masturbating,target:palutena,alsoPlaying:nayru,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=cry,It's Nayru all over again. Please tell me you're a real Goddess, Palutena.
2-female_masturbating=embarrassed,You clearly have more experience than me, ~name~.
2-female_masturbating=shocked,That's a good strategy, ~name~. I might have to use that.
2-female_masturbating=embarrassed,This must be your second playthrough...
2-female_masturbating,target:catria=puzzled,Catria, are you still <i>there</i>?
2-female_masturbating,target:catria=angry,<i>HEY!</i> Catria! I think you should... <i>I don't think she's paying attention to me at all...</i>
2-female_masturbating,target:catria=puzzled,<i>HEY!</i> Catria! <i>LISTEN!</i> Getting through to her may take longer than I thought...
2-female_masturbating,target:catria=horny,Well, whoever this mysterious dream man is, he seems to be doing quite good job...
2-female_masturbating,target:catria=puzzled,Is there any chance that Catria's going to break out of that trance?
2-female_masturbating,target:amalia=excited,That's such a great strategy, ~name~! I should use that!
2-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shy,I sort of feel like I'm intruding on something here...
2-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,I didn't know we were allowed to bring guests!
2-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=embarrassed,I would give you tips, ~name~, but I think that no one knows what you like better than... you.
2-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,Ooooh! Does your other self copy every action you do?
2-female_masturbating,target:felicia=puzzled,Is the wand some sort of cat-thing?
2-female_masturbating,target:felicia=interested,First you strip weird, now the wand. You're pretty strange, ~name~.
2-female_masturbating,target:felicia=puzzled,Are you the one making that weird humming noise, ~name~?
2-female_masturbating,target:felicia=horny,I don't know what that <i>thing</i> is, but it seems to be working.
2-female_masturbating,target:felicia=horny,C-could I try that thing you're using, F-~name~?
2-female_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=puzzled,I'm sorry, ~name~, but I think this is beyond any hints I could give you.
2-female_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=horny,Maybe you can try both hands at once, ~name~!
2-female_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=interested,<i>(I wonder what the scales feel like in there.)</i>
2-female_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=embarrassed,<i>(Well, at least her skin color got a lot prettier after she transformed.)</i>
2-female_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=excited,I don't know how versatile your tail is, ~name~, but seems like a great time to find out!
2-female_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,C'mon, ~name~, I thought you were supposed to be some kind of expert here?
2-female_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,No no no! You're doing it all wrong, ~name~! It's like you know nothing about weakpoints!
2-female_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,Really, ~player~? You would have had <i>her</i> as your sidekick if I wasn't here?
2-female_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,Oh, <i>now</i> she decides to fly. I've been flying around this whole game!
2-female_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,So, you aren't even going to <i>try</i> using both hands at once, Kyu? How lazy.
2-female_masturbating,target:launch=horny,I really don't think you should be using your weapon... <i>like that</i>...
2-female_masturbating,target:launch=interested,That's an <i>interesting</i> way to do that, Launch.
2-female_masturbating,target:launch=angry,<i>HEY!</i> Launch! You can't do that! You might hurt yourself?
2-female_masturbating,target:launch=shocked,The scariest part about what Launch is doing, is that it seems to be working for her.
2-female_masturbating,target:launch=cry,I wish the blue-haired Launch was here. She probably wouldn't use her weapon like <i>that</i>...
2-female_masturbating,target:launch=embarrassed,Just... watch your fingers, Launch.
2-female_masturbating,target:cammy=horny,They look like they're doing an <i>amazing job</i>...
2-female_masturbating,target:cammy=angry,They'll just let anyone in here, won't they?
2-female_masturbating,target:cammy=embarrassed,There's no need for hints here, since this looks like a <i>group project.</i>
2-female_masturbating,target:cammy=horny,They already seem to know everything <i>intimate</i> about Cammy.
2-female_masturbating,target:cammy=shy,It's Saturday night with the Gerudo all over again...
2-female_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=puzzled,<i>(I don't understand how the one wand was different from the other.)</i>
2-female_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=excited,That golden-whatever seems to be working!
2-female_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=happy,I can give out any helpful hints and tips while you use that thing, ~name~!
2-female_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=horny,Unfortunately, we don't have anything like what ~name~ is using back in Hyrule. <i>Very unfortunate.</i>
2-female_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=happy,I can see why your audience is so loyal, ~name~.
2-female_masturbating,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=embarrassed,Just don't make <i>eye contact</i>, ~name~.
2-female_masturbating,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=puzzled,I'm suddenly in the mood for something sweet. Like a candy cane or something.
2-female_masturbating,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=interested,I think you need more <i>speed</i>, ~name~. Someone here must know something about going fast...
2-female_masturbating,target:joey=horny,Whatever that thing is, it certainly seems to be working.
2-female_masturbating,target:joey=puzzled,Why aren't you using your hands, ~name~?
2-female_masturbating,target:joey=shy,Do you always need that magic wand?
2-female_masturbating,target:joey=calm,It looks like your hat can hold as much as Link's bag.
2-female_masturbating,target:joey=shy,I don't think I can give you any tips while you're using that wand.
2-female_masturbating,target:aimee=horny,I <i>really</i> don't think you should be using that <i>thing</i> for this purpose.
2-female_masturbating,target:aimee=angry,For everyone else, I don't recommend stick weapons up... <i>there</i>. No, not even the hilts!
2-female_masturbating,target:aimee=excited,Despite everything... you see to be doing quite well, Aimee.
2-female_masturbating,target:aimee=cry,This kind of reminds me of when Zelda found Link's Master Sword late at night and... <i>shudder</i>
2-female_masturbating,target:aimee=shy,<i>(Don't even think about trying anything funny when you get home, Navi.)</i>
2-female_finished_masturbating=calm,<i>THAT'S</i>  the power of your inner strength!
2-female_finished_masturbating=shocked,Am <i>I</i> gonna have to do that!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:sei=shocked,That one must have been intense! It knocked her right onto the floor!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:sei=shocked,I'm speechless... or to put it a bit better, there's nothing left to Sei.
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:mia=calm,Now you can let it go and move on!
2-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=happy,Great! The good Launch has returned!

-3-male_start_masturbating,target:link=angry,I don't care how <i>free</i> or <i>liberated</i> you feel right now! Do you want to see Ocarina of Time remastered for the switch or not!?

-3-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=puzzled,So, wait. Do men not... do the thing? Is it only some of them? Why must understanding things have such a high difficulty setting?

-3-female_masturbating,target:felicia=horny,C-could I try that thing you're using, F-~name~?
-3-female_masturbating,target:joey=horny,Whatever that thing is, it certainly seems to be working.
-3-female_masturbating,target:joey=puzzled,Why aren't you using your hands, ~name~?
-3-female_masturbating,target:joey=shy,Do you always need that magic wand?
-3-female_masturbating,target:joey=calm,It looks like your hat can hold as much as Link's bag.
-3-female_masturbating,target:joey=shy,I don't think I can give you any tips while you're using that wand.
-3-female_masturbating,target:catria=puzzled,Catria, are you still <i>there</i>?
-3-female_masturbating,target:catria=angry,<i>HEY!</i> Catria! I think you should... <i>I don't think she's paying attention to me at all...</i>
-3-female_masturbating,target:catria=puzzled,<i>HEY!</i> Catria! <i>LISTEN!</i> Getting through to her may take longer than I thought...
-3-female_masturbating,target:catria=horny,Well, whoever this mysterious dream man is, he seems to be doing quite good job...
-3-female_masturbating,target:catria=puzzled,Is there any chance that Catria's going to break out of that trance?
-3-female_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=puzzled,<i>(I don't understand how the one wand was different from the other.)</i>
-3-female_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=excited,That golden-whatever seems to be working!
-3-female_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=happy,I can give out any helpful hints and tips while you use that thing, ~name~!
-3-female_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=horny,Unfortunately, we don't have anything like what ~name~ is using back in Hyrule. <i>Very unfortunate.</i>
-3-female_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=happy,I can see why your audience is so loyal, ~name~.
-3-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shy,I sort of feel like I'm intruding on something here...
-3-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,I didn't know we were allowed to bring guests!
-3-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=embarrassed,I would give you tips, ~name~, but I think that no one knows what you like better than... you.
-3-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,Ooooh! Does your other self copy every action you do?
-3-female_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=puzzled,I'm sorry, ~name~, but I think this is beyond any hints I could give you.
-3-female_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=horny,Maybe you can try both hands at once, ~name~!
-3-female_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=interested,<i>(I wonder what the scales feel like in there.)</i>
-3-female_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=embarrassed,<i>(Well, at least her skin color got a lot prettier after she transformed.)</i>
-3-female_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=excited,I don't know how versatile your tail is, ~name~, but seems like a great time to find out!
-3-female_finished_masturbating=shocked,It's just like the Song of Storms!
-3-female_finished_masturbating=embarrassed,I think that might have caused area damage.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,And with all the grace and professionalism I expected from you, ~name~.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:sei=shocked,That one must have been intense! It knocked her right onto the floor!
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:sei=shocked,I'm speechless... or to put it a bit better, there's nothing left to Sei.
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:mia=calm,Now you can let it go and move on!
-3-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=happy,Great! The good Launch has returned!

-2-male_must_masturbate=excited,It's okay, ~name~, because you have <i>an absolute expert</i> here to guide you along!
-2-male_must_masturbate,target:link=cry,D-don't worry, Nintendo. That is actually just a cosplayer and <i>definitely</i> not one of your most beloved IPs about to masturbate.
-2-male_must_masturbate,target:link,marker:button=cry,~player~! If there's a button you can press or something to stop the game, please do so!
-2-male_start_masturbating=horny,Remember to lick your palms first!
-2-male_start_masturbating=happy,Try alternating between standing and sitting to increase blood flow!
-2-male_start_masturbating,target:link,saidMarker:button=angry,Thanks for nothing, ~player~. Maybe you aren't the chosen one.
-2-male_start_masturbating,target:link=angry,I don't care how <i>free</i> or <i>liberated</i> you feel right now! Do you want to see Ocarina of Time remastered for the switch or not!?
-2-male_masturbating=loss,I'm not sure if what I'm doing is helping you along, ~name~.
-2-male_masturbating=appreciative,I hope the vines are appealing to <i>someone</i> here.
-2-male_masturbating=shy,I'd try to send a vine over to you, ~name~, but I won't know what to do with it.
-2-male_masturbating=excited,Try twisting it with both hands and give your <i>thing</i> that little extra squeeze.
-2-male_masturbating,target:link=interested,You know, it's funny Nintendo...  <i>(No, no, not like that.)</i> I'm so sorry, Nintendo! <i>(Much better.)</i>
-2-male_masturbating,target:link=happy,I hope I can still get the severance package. You get a free amiibo of your choice!
-2-male_masturbating,target:link=shy,I wonder if Midna will let me stay at her place after I get fired?
-2-male_masturbating,target:link=angry,I hope Proxi doesn't get my job. Taught her everything she knows and then suddenly she was too good for me.
-2-male_masturbating,target:link=shy,The game's two decades old. I guess this was bound to happen at some point.
-2-male_finished_masturbating=shocked,<i>MPGH!</i>
-2-male_finished_masturbating=shy,Wow...
-2-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=shocked,Huh? I expected... I don't know... some kind of explosive finish or something.
-2-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=puzzled,So, wait. Do men not... do the thing? Is it only some of them? Why must understanding things have such a high difficulty setting?
-2-female_must_masturbate=interested,I'd like to help, really, but my hands are tied at the moment.
-2-female_must_masturbate=excited,Hooray! Now I can be your companion on this adventure!
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:catria=angry,Wait! I could have just gotten a chair!
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:catria=angry,Wait! They have chairs we can use!
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:catria=shocked,So, I didn't have to use the bean? I could have just gotten a chair!
-2-female_must_masturbate,totalMasturbating:0,totalFinished:0=interested,Do they have to leave now?
-2-female_must_masturbate,totalMasturbating:0,totalFinished:0=puzzled,Does this mean they're out of the game?
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:sayaka=interested,What are you gonna do with that gem, Sayaka?
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:sayaka=puzzled,I've never seen a gem like *that* before. Is it used for money?
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:arwen=embarrassed,This is what the people would want to see from an elf of this caliper.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:arwen=excited,<i>HEY! HEY! HEY!</i> I'm distracting them, Queen ~name~, so you can get started!
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:joey,totalFemales:5-5=appreciative,I think we might have slipped ~name~ up a bit, huh ladies?
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:joey,totalFemales:5-5=appreciative,Not used to a crowd of all women, are you, ~name~?
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:alpha,saidMarker:blue=shocked,Wait! You've turned pale! What happened to my blue-skinned friend!
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:palutena,alsoPlaying:nayru,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=shocked,Not you too, Palutena!
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:palutena,alsoPlaying:nayru,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=puzzled,I think I'm seriously overestimating the powers of a goddess.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:mia=embarrassed,I think that's enough jabbering from us... feel free to get on with it, Mia.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:alice_mgq=puzzled,Even with the transformation, I still don't think she's the weirdest person to attend this place. She's probably not even top five.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu=angry,I say it's about time.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:nayru,alsoPlaying:palutena,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=angry,I'm sorry, ~name~. I can't trust you anymore, so I think I'll just be with a <i>real</i> goddess, like Palutena.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:akko=loss,Be careful! If she's going to pull any magic, now's gonna be the time!
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:akko=angry,Who knows what kind of crazy magic a witch might have for this kind of thing!
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:kyu,alsoPlaying:human,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=angry,Well it's a little too late for this. ~player~'s already lost. Nice job, ~name~.
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:nayru=shy,Oh... the <i>definitely not a goddess</i> has to go. <i>sigh...</i>
-2-female_must_masturbate,target:nayru=angry,Well, that's that. No goddess would subject herself to this.
-2-female_start_masturbating=horny,Unfortunately, I left the rest of my beans in my dress pocket.
-2-female_start_masturbating=shy,I'd love to point things out to help you out... but I'm a little tied up at the moment.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,Wait... I don't think that's supposed to happen!
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:sayaka=shocked,So are you about to put that gem...
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:sayaka=shocked,I can't believe you just ate that whole thing, Sayaka!
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:nayru=horny,Just... get on with it... ~name~.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:nayru=angry,If you were an <i>actual</i> goddess, this probably wouldn't have happened.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:palutena,alsoPlaying:nayru,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=puzzled,Are you not really a goddess, Palutena?
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:palutena,alsoPlaying:nayru,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=cry,It's Nayru all over again. Please tell me you're a real Goddess, Palutena.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,Alright, little Miss Promiscuous, show us how it's done.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=interested,You're on your own, here, ~name~.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=excited,I've done my part, ~name~. Now, it's all up to you!
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:akko=embarrassed,Please tell me you aren't going to bring out a twin sister here. That's wrong in too many ways.
-2-female_start_masturbating,alsoPlaying:mia=interested,Bully for you, Mia!
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu,alsoPlaying:human,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=angry,Please demonstrate what ~player~ will be doing tonight, since he won't be getting any epilogues.
-2-female_start_masturbating,target:sei=horny,I'm actually a little surprised that you'll be <i>able</i> to stand for this part.
-2-female_masturbating=horny,Just transfer the fire in your heart into... <i>other places...</i>
-2-female_masturbating=embarrassed,That's it... slow, small circles to start...
-2-female_masturbating=interested,You know there's someone back home who can drive you over this edge, ~name~!
-2-female_masturbating=puzzled,I guess I'll help out ~name~ here since my hands <i>are... free...</i>
-2-female_masturbating=shy,<i>Hmmm...</i> I'm s-sure you're doing great o-over there, ~name~...
-2-female_masturbating=horny,Oh... d-deku... <i>ahhhh...</i>
-2-female_masturbating,target:catria=puzzled,Catria, are you still <i>there</i>?
-2-female_masturbating,target:catria=angry,<i>HEY!</i> Catria! I think you should... <i>I don't think she's paying attention to me at all...</i>
-2-female_masturbating,target:catria=puzzled,<i>HEY!</i> Catria! <i>LISTEN!</i> Getting through to her may take longer than I thought...
-2-female_masturbating,target:catria=horny,Well, whoever this mysterious dream man is, he seems to be doing quite good job...
-2-female_masturbating,target:catria=puzzled,Is there any chance that Catria's going to break out of that trance?
-2-female_masturbating,target:cammy=horny,They look like they're doing an <i>amazing job</i>...
-2-female_masturbating,target:cammy=angry,They'll just let anyone in here, won't they?
-2-female_masturbating,target:cammy=embarrassed,There's no need for hints here, since this looks like a <i>group project.</i>
-2-female_masturbating,target:cammy=horny,They already seem to know everything <i>intimate</i> about Cammy.
-2-female_masturbating,target:cammy=shy,It's Saturday night with the Gerudo all over again...
-2-female_masturbating,target:aimee=horny,I <i>really</i> don't think you should be using that <i>thing</i> for this purpose.
-2-female_masturbating,target:aimee=angry,For everyone else, I don't recommend stick weapons up... <i>there</i>. No, not even the hilts!
-2-female_masturbating,target:aimee=excited,Despite everything... you see to be doing quite well, Aimee.
-2-female_masturbating,target:aimee=cry,This kind of reminds me of when Zelda found Link's Master Sword late at night and... <i>shudder</i>
-2-female_masturbating,target:aimee=shy,<i>(Don't even think about trying anything funny when you get home, Navi.)</i>
-2-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shy,I sort of feel like I'm intruding on something here...
-2-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,I didn't know we were allowed to bring guests!
-2-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=embarrassed,I would give you tips, ~name~, but I think that no one knows what you like better than... you.

-2-female_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=excited,That golden-whatever seems to be working!
-2-female_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=happy,I can give out any helpful hints and tips while you use that thing, ~name~!
-2-female_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=horny,Unfortunately, we don't have anything like what ~name~ is using back in Hyrule. <i>Very unfortunate.</i>
-2-female_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=happy,I can see why your audience is so loyal, ~name~.
-2-female_masturbating,target:felicia=puzzled,Is the wand some sort of cat-thing?
-2-female_masturbating,target:felicia=interested,First you strip weird, now the wand. You're pretty strange, ~name~.
-2-female_masturbating,target:felicia=puzzled,Are you the one making that weird humming noise, ~name~?
-2-female_masturbating,target:felicia=horny,I don't know what that <i>thing</i> is, but it seems to be working.
-2-female_masturbating,target:felicia=horny,C-could I try that thing you're using, F-~name~?

-2-female_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=excited,I don't know how versatile your tail is, ~name~, but seems like a great time to find out!
-2-female_masturbating,target:joey=horny,Whatever that thing is, it certainly seems to be working.
-2-female_masturbating,target:joey=puzzled,Why aren't you using your hands, ~name~?
-2-female_masturbating,target:joey=shy,Do you always need that magic wand?
-2-female_masturbating,target:joey=calm,It looks like your hat can hold as much as Link's bag.
-2-female_masturbating,target:joey=shy,I don't think I can give you any tips while you're using that wand.
-2-female_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,C'mon, ~name~, I thought you were supposed to be some kind of expert here?
-2-female_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,No no no! You're doing it all wrong, ~name~! It's like you know nothing about weakpoints!
-2-female_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,Really, ~player~? You would have had <i>her</i> as your sidekick if I wasn't here?
-2-female_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,Oh, <i>now</i> she decides to fly. I've been flying around this whole game!
-2-female_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,So, you aren't even going to <i>try</i> using both hands at once, Kyu? How lazy.
-2-female_masturbating,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=embarrassed,Just don't make <i>eye contact</i>, ~name~.
-2-female_masturbating,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=puzzled,I'm suddenly in the mood for something sweet. Like a candy cane or something.
-2-female_masturbating,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=interested,I think you need more <i>speed</i>, ~name~. Someone here must know something about going fast...
-2-female_masturbating,target:launch=horny,I really don't think you should be using your weapon... <i>like that</i>...
-2-female_masturbating,target:launch=interested,That's an <i>interesting</i> way to do that, Launch.
-2-female_masturbating,target:launch=angry,<i>HEY!</i> Launch! You can't do that! You might hurt yourself?
-2-female_masturbating,target:launch=shocked,The scariest part about what Launch is doing, is that it seems to be working for her.
-2-female_masturbating,target:launch=cry,I wish the blue-haired Launch was here. She probably wouldn't use her weapon like <i>that</i>...
-2-female_masturbating,target:launch=embarrassed,Just... watch your fingers, Launch.
-2-female_masturbating,target:amalia=horny,I wish I had your level of control over these things, Amalia!
-2-female_masturbating,target:amalia=shocked,That's certainly one way to use those things!
-2-female_masturbating,target:amalia=embarrassed,Amalia, I'll trade you a bean if you teach me a little of your magic.
-2-female_masturbating,target:amalia=excited,Wow! Your vines look a lot more comfortable than mine, Amalia!
-2-female_masturbating,target:amalia=shy,I feel kind of lucky that my vines aren't as <i>playful</i> as yours, Amalia.
-2-female_masturbating,target:amalia=horny,We might have to exchange <i>gardening</i> tips, Amalia!
-2-female_masturbating,target:amalia=horny,Why do I feel that these vines are doing a better job than... <i>anything else could...?</i>
-2-female_finished_masturbating=shocked,The student has surpassed the teacher!
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:sei=shocked,That one must have been intense! It knocked her right onto the floor!
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:sei=shocked,I'm speechless... or to put it a bit better, there's nothing left to Sei.
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:mia=calm,Now you can let it go and move on!
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=happy,Great! The good Launch has returned!
-2-female_finished_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,And with all the grace and professionalism I expected from you, ~name~.

-1-male_must_masturbate=interested,I'll guide you through this, ~name~. I know male masturbation like the back of my wing!
-1-male_must_masturbate=shy,And you were so close too, ~name~!
-1-male_must_masturbate,target:link=cry,D-don't worry, Nintendo. That is actually just a cosplayer and <i>definitely</i> not one of your most beloved IPs about to masturbate.
-1-male_must_masturbate,target:link,marker:button=cry,~player~! If there's a button you can press or something to stop the game, please do so!
-1-male_start_masturbating=embarrassed,You c-could try whispering words of encouragement to your penis... that'll <i>probably</i> work...
-1-male_start_masturbating=happy,Just start digging a small hole into the floor and then you're ready to begin.
-1-male_start_masturbating=excited,Try pulling on your pubic hair for that little extra bit of roughness.
-1-male_start_masturbating,target:link,saidMarker:button=angry,Thanks for nothing, ~player~. Maybe you aren't the chosen one.
-1-male_start_masturbating,target:link=angry,I don't care how <i>free</i> or <i>liberated</i> you feel right now! Do you want to see Ocarina of Time remastered for the switch or not!?
-1-male_masturbating=horny,For maximum effectiveness, move exactly three fingers up and down with every stroke.
-1-male_masturbating=angry,C'mon, ~name~! I know <i>literal fairies</i> who can do better than you!
-1-male_masturbating=embarrassed,I-I can't believe I'm w-watching this...
-1-male_masturbating=shy,I usually recommend that you take a break, but if you really don't need to...
-1-male_masturbating=shy,(Why do I get this same weird feeling whenever Link says he's going to grab his pole to go fishing?)
-1-male_masturbating=embarrassed,You're doing better than <i>I</i> could do...
-1-male_masturbating=interested,Why don't you go on by yourself for a bit? <i>I wouldn't want to get overbearing or anything...</i>
-1-male_masturbating=happy,Yes, ~name~! That is definitely a good strategy. Trust me.
-1-male_masturbating,target:link=interested,You know, it's funny Nintendo...  <i>(No, no, not like that.)</i> I'm so sorry, Nintendo! <i>(Much better.)</i>
-1-male_masturbating,target:link=happy,I hope I can still get the severance package. You get a free amiibo of your choice!

-1-male_finished_masturbating=puzzled,<i>(So that's what it looks like when they finish.)</i>
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=shocked,Huh? I expected... I don't know... some kind of explosive finish or something.
-1-male_finished_masturbating,target:9s=puzzled,So, wait. Do men not... do the thing? Is it only some of them? Why must understanding things have such a high difficulty setting?
-1-female_must_masturbate=interested,The first step to any masturbation is to have fun and be yourself.
-1-female_must_masturbate=happy,If you do it right, masturbation is more fun than smashing a room full of pots!
-1-female_must_masturbate,target:akko=loss,Be careful! If she's going to pull any magic, now's gonna be the time!

-1-female_start_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=interested,You're on your own, here, ~name~.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=excited,I've done my part, ~name~. Now, it's all up to you!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,Alright, little Miss Promiscuous, show us how it's done.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:vriska=shocked,Wait... I don't think that's supposed to happen!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:sei=horny,I'm actually a little surprised that you'll be <i>able</i> to stand for this part.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:sayaka=shocked,So are you about to put that gem...
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:sayaka=shocked,I can't believe you just ate that whole thing, Sayaka!
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:palutena,alsoPlaying:nayru,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=puzzled,Are you not really a goddess, Palutena?
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:palutena,alsoPlaying:nayru,alsoPlayingStage:8-9=cry,It's Nayru all over again. Please tell me you're a real Goddess, Palutena.
-1-female_start_masturbating,target:kyu,alsoPlaying:human,alsoPlayingStage:9-10=angry,Please demonstrate what ~player~ will be doing tonight, since he won't be getting any epilogues.
-1-female_masturbating=horny,What's that technique called? I'll have to remember it.
-1-female_masturbating=happy,That's it, ~name~! Keep up the good work!
-1-female_masturbating=embarrassed,The way you're going, ~name~, you'll be finished in only a few turns!
-1-female_masturbating=embarrassed,I don't know what to do with these butterflies in my stomach. Maybe I can sell them?
-1-female_masturbating=excited,Just keep at that pace!
-1-female_masturbating=angry,Technique, technique, technique! It's all about how you do it!
-1-female_masturbating=shocked,It looks like you don't even <i>need</i> a tutorial, ~name~!
-1-female_masturbating=excited,Get excited, ~name~!
-1-female_masturbating,target:cammy=horny,They look like they're doing an <i>amazing job</i>...
-1-female_masturbating,target:cammy=angry,They'll just let anyone in here, won't they?
-1-female_masturbating,target:cammy=embarrassed,There's no need for hints here, since this looks like a <i>group project.</i>
-1-female_masturbating,target:cammy=horny,They already seem to know everything <i>intimate</i> about Cammy.
-1-female_masturbating,target:cammy=shy,It's Saturday night with the Gerudo all over again...
-1-female_masturbating,target:felicia=puzzled,Is the wand some sort of cat-thing?
-1-female_masturbating,target:felicia=interested,First you strip weird, now the wand. You're pretty strange, ~name~.
-1-female_masturbating,target:felicia=puzzled,Are you the one making that weird humming noise, ~name~?
-1-female_masturbating,target:felicia=horny,I don't know what that <i>thing</i> is, but it seems to be working.
-1-female_masturbating,target:felicia=horny,C-could I try that thing you're using, F-~name~?
-1-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shy,I sort of feel like I'm intruding on something here...
-1-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,I didn't know we were allowed to bring guests!
-1-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=embarrassed,I would give you tips, ~name~, but I think that no one knows what you like better than... you.
-1-female_masturbating,target:elizabeth=shocked,Ooooh! Does your other self copy every action you do?
-1-female_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=puzzled,I'm sorry, ~name~, but I think this is beyond any hints I could give you.
-1-female_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=horny,Maybe you can try both hands at once, ~name~!
-1-female_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=interested,<i>(I wonder what the scales feel like in there.)</i>
-1-female_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=embarrassed,<i>(Well, at least her skin color got a lot prettier after she transformed.)</i>
-1-female_masturbating,target:alice_mgq=excited,I don't know how versatile your tail is, ~name~, but seems like a great time to find out!
-1-female_masturbating,target:joey=horny,Whatever that thing is, it certainly seems to be working.
-1-female_masturbating,target:joey=puzzled,Why aren't you using your hands, ~name~?
-1-female_masturbating,target:joey=shy,Do you always need that magic wand?
-1-female_masturbating,target:joey=calm,It looks like your hat can hold as much as Link's bag.
-1-female_masturbating,target:joey=shy,I don't think I can give you any tips while you're using that wand.
-1-female_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,C'mon, ~name~, I thought you were supposed to be some kind of expert here?
-1-female_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,No no no! You're doing it all wrong, ~name~! It's like you know nothing about weakpoints!
-1-female_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,Really, ~player~? You would have had <i>her</i> as your sidekick if I wasn't here?
-1-female_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,Oh, <i>now</i> she decides to fly. I've been flying around this whole game!
-1-female_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,So, you aren't even going to <i>try</i> using both hands at once, Kyu? How lazy.
-1-female_masturbating,target:launch=horny,I really don't think you should be using your weapon... <i>like that</i>...
-1-female_masturbating,target:launch=interested,That's an <i>interesting</i> way to do that, Launch.
-1-female_masturbating,target:launch=angry,<i>HEY!</i> Launch! You can't do that! You might hurt yourself?
-1-female_masturbating,target:launch=shocked,The scariest part about what Launch is doing, is that it seems to be working for her.
-1-female_masturbating,target:launch=cry,I wish the blue-haired Launch was here. She probably wouldn't use her weapon like <i>that</i>...
-1-female_masturbating,target:launch=embarrassed,Just... watch your fingers, Launch.
-1-female_masturbating,target:aimee=horny,I <i>really</i> don't think you should be using that <i>thing</i> for this purpose.
-1-female_masturbating,target:aimee=angry,For everyone else, I don't recommend stick weapons up... <i>there</i>. No, not even the hilts!
-1-female_masturbating,target:aimee=excited,Despite everything... you see to be doing quite well, Aimee.
-1-female_masturbating,target:aimee=cry,This kind of reminds me of when Zelda found Link's Master Sword late at night and... <i>shudder</i>
-1-female_masturbating,target:aimee=shy,<i>(Don't even think about trying anything funny when you get home, Navi.)</i>
-1-female_masturbating,target:catria=puzzled,Catria, are you still <i>there</i>?
-1-female_masturbating,target:catria=angry,<i>HEY!</i> Catria! I think you should... <i>I don't think she's paying attention to me at all...</i>
-1-female_masturbating,target:catria=puzzled,<i>HEY!</i> Catria! <i>LISTEN!</i> Getting through to her may take longer than I thought...
-1-female_masturbating,target:catria=horny,Well, whoever this mysterious dream man is, he seems to be doing quite good job...
-1-female_masturbating,target:catria=puzzled,Is there any chance that Catria's going to break out of that trance?
-1-female_masturbating,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=embarrassed,Just don't make <i>eye contact</i>, ~name~.
-1-female_masturbating,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=puzzled,I'm suddenly in the mood for something sweet. Like a candy cane or something.
-1-female_masturbating,target:weiss,alsoPlaying:ruby=interested,I think you need more <i>speed</i>, ~name~. Someone here must know something about going fast...
-1-female_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=puzzled,<i>(I don't understand how the one wand was different from the other.)</i>
-1-female_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=excited,That golden-whatever seems to be working!
-1-female_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=happy,I can give out any helpful hints and tips while you use that thing, ~name~!
-1-female_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=horny,Unfortunately, we don't have anything like what ~name~ is using back in Hyrule. <i>Very unfortunate.</i>
-1-female_masturbating,target:streaming-chan=happy,I can see why your audience is so loyal, ~name~.
-1-female_finished_masturbating=shocked,More vulnerable than Gohma's eyes.
-1-female_finished_masturbating=shy,It was a rush, wasn't it?
-1-female_finished_masturbating=shocked,Wow! That was quite a finish, ~name~!
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:mia=calm,Now you can let it go and move on!
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:launch=happy,Great! The good Launch has returned!
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:kyu=angry,And with all the grace and professionalism I expected from you, ~name~.
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:sei=shocked,That one must have been intense! It knocked her right onto the floor!
-1-female_finished_masturbating,target:sei=shocked,I'm speechless... or to put it a bit better, there's nothing left to Sei.




#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.
