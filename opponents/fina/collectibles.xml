        <title>Silver Moon Stone</title>
        <subtitle>Contains the power of void.</subtitle>
        <text>Fina slipped this gleaming, smooth silver stone into your hand before hurrying away after your game with her. Holding it makes you feel connected to life, death and the void between---maybe even in a way that would give you some related magical abilities if you beat up enough weird jellyfish while carrying it. It smells pleasantly of her...</text>

        <text>After you played with her---and saw her at her most vulnerable---so many times, Fina feels that you and she share a special bond. She decided to have another new experience with you, and let you take this picture of her after your game together. Promise you won't show it to anyone else...</text>

        <title>Fina's Earrings</title>
        <text>With your help, Fina has experienced everything the game has to offer---the thrill of winning, the pleasure of defeat, and the intimacy of losing side by side. To thank you for broadening her horizons, she gifted you her earrings. By this point, those were the only things you'd never seen her take off...</text>
        <unlock>Win a game against Fina after previously both losing a game to her, and losing a game that she also lost.</unlock>

        <title>A letter from Fina</title>
        <subtitle>Invitation to a special game on Crescent Isle...</subtitle>
        <text>You received this letter in the mail... it's not obvious how Fina got it to you, but it's clearly her handwriting. It seems to be an invitation to a special game of strip poker in the not-too-distant future. She, Vyse and Aika will be playing on Crescent Isle, using similar rules to the Inventory's. Although, it sounds like she's interested in making her own modifications as well...</text>
        <unlock>Get Fina to shout your name during her climax, then finish the game. (Hint: first obtain her earrings collectible, then lose and masturbate alongside her.)</unlock>
