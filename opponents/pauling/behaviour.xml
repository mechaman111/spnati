Yeah, let's not think about that...)&lt;/i&gt;</state>
                <state img="#-calm.png">Another fine, boring, generic, and otherwise fully uninteresting hand. But I guess when you think about it, almost ALL poker hands are most of those things. It's not like having four big "K"s makes the hand look any cooler. </state>
                <state img="#-appreciative.png">This hand's pretty mediocre. Truth be told, I'm half-hoping that I lose, I'd kinda rather be in my panties than pantyhose.</state>

                <state img="#-disappointed.png">Y'know, sometimes I wish I could just get purely crap hands instead of generic, mediocre ones. "Oh wow, I got a pair!" Yeah, that's not interesting at all. A 7 high is, like, way more memorable.</state>
                <state img="#-calm.png">With 5 draws and one exchange, a pair is actually the MOST likely hand to get assuming you're going for one. That's right, everyone with just a high card- you're below the bell curve.</state>

                <state img="#-calm.png">Chances are, someone has something worse. If they don't, well... I guess I lose? That part's kinda self-explanatory, but I waited too long to stop talking, now I'm just too invested in the sentence... is anyone even paying attention to me right now?</state>
                <state img="#-calm.png">Could be worse. &lt;i&gt;Should&lt;/i&gt; be better. &lt;i&gt;(I'm talking to &lt;br&gt;you, Dealer.)&lt;/i&gt;</state>

                <state img="#-calm.png">A royal flush is literally 1 in 1,000,000. A 7-high, the worst possible hand, is one in several thousand. A pair, incidentally, is pretty&lt;br&gt; much 50/50.</state>
                <state img="#-excited.png">You might think I'm down and out, but I'm not ready to throw in the towel just yet. Or I guess I'm not ready to&lt;i&gt;sit on&lt;/i&gt; the towel, in this case.</state>
                <state img="#-excited.png">This hand looks average, but I see great things in its future. &lt;i&gt;(Gosh, I hope none of them can tell I'm bluffing. This hand's future is... cloudy.)&lt;/i&gt;</state>
