#When selecting the characters to play the game, the first line will always play, then it randomly picks from any of the start lines after you commence the game but before you deal the first hand.


#Items of clothing should be listed here in order of removal.
#The values are formal name, lower case name, how much they cover, what they cover
#Please do not put spaces around the commas.
#"Important" clothes cover genitals (lower) or chest/breasts (upper). For example: bras, panties, a skirt when going commando.
#"Major" clothes cover underwear. For example: skirts, pants, shirts, dresses.
#"Minor" clothes cover skin or are large pieces of clothing that do not cover skin. For example: jackets, socks, stockings, gloves.
#"Extra" clothes are small items that may or may not be clothing but do not cover anything interesting. For example: jewelry, shoes or boots with socks underneath, belts, hats. In the rest of the code, "extra" clothes are called "accessory".
#If for some reason you write another word for the type of clothes (e.g. "accessory"), other characters will not react at all when the clothing is removed.
#What they cover = upper (upper body), lower (lower body), other (neither).
#The game can support any number of entries, but typically we use 2-8, with at least one "important" layer for upper and lower (each).

#Notes on dialogue
#All lines that start with a # symbol are comments and will be ignored by the tool that converts this file into a xml file for the game.
#Where more than one line has an identical type, like "swap_cards" and "swap_cards", the game will randomly select one of these lines each time the character is in that situation.
#You should try to include multiple lines for most stages, especially the final (finished) stage, -1. 

#A character goes through multiple stages as they undress. The stage number starts at zero and indicates how many layers they have removed. Special stage numbers are used when they are nude (-3), masturbating (-2), and finished (-1).
#Line types that start with a number will only display during that stage. The will override any numberless stage-generic lines. For example, in stage 4 "4-swap_cards" will be used over "swap_cards" if it is not blank here. Giving a character unique dialogue for each stage is an effective way of showing their changing openness/shyness as the game progresses.
#You can combine the above points and make multiple lines for a particular situation in a particular stage, like "4-swap_cards" and "4-swap_cards".

#Some special words can be used that will be substituted by the game for context-appropriate ones: ~name~ is the name of the character they're speaking to, but this only works if someone else is in focus. ~clothing~ is the type of clothing that is being removed by another player. ~Clothing~ is almost the same, but it starts with a capital letter in case you want to start a sentence with it.
#~name~ can be used any time a line targets an opponent (game_over_defeat, _must_strip, _removing_, _removed, _must_masturbate, etc).
#~clothing~ can be used only when clothing is being removed (_removing and _removed, but NOT _must_strip).
#~player~ can be used at any time and refers to the human player.
#~cards~ can be used only in the swap_cards lines.
#All wildcards can be used once per line only! If you use ~name~ twice, the code will show up the second time.

#Lines can be written that are only spoken when specific other characters are present. For a detailed explanation, read this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/spnati/comments/6nhaj0/the_easy_way_to_write_targeted_lines/
#Here is an example line (note that targeted lines must have a stage number):
#0-female_must_strip,target:hermioine=happy,Looks like your magic doesn't help with poker!

0-stripping,alsoPlaying:ryuji,alsoPlayingTimeInStage:0-1,count-bodysuit:1-2=stripping,I definitely wish I had my metaverse outfit too, Skull... Look at the others, they have cool bodysuits! Why shouldn't I be allowed to have mine for a game like this!
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:9s=stripping,W-what seems weird? Am I not being cute enough o-o-or? That jacket was comfy!
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:aella=stripping,Rnrhnrm-- no problem, Aella. I know I'm short... Not to be judgy, but are you really be thinking about your sister at a game like this?
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:ann=stripping,I'm here to have fun, Ann. E-e-even if this is um... P-p-pretty embarrassing! And new experiences are the essence of growth!
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:chiaki=stripping,I'm more of a solo player, but I think I'm coming around to playing with others...
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:chiaki=stripping,I'm just starting to learn the benefits of co-op! You get XP a lot faster, right?
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:gwen=stripping,I am a master of computing!
0-stripping,alsoPlaying:gwen=stripping,It sounds weird when you say "whiz." Not to mention stereotypical! I do eat stuff other than cheez-whiz!

#losing boots
1-stripped=stripped,Be nice to my jacket! Sojiro got it for me! Time to put my game face on.
1-stripped=stripped,Okay, time to switch the difficulty up! Let’s slide up my sleeves and let’s do this.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:haru,alsoPlayingStage:0-3=stripped,It was really comfortable, Haru, but I think in a game like this, aren't we supposed to say stuff like "oh, but not nearly as comfy as your boobs!" R-right?
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:ryuji=stripped,It's because I'm hot! And on fire! And all that stuff. I'm gonna start kicking butt now, so you watch out too, Ryuji! I mean Skull!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura=mad,Did you forget to put on a good attitude along with the rest of your clothes?
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:gwen=stripped,I could feed Reed Richards his ass with how loose his computer structuring is.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:gwen=stripped,Oh, I <i>know</i> I'm better at computers than Reed Richards. His electronic countermeasures are <i>weak</i>.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:gwen=disappointed,Gwen, if we could avoid suicide jokes I'd be a lot happier.
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:ann,count-pit:1=shocked,W-w-what’s that supposed to mean, Pit? H-how would you know me better than Ann? Oh no, <i>is God real? Are you an angel?</i> Ann, did we kill God?
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jin=stripped,I don't believe that you can see the future, Jin, but no matter what scam you're running, don't spoil the surprise. I thought really hard about it!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity=stripped,I'm actually into all kinds of stuff! This is just a... a confidence building exercise! For all sort of stuff!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity=stripped,Who's Mineta, Ochako?
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s=stripped,It’s not nice to be insulting, 9S. If that <i>is</i> your real name. Wait a second, are you like some robot?
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:streaming-chan,count-pit:1=stripped,I think they mostly watch her <i>on</i> her back, Pit! Which is where she should be. Because that’s the point of this game, right?
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:chiaki=stripped,You're on, Chiaki!
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=stripped,W-w-what other kind of game would we have?
1-stripped,alsoPlaying:jura,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:fama_and_oma,marker:fama_and_oma=mad,And don't you <i>dare</i> talk about my mother, Jura.

1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:chiaki=triumphant,Well, I'm a big fan of RPGs, for one! I think puzzle games are pretty cool too!
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:chiaki=interested,I'll play just about anything, Chiaki! But I'm probably best in RPGs.
1-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:meia,alsoPlayingStage:0-5=triumphant,We focus on stealing hearts! You know, fixing people's cognitive distortions and breaking into their mental defenses and stuff!
1-must_strip_normal=interested,If this were Hearthstone or MTG I could’ve outplayed that.
1-must_strip_normal=excited,My headphones? No. Glasses? No. Hmm. Boots then.
1-must_strip_normal=disappointed,Hrmgurble. If I had a chair this’d be better.

1-stripping=stripping,You know, I miss my Phantom Thief outfit.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:9s=stripping,Urgh. Robot, android, whatever. And yeah, it’s because I’m smart, obviously.

1-stripping,alsoPlaying:chiaki=stripping,I don't really have a Persona anymore, but there's a few people here in bodysuits, so I kind of wonder if there's a way to get it back...
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:chiaki,count-bodysuit:1=stripping,I technically don't have <i>any</i> Persona anymore since the Metaverse collapsed. I really wish I did though!
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:uravity=stripping,Yeah, I do get to see all k-k-kinds of cool stuff on the internet. I'm not <i>quite</i> sure you'd approve of all of it, Ochako. Mweheheh.
1-stripping,alsoPlaying:sei,marker:tasteless_normies=stripping,Oh, *Kira* Miki? I’m not super big into her music, but I guess I can see why it’s popular… If you’re a tasteless normie.


#losing shirt
2-stripped=stripped,I like thigh highs. They keep my legs from getting cold or stiff.
2-stripped=stripped,Hrm... Maybe I should rethink my strategy.
2-stripped=stripped,If I had Necronomicon, this game’d be over already.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:natsuki=triumphant,I think she is taller! And that means it's easy for ~player~ to manhandle my tiny little body, right? Mwehehe. Don't be so embarrassed, Natsuki!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity=stripped,Er... Not helping the villains, mostly just looking up dirty pictures.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:chiaki=stripped,To be honest, I'm just used to calling it Necronomicon. Prometheus is kind of... Anyway!
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:chiaki=stripped,I'm a completionist, so I <i>definitely</i> unlocked Prometheus. I think Necronomicon looked way cooler, though.
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s=interested,How do <i>you</i> know about Personas, you gothic-lolita knockoff?
2-stripped,alsoPlaying:rinkah,alsoPlayingStage:0-4,marker:desert=stripped,Wind tribe? Um, I haven't played that Fire Emblem, b-b-but I'm a bit more familiar with the desert than I'd like...
2-must_strip_winning=excited,I guess...
2-must_strip_winning=triumphant,Ugh why does this game have catchup mechanics. Just let me snowball and win.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:chiaki=disappointed,I <i>wish</i> I could summon my Persona. I'd kick even <i>more</i> butt.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:chiaki=annoyed,Urgh! I wish! Wouldn't that be so cool?
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:gogo,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=triumphant,Yessss! Please, GoGo, I bet you have great taste!
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:gwen=annoyed,Uh huh. That so, Gwen?
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:gwen=annoyed,I thought my HeroNet profile on you was a lot more about being clever and a lot less about being a jerk.
2-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:saki=awkward,Y-yeah, Saki?
2-must_strip_normal=awkward,Oh fine. You’ve already seen the saucy bits of the tanktop anyway.
2-must_strip_normal=annoyed,Unrhf. Can I just take it off, or do I have to try and look sexy while doing it?
2-must_strip_normal=disappointed,Maybe I should’ve buffed more.
2-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:gogo,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=triumphant,Yessss! Please, GoGo, I bet you have great taste!

2-stripping=stripping,And... voila! Much the same as before, but in black this time!
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:jolyne=stripping,A persona is <i>exactly</i> like a Stand, Jolyne!
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=stripping,I have two shirts--
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:haru,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=stripping,It's just like those sleepovers, Haru, I'm not shy with you here!
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:haru,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=stripping,I'm trying the whole coy thing, Haru. Um... everyone else pretend you didn't hear that.

2-stripping,alsoPlaying:haru,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=stripping,Well, if I don't lose on occasion, Haru, what's the fun?
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:saki=stripping,E-er... Saki, I k-know it's fun to flirt and k-k-kind of the point of this game b-bu-but you should know that I'm--
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:gwen=stripping,Yeah yeah, I'm amazeballs, I know.
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:9s,alsoPlayingStage:2-8=stripping,Genius works in mysterious ways, Oathkeeper!
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:uravity=stripping,Oh really? W-w-well, I do have a s-s-surprise for later!
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:9s=stripping,Genius works in mysterious ways, Nines!
2-stripping,alsoPlaying:ryuji=stripping,Here we go! N-no holding back! And of course I am, Skull. What, did you think this was still high school?


#losing thigh-highs
3-stripped=stripped,Okay. I’m actually starting to get a little worried.
3-stripped=stripped,I’ve gotten through worse. Like. Apocalypse worse. But this is still kinda chilly.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:ryuji,totalMales:3-4=stripped,W-w-well, maybe I'd like to be stared at a little bit, Ryuji. But Phantom Thieves have to watch each other's backs, don't we?
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=stripped,Maybe I'd like to star in something Zone-tan produces. But my outfit is a bit too <i>cyberpunk</i> to just get so dirty right here. At least, um, if you have in mind what I do.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s=stripped,You can call it what you like but I’m kicking your butt in cuteness!
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,count-pit:1=stripped,I’m a grown woman, Pit, and I-I-I will be confident and do as I please! Or as it pleases. Mwhehehe. (Pls halp.)
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:ryuji=stripped,The Phantom Thieves have been through much worse, right, Ryuji? I'm still in this!
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=stripped,How many pairs of <i>being a nice person does Pit have: zero! So there!</i>
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:gwen=stripped,Murderdock? Whoa! That sounds like a really cool band name.
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:gwen=stripped,Maybe I <i>should</i> go work with Murderdock. Just to show you!
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:saki,marker:saki_friendship=awkward,O-oh! That's all? I thought you were hitting on me! W-wait, why wouldn't you hit on me? U-uhm! Sure! Let's play!
3-stripped,alsoPlaying:saki,marker:saki_friendship=happy,--Oh! Okay. Yeah! Let's play together!
3-must_strip_winning=happy,Oh, sorry, I forgot that I still had to strip.
3-must_strip_winning=triumphant,Ha! Hope you’re not expecting me to get all weepy!
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:gogo,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=triumphant,Yessss! Please, GoGo, I bet you have great taste!
3-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:uravity,priority:999=awkward,U-um. Ochako. I can't think of a graceful way to do this so... Would you mind... Lifting me up?
3-must_strip_normal=awkward,I think the term for this is Absolute Territory. Not like... Evangelion though.
3-must_strip_normal=happy,Thigh highs are so comfortable. Once, I got one with little toes on them!
3-must_strip_normal=disappointed,It’s practical, and keeps my legs warm.
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:gogo,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=triumphant,Yessss! Please, GoGo, I bet you have great taste!
3-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:uravity,priority:999=awkward,U-um. Ochako. I can't think of a graceful way to do this so... Would you mind... Lifting me up?

3-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:uravity,priority:999=awkward,U-um. Ochako. I can't think of a graceful way to do this so... Would you mind... Lifting me up?
3-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:gogo,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=triumphant,Yessss! Please, GoGo, I bet you have great taste!
3-stripping=stripping,Is there a graceful way to do this?
3-stripping=stripping,Uhm. I think a guide I read said I’m supposed to bend over and look up while I’m taking these off but I think I’d fall over.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=stripping,Is that so ZT? Hmm... I am <i>quite</i> interested...
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,totalMales:1-3=stripping,You know Zone-tan, w-w-while I don’t think we could have sex, you could maybe use my tights to t-t-tie me up for one of our Y-chromosomed friends! T-they might like that!
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:9s,alsoPlayingStage:2-8=stripping,This 2B you talk about sounds like a hacker with great taste, Oathkeeper.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:haru,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=stripping,It's just like those sleepovers, Haru, I'm not shy with you here!
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:haru,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=stripping,I'm trying the whole coy thing, Haru. Um... everyone else pretend you didn't hear that.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:haru,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=stripping,I do wish I could use some of Necronomicon's powers, Haru.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:haru,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=stripping,Well, if I don't lose on occasion, Haru, what's the fun?
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:uravity,priority:999=launching,Wheee! Ahahahah! I am lording over all of you! <i>You're the best, Ochako!</i>
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:uravity,priority:999=launching,Whoa! This is <i>amazing</i>! Just let me make sure I don't lose my headphones!
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:sei,count-pit:1=stripping,Inkling? <i>Wait, did you think I was from a video game?</i> That’s weird. I’ve… Um. Never thought about being covered in colored goo. That would be <i>gross</i>. Unless you happen to…
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:natsuki=stripping,We're about the same size, Natsuki. These are a clean pair, if you'd like them... That feels like a good secondary objective for this game!
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:pit=stripping,Prepare to be amazed, Pit, as I take these off with grace!
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:sei=stripping,Err, they’re just comfy. And cool looking.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:9s=stripping,This 2B you talk about sounds like a hacker with great taste, 9S.
3-stripping,alsoPlaying:florina,alsoPlayingStage:1-8=stripping,I certainly don't mind, Florina!


#losing tanktop
4-stripped=stripped,W-well, I like to go out into the field on my computer rather than get a lot of direct sunlight, so I’m a little pale.
4-stripped=stripped,Actually, yes, I am cold without those. And n-no, I’m not wearing a bra.
4-stripped=stripped,This is definitely one of those games Ryuji and Inari are always playing, where clothing falls off as HP goes down.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:natsuki=stripped,Er.. most girls share clothing like that, right? It seems like it'd be cute with your uniform.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:sei=stripped,We can’t all have fancy clothes. B-b-but I really do like my stuff!
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,totalMales:1-2=stripped,Sex with you? Suuure. (Psst! ZT I'm flattered but this is just part of the game. Right? Right...?)
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:zone-tan,totalMales:3=stripped,W-w-well, I mean, what girl hasn't thought about being made airtight but--Now? With three men I just met?
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s=happy,Ohh. A “partner?” Mwehehe.
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity,priority:999=launched,I'm a little... Woozy... Whoa, again, again!
4-stripped,alsoPlaying:uravity,priority:999=launched,Woo! O-okay, I'll get the rest of my thigh highs off when I've regained my footing. And adjust my headphones.
4-must_strip_winning=triumphant,I’m sure everyone’s really getting to know each other, and honestly, I’m feeling pretty comfortable now that others have gone first.
4-must_strip_winning=excited,Well. This might be a nice surprise for the rest of you.

4-must_strip_winning,alsoPlaying:gogo,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=triumphant,Yessss! Please, GoGo, I bet you have great taste!
4-must_strip_normal=happy,Normally, I only do this kind of thing on webcam.
4-must_strip_normal=awkward,It’s this or GTFO, right?
4-must_strip_normal=mad,Blargh. I don’t know what everyone’s so excited about.
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:gogo,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=triumphant,Yessss! Please, GoGo, I bet you have great taste!
4-must_strip_normal,alsoPlaying:sei=mad,I-I-if you say I should be a camgirl, Sei--
4-must_strip_losing=shocked,Ugh come on! Normally I’m the one doing the support, but I could really use some!
4-must_strip_losing=annoyed,Fine, hold on.

4-must_strip_losing,alsoPlaying:gogo,alsoPlayingStage:0-6=triumphant,Yessss! Please, GoGo, I bet you have great taste!
4-stripping=stripping,My brain is huge, so this must be the world’s way of compensating.
4-stripping=stripping,Just let me adjust my headphones.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:9s=triumphant,Well, this should answer <i>that</i> question, YorHa Scanner-type Model No.9. Ergh, the first question. I usually do…
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:aella=stripped,Nope! My headphones keep my ears comfy and the music here sucks. This game is also very visually intensive! Er, the good parts, anyway, so I'd like to see, Aella!
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:gwen=stripping,Lizard squad? They're just a bunch of noobs and morons.
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:gwen=stripping,Lizard squad? Oh... No I'm not affiliated with them. That's the whole Lizard thing you hate, right?
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:ryuji=stripping,W-w-well, Skull, Joker <i>always</i> wants me to get out more... I-it's not like we're <i>together</i>... er... depending on playthrough, anyway...
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:uravity=stripping,Here's the last surprise, Ochako!
4-stripping,alsoPlaying:sei=stripping,Oh. Where is Glitch City, again? Uh, hold on, let’s t-t-talk after I’m done, um, w-w-with this.

5-stripped=stripped,What? Bras are uncomfortable.
5-stripped=stripped,Well, this is me. What little there is.
5-stripped=stripped,I’m not going to play a game I can’t see, where I have to listen to people drone on, so the headphones and glasses stay.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:akko,alsoPlayingStage:0-7=stripped,Uhm. No, Akko, not all of us have fancy magic to show ourselves off, so we have to use a few surprises of our own!
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:chiaki=stripped,N-n-nope! I w-w-wanted to be sexy, and figured this was a nice surprise.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:chiaki=stripped,S-s-sure am! R-r-really confident!
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:chiaki=stripped,That's not all, Chiaki! Wait until my next loss!
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:rinkah=triumphant,Mwehehehe. I <i>do</i>, Rinkah!
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:mahiru=stripped,Because I liked those shirts, and it's not like I usually need a bra! Plus, isn't this, er, a lot more surprising and seductive and stuff?
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:9s=stripped,But the point of the game is to seem <i>s-s-sexy</i>. So I figured it’d be an interesting surprise! ...But not the last surprise.
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:merula=stripped,You <i>like</i> my boobs, don't you, Merula? Admit it!
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:pit=stripped,Inkling? I’m not… I’ve never been filled with ink! That’s so d-d-depraved! (And kinda hot…))
5-stripped,alsoPlaying:ryuji,count-ann:1,marker:pt_boobs=triumphant,Actually, no! Skull, who has better boobs! Ann's enormous titties or my cute boobs?! Your team is counting on you!

-3-female_must_strip,target:daria,targetStage:1=awkward,We’re kinda similar, I think. Do you like computers with an emphasis on cognitive psychology?
-3-female_must_strip,target:florina,targetStage:0=interested,Florina, have you ever heard of Haru Okumura? The CEO of Okumura foods?
-3-female_must_strip,target:miko,targetStage:0=disappointed,What? Are you seriously going to just stall the whole time?
-3-female_must_strip,target:wiifitfemale,targetStage:3=excited,In truth... Do you have a better name? I’m just sort of weak. I’d pass out from... Ironically, too much stimulation like that.

-3-female_must_strip,target:miko,targetStage:1=awkward,Um... even ignoring your Persona or ghost or whatever...
-3-female_must_strip,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:pinka_start,targetNotSaidMarker:pinka_end2=disappointed,<i>Sigh.</i> I wish Shadows didn't threaten to kill us so often. Um... if we're in the Metaverse, I should be able to summon Necronomicon, at least...

-3-female_must_strip,target:hanako,targetStage:0-1,targetNotSaidMarker:burns,targetSayingMarker:burns=disappointed,Oh um. Of course.
-3-female_must_strip,target:kyoko,targetStage:4=awkward,Cute underwear, Kyoko. Looks like you planned to lose. But why not take off the gloves? That can’t be sanitary when you… U-um… M-m-masturbate.

-3-female_must_strip,target:d.va,targetStage:2=interested,Say, D.Va, are you listening to K-Pop? I've heard good things, but I'm much more of a... not-pop type person.
-3-male_human_must_strip=excited,I’ve mostly seen this on the internet...

#OPPONENT REMOVING ACCESSORY
#These lines are spoken when an opponent removes a small item that does not cover any skin.
#Typically, characters are fine with this when they are fully dressed but less satisfied as they become more naked.
#Note that all "removing" lines are NOT spoken to human players. Characters will skip straight from "6-male_human_must_strip" to "6-male_removed_accessory", for example.

#fully clothed
0-male_removing_accessory=annoyed,Oh, taking off ~clothing~, ~name~? If I pout will you take off something better next time?

0-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=happy,Aww, but you're so fun to mess with! Well... not as fun Yusuke to mess with. I'm just glad you're here and not him!
0-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:0=interested,Okay, those are pretty cool...
0-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=triumphant,As they say on the internet: "Incest is the best, put your sibling to the test!"
0-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=interested,I think I've seen this plot twist before...

0-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=shocked,Aww… I thought we were going to have a “headgear stays on heads and doesn’t come off even in strip poker” kind of aesthetic going.
0-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:0=triumphant,<i>You have a Persona!</i> Jotaro, what's your Persona's name!? Did I hear you call on the Star Arcana?
0-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=triumphant,It's really cool to watch! It's like woo-boom-wah-ora-ora-ora!

0-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1,count-phantom_thieves:2-3=gremlin,That's <i>so</i> cool. I guess a Stand is another word for a Persona. Did you guys know there were other people still like us!?
0-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=disappointed,Aww... that's it, Skull? Who am I playing with, Noir?

0-female_removing_accessory=interested,Hmm. ~name~ is going to take off her ~clothing~?
0-female_removing_accessory=shocked,Wait, do you categorize ~name~’s ~clothing~ as an accessory, an extra, or a minor piece? The semantics are a bit unclear.
0-female_removing_accessory=happy,O-oh. You’ll take off your ~clothing~?
0-female_removing_accessory=triumphant,~Clothing~, off, now, ~name~. Gogogogo!

0-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=mad,W-w-what? Come on! No fair!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=interested,I guess you could <i>be</i> cursed?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1=happy,I guess I usually just use my headphones to keep my hair in place. I hadn't thought about it like that...
0-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=interested,Really? There's no need to gussy it up. I just prefer to wear the stuff I've always worn...

0-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=shocked,What!? You've got pretty good balance to just lift up like that!
0-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=triumphant,Though maybe if you ripped off that mask, there would be something interesting underneath?
0-female_removing_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:0=interested,Sensible... I guess it's not like we can see your underwear. But I think I see a cameltoe!

0-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=gremlin,See, if I wore a skirt, maybe I'd do that all the time. <i>Maybe</i>. If I weren't awkward.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:ann=triumphant,Ann, Mahiru might've made a good Phantom Thief! She shows off her butt like you do! And has a camera and stuff. Mwehehehe.

0-female_removed_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:1=triumphant,Mwehehe. Don't get too flustered, Haru!
0-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2=awkward,Come <i>onnnn</i> Sola! You're being so modest! When I was in high school... er... well... nevermind.

0-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1=triumphant,Something hard? I hope?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=calm,Maybe not. But you’d definitely look better with longer stockings! Short socks are no fun.
0-female_removed_accessory,target:merula,targetStage:3=gremlin,...or maybe you'd rather someone else tie you up?
0-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=interested,Based on what I’ve heard though, you certainly are…

1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=shocked,Aww… I thought we were going to have a “headgear stays on heads and doesn’t come off even in strip poker” kind of aesthetic going.

1-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=triumphant,Looks like we have an incest kink here tonight. You're <i>dirty</i> ~player~.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=gremlin,That's <i>so</i> cool. I guess a Stand is another word for a Persona. Mine's called Necronomicon!
1-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=happy,So what are Neighbors? Are those like Shadows? What kind of Personas does your team use?

1-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=excited,I-is this doing it or anyone else?
1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=triumphant,Oh… <i>combat visor</i>. Like <i>thights</i>. We understand each other, yes we do, Oathkeeper! I’d rather have you on my team than some of the <i>dumber</i> Phantom Thieves for sure.
1-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1,count-phantom_thieves:2-3=gremlin,That's <i>so</i> cool. I guess a Stand is another word for a Persona. Did you guys know there were other people still like us!?
1-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=disappointed,Aww... that's it, Skull? Who am I playing with, Noir?
1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=excited,I can call you Nines, because you asked, right? Urnrhrugh. You have to have a better codename…

1-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:akko,count-phantom_thieves:2=awkward,I kind of hope you and Akko aren't here to hook up. I-I don't really think I'd do that with my friend. Who is also here.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:5=shocked,Whoa! You’re like a giant Mona!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:5=interested,What’s so weird about that? Lots of people love catgirls.

1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=excited,Er, could I be a little... <i>taller</i>?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:1=excited,You kind of remind me of Inari. He's an overaccessorized guy like you. Really caught up in fancy artsy stuff.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=shocked,THIS. IS. FASCINATING.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=happy,Don’t worry, smart people like us usually are!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=awkward,Oh. Huh. I figured your gravity stuff was from a Persona or something...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=disappointed,Oh. Well, I guess it could be like a costume from a superhero show or a sentai episode or something...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=awkward,Joker’s old homeroom teacher used to do that too.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:2=interested,I would’ve figured you’d have gotten something with heels.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:2=awkward,You know, I kind of liked being in my Phantom Thief costume, but you always seemed so eager to get out of yours.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:2,marker:personapunann=happy,You’re looking awfully red, Ann! Something, Carmen-dine?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=annoyed,Well, I <i>guess</i> you could just go and b-b-be modest.

1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:ann=annoyed,Really? There's no need to gussy it up. Ann wears nice stuff all the time...
1-female_removing_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:0=shocked,Wait. Are you just me? No, of course not... Hrmmm... Would the Metaverse have made a copy... Or am <i>I</i> a copy?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=shocked,Wait a second... Revy... of the Black Lagoon. Ohmygod. You. Know. Greenback. Jane.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1=happy,I guess I usually just use my headphones to keep my hair in place. I hadn't thought about it like that...

1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=triumphant,Though maybe if you ripped off that mask, there would be something interesting underneath?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=annoyed,I warned you!
1-female_removing_accessory,alsoPlaying:ann,marker:annplaying=interested,I mean, I've seen Makoto and Haru undress. And Ann too! But I'm n-n-not really into models. Or girls.

1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested,Your tie, huh?
1-female_removing_accessory,notSaidMarker:annplaying=interested,I mean, I’ve seen Ann, Makoto, and Haru undress. And I know them well! So, in the spirit of making new friends, you should <i>at least</i> take off your pants.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1=shocked,Er…
1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=interested,I hear that there's an infamous hacker group out there...

1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:haru=annoyed,Really? There's no need to gussy it up. Haru has some really fancy stuff too, and she doesn't even ever wear it!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:0=mad,Hmm... I don’t know what dust is, but it sounds like drugs. Haru is much more legitimate! Don’t you corrupt her!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=nyoro,You really dressed up for this! But why? I just came in casual stuff.
1-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=shocked,Your headphones? What!?

1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=interested,Hm! I've done something different with the panties <i>I'm totally</i> wearing, but showing off those panties is a great move!
1-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=shocked,Y-you know, a Persona? Like... mine is Necronomicon, of the Hermit arcana?
1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:2b,alsoPlaying:marinette=shocked,It <i>does</i> look like Tron! B-but I don't have my computer or Persona here. So I can't do anything. Well, besides watch.

1-female_removing_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:0=annoyed,It’s like playing with a female Ryuji with huge boobs.

1-female_removed_accessory=disappointed,Are you suuuuuuuure that counts?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=triumphant,One down, Saki! Show us your boobs! (There! This will surely help her build confidence.)
1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=triumphant,Come here, Saki! ~player~ can't stare at both of us if you're so far away! (There, now we can be awkward together!)
1-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=interested,Based on what I’ve heard though, you certainly are…
1-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:3=awkward,O-oh. S-sorry, Pinkie. I definitely missed your notes. I was a little distracted.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:3=annoyed,If the headphones mattered to you, you’d leave them on no matter what, D.va!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=triumphant,I swear, if you introduce me, I’ll throw this game in a heartbeat. Maybe.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=interested,Don't worry, Chiaki! You're still well above half... (Unless she's also not wearing...)
1-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:haru=happy,Wow, Haru, Ochako's more uncomfortable taking her suit off than <i>you</i> are. She's probably even more vanilla, too!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=gremlin,Oh. You don't get it. Um... so... that's... interesting. Talking clothes...?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,marker:mahiru_flexible=happy,Your boyfriends must appreciate how flexible you are... I um... prefer to be flexible in coding or party roles. Exercise is hard!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,marker:mahiru_underwear=interested,Oh! Are you not wearing underwear, Mahiru? You showed all of your butt! Makoto would be super jealous!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=awkward,Hmm... Maybe I should pet the kitty?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=shocked,Aww! You’re a kitty-cat! Just like Mona!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=triumphant,You're still in the fight, Ryuko!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, our thigh highs match!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=happy,Aw. At least we have similar styles...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4=happy,Well, you seem to be <i>far</i> shyer about this than even my good friend <i>Haru!</i> And she can be kind of prude. Like, she's into <i>femdom</i> at her kinkiest.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=disappointed,Aww... Fiiine, I guess.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=disappointed,Well you're wrecking up my interest, Ochako.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=shocked,Damn it! And I don’t have Necronomicon to assist.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:2=calm,I think it looks good. It's not like it's super greasy or anything.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=annoyed,Hmm...What’s up with you, Marinette? I wonder...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=nyoro,With computers, anyway.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:1=triumphant,You know, <i>this</i> is a game, and you <i>are</i> a robot AI challenging me, Alpha!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=triumphant,Or maybe you're just kind of cursed in general...? Anyway, back to the game!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2=awkward,Come <i>onnnn</i> Sola! You're being so modest! When I was in high school... er... well... nevermind.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=interested,I think that’s another Megami Tensei game though...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,saidMarker:ryukodename=triumphant,Stick with it, Pathfinder! More support's on the way! Between Mako and I, you'll be unstoppable! <i>Thermopylae!</i>
1-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=awkward,Er... I'm not really sure if that's in character for us to know about each other's worlds...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:meia=awkward,Er. Wait, doesn’t Rei have red eyes? Um. Sorry for the confusion.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:2=calm,Have  to pay attention to you!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy=triumphant,Wow! Cammy's awesome!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy=triumphant,O.M.G. Cammy! Show me your moves! Like. Again. Please.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy=awkward,W-wow! If you want me to sit on your shoulder like a ring-card girl um... rwegrherm. Nevermind. Good job!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=interested,She'll keep her camera on the whole time? Right? Right?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=shocked,Aww... she seems resistant to curse! This is... weird...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=mad,Haru would never flee like that!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=happy,They're so tight you can see <i>everything</i>, can't you?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=gremlin,But you <i>are</i> wearing underwear, if I can see your leg right. Mwehehe. It seems I still have <i>some</i> sexy advantage...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=interested,You said you were a pony? That explains the eyes... And purple.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:1=triumphant,Has anyone ever told you you’re top-heavy? Which is surprising because your brain doesn’t seem impressive.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:5,saidMarker:annlingerie=annoyed,Er. Not that I wore them tonight.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=annoyed,Wait a second... we're both short... do you happen to like anime and manga?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba,saidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba=interested,Oh... yeah, okay, that does seem to be more Saki's... speed, huh, Marinette. And what huh? Okay sure, what are w-w-we all doing?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=excited,I would love to study you! In the sexy way or the science way. The scienexy way!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=happy,Hmm... If you’re interested, I know someone who might be perfect for you, Videl!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jane=triumphant,Unlike, psssst... (The art students.)
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=awkward,I-I want to learn how to flirt. B-b-but this seems like a lootbox. Nobody knows what they're getting from you, Jura.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:3,saidMarker:personapunann=interested,Get it. Becuase your Persona was Carmen… And it’s a red color? And you’re wearing… Red stockings.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:3=happy,Hmm. Do you like the stockings with the toes, Ann? I’m a big fan!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:3=awkward,I-I have to admit, Ann, I’ve always envied you. You’ve always been so m-m-much more outgoing.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1=awkward,I wonder what’s under your mask?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1=disappointed,Why are people so complicated?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:2=excited,I see you’re not just smart, Annie! I’m still gonna make you g-g-go down though! S-see? I can be sexy!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:2=nyoro,I want to win, but watching you lose seems fun too, Raven! C'mon, let's talk about music, I bet we'd get along!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=shocked,I w-w-wasn't staring! I was deep in thought. Very deep. Very thought. Mheemhrmndnm!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,count-bodysuit:1-2=happy,They're so tight you can see <i>everything</i>, can't you? Like our friend over there, you can see all of them, right? Mwehehe.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=disappointed,Hrhrmghrmhgn. I get wanting to be sexy... but you're really showing off...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:2=interested,Sorry if I get a little mean, I know you’re really following the rules closely. Let’s definitely hang out after this.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=triumphant,<i>I</i> sure hope it's not on TV. I want this to be something exclusive!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:merula,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:haru=gremlin,...or maybe you'd rather someone else tie you up? Haru, don't you think Merula's just been <i>so</i> bad?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=awkward,D-d-don't cry, Saki! It's just a game! (Is this a ploy to seem really innocent, or is she just...?)
1-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1=triumphant,Something hard? I hope?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:ann=triumphant,Ann, Mahiru might've made a good Phantom Thief! She shows off her butt like you do! And has a camera and stuff. Mwehehehe.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=calm,Maybe not. But you’d definitely look better with longer stockings! Short socks are no fun.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=disappointed,You artsy types tend to know each other, is all.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=nyoro,I hope you aren't showing off your feet for the foot fetishists, Jura... T-though...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1=interested,IF THESE ARE REAL PLEASE TELL ME HOW TO GET INVOLVED.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:merula,targetStage:3=gremlin,...or maybe you'd rather someone else tie you up?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=gremlin,See, if I wore a skirt, maybe I'd do that all the time. <i>Maybe</i>. If I weren't awkward.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:5=happy,Well, your stockings looked classy, Ann!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:5=awkward,We all know you’re stacked, so at least what’s next isn’t a surprise!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette=triumphant,Unlike, psssst... (The art students.)
1-female_removed_accessory,target:merula,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:ann=gremlin,...or maybe you'd rather someone else tie you up? Ann, don't you think Merula's just been <i>so</i> bad?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=annoyed,Alice Rabbit or something? C'mon if you're going to do a children's story as your motif, do The Once and Future King or something...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1=calm,You’re both kind and determined...But I think she’s a bit braver…
1-female_removed_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1=interested,Hm. Maybe I should try on a maid outfit at some point? Hmmmm…
1-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1=annoyed,It's no good doing all this heroic stuff if you don't look like a hero, you know?
1-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3=triumphant,I've got it! My Persona was Necronomicon, so Monika's codename should be Nyarlathotep!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:1=triumphant,Mwehehe. Don't get too flustered, Haru!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:burns=awkward,I-I-I guess I wouldn't want to be made fun of for my... um... experiences... so, okay.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:pinka_start,targetNotSaidMarker:pinka_end2=annoyed,Uhghghnhrnhgmghm...
1-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:6=awkward,S-sure thing, <i>s-senpai.</i>
1-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:2=triumphant,But I think you're doing great!
1-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4=awkward,I don't mind listening to your music, but that's... very close to someone else, Miko.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1=awkward,I-I'd probably not get the tattoo though. I'm a little afraid of doctors.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=happy,He even has a sword kind of like yours. I um. Don't know if I'd let him undress me... in a game like this, anyway.
1-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=awkward,Hm... I just got the feeling I know you from somewhere... I was just so into your Persona...


#lost boots
2-male_removing_accessory=awkward,My poor feet are cold, ~name~, can you be a bit more considerate?
2-male_removing_accessory=shocked,I thought boys were supposed to like feet, for some reason. Can’t you show that appreciation?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=triumphant,As they say on the internet: "Incest is the best, put your sibling to the test!"
2-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:0=triumphant,<i>You have a Persona!</i> Jotaro, what's your Persona's name!? Did I hear you call on the Star Arcana?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=interested,Are you a Persona user, Nines?
2-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:0,count-persona_5:2-3=triumphant,<i>You have a Persona!</i> Look, everyone! He has a Persona!
2-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:0=interested,Okay, those are pretty cool...
2-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=triumphant,It's really cool to watch! It's like woo-boom-wah-ora-ora-ora!
2-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=interested,I think I've seen this plot twist before...
2-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=happy,Aww, but you're so fun to mess with! Well... not as fun Yusuke to mess with. I'm just glad you're here and not him!
2-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=annoyed,Okay, something small... But it <i>is</i> a weapon... I'm usually more of a support-type player...
2-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=shocked,Aww… I thought we were going to have a “headgear stays on heads and doesn’t come off even in strip poker” kind of aesthetic going.
2-male_removing_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=happy,One made from a lot of anime designs?
2-male_removed_accessory=annoyed,Boooo.
2-male_removed_accessory=mad,Blargh. Fine, ~name~, but when you lose, remember that I could’ve thrown a few hands!
2-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1=triumphant,Take me to your creator!
2-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=nyoro,I don't know about that, Jotaro... but...
2-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1,count-phantom_thieves:2-3=gremlin,That's <i>so</i> cool. I guess a Stand is another word for a Persona. Did you guys know there were other people still like us!?
2-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:2=shocked,I. WANT. THAT. SWORD! <i>IT'S SO COOL!</i>
2-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=excited,I-is this doing it or anyone else?
2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=triumphant,Oh… <i>combat visor</i>. Like <i>thights</i>. We understand each other, yes we do, Oathkeeper! I’d rather have you on my team than some of the <i>dumber</i> Phantom Thieves for sure.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=excited,I can call you Nines, because you asked, right? Urnrhrugh. You have to have a better codename…
2-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=happy,So what are Neighbors? Are those like Shadows? What kind of Personas does your team use?
2-male_removed_accessory,alsoPlaying:ryuji,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:futabafriendship,notSaidMarker:ryujifriendship,marker:ryujifriendship=awkward,<i>W-what</i>? I'd never spy-- er...

2-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=disappointed,Aww... that's it, Skull? Who am I playing with, Noir?
2-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:hifumi=happy,Hifumi! His Persona's even got the Star Arcana, like you! Or so Joker tells me.
2-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=gremlin,That's <i>so</i> cool. I guess a Stand is another word for a Persona. Mine's called Necronomicon!
2-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=triumphant,Looks like we have an incest kink here tonight. You're <i>dirty</i> ~player~.
2-female_removing_accessory=excited,Oh! Good, ~name~! Something frivolous.
2-female_removing_accessory=interested,~Name~, is your plan to pretend to be embarrassed?
2-female_removing_accessory=mad,~Name~, did you “forget” that you had that until now?
2-female_removing_accessory=annoyed,~Name~! Something like that belongs at home, not at the Inventory!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=shocked,What!? You've got pretty good balance to just lift up like that!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1=happy,I guess I usually just use my headphones to keep my hair in place. I hadn't thought about it like that...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=excited,Um... that's kinda hot, but kinda... I dunno if I want pictures out there... I don't <i>don't</i> want pictures though!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=excited,Magatama? I feel like I’ve heard that term before…

2-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy=shocked,W-wait, you aren't supposed to do that here!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:0=triumphant,I <i>loved</i> Evangelion! You were so cool!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:0=annoyed,It’s like playing with a female Ryuji with huge boobs.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=interested,<i>Especially those plugsuits!</i>
2-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:0=mad,Hmm... I don’t know what dust is, but it sounds like drugs. Haru is much more legitimate! Don’t you corrupt her!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=mad,You don’t really use your head a lot, just... brawn?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=disappointed,Though, really, you should've kept your headphones. I'm keeping mine up to the very end.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:0=shocked,Wait. Are you just me? No, of course not... Hrmmm... Would the Metaverse have made a copy... Or am <i>I</i> a copy?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:2=awkward,I dunno... she is kind of hacking... but I can only see it in short glimpses...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=triumphant,Though maybe if you ripped off that mask, there would be something interesting underneath?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=interested,I guess you could <i>be</i> cursed?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=triumphant,Nice! Saki! That's <i>very</i> clever and sexy, showing off your panties like that!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=interested,Hm! I've done something different with the panties <i>I'm totally</i> wearing, but showing off those panties is a great move!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=annoyed,<i>Seriously</i>?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:1=excited,You kind of remind me of Inari. He's an overaccessorized guy like you. Really caught up in fancy artsy stuff.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=excited,I feel like you two would get along.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:4,saidMarker:annlingerie=interested,Um, I guess this is a lot different. Though I appreciate you helping me pick out sexy underwear in the past!

2-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:0,count-phantom_thieves:1=interested,I didn't even <i>think</i> about bringing friends here. It would be kind of fun to see some of them naked...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:2b,alsoPlaying:marinette=shocked,It <i>does</i> look like Tron! B-but I don't have my computer or Persona here. So I can't do anything. Well, besides watch.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=shocked,W-w-wait, hey! You don’t have a Goho-M!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:akko=awkward,I kind of hope you and Akko aren't here to hook up.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette,count-phantom_thieves:1-2=nyoro,Oh don't be such a noob! If you have magic, you should be a hero, Sola!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:haru=annoyed,Really? There's no need to gussy it up. Haru has some really fancy stuff too, and she doesn't even ever wear it!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=triumphant,Yeah! What she said!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:ann=annoyed,Really? There's no need to gussy it up. Ann wears nice stuff all the time...

2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:hifumi=annoyed,Hifumi, are you seeing this? I get that her stuff is fancy, but being comfy is important too, isn't it?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,saidMarker:ryuko_mako=mad,W-what? Don't be mean to your friend! She even offered to get naked with you!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:0=happy,I like you even more than Hatsune Miku! Mostly because of the porn. But you know, the music too!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:2=interested,I would’ve figured you’d have gotten something with heels.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:2=awkward,You know, I kind of liked being in my Phantom Thief costume, but you always seemed so eager to get out of yours.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:2,marker:personapunann=happy,You’re looking awfully red, Ann! Something, Carmen-dine?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=mad,W-w-what? Come on! No fair!

2-female_removing_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:0=interested,Sensible... I guess it's not like we can see your underwear. But I think I see a cameltoe!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1=shocked,Er…

2-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=shocked,Your headphones? What!?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=awkward,I never thought about making a living doing it... I’m not much one for the spotlight.

2-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=triumphant,Buffing Chiaki's wetness!

2-female_removing_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:5=shocked,Whoa! You’re like a giant Mona!

2-female_removing_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1=excited,Clever, flashing your panties like that.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:0=interested,Annie! What do you study?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=triumphant,Mwehehe. This'll teach you to call me a knockoff!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=disappointed,I'm not <i>really</i> into girls but you're really drawing this out, Ochako...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1=awkward,I had a lot of trouble getting out until recently too but...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=awkward,Oh. Huh. I figured your gravity stuff was from a Persona or something...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=disappointed,Oh. Well, I guess it could be like a costume from a superhero show or a sentai episode or something...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=shocked,Y-you know, a Persona? Like... mine is Necronomicon, of the Hermit arcana?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=shocked,THIS. IS. FASCINATING.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=excited,Er, could I be a little... <i>taller</i>?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:pinka_start,targetNotSaidMarker:pinka_end2=awkward,...unless you count harsh language, I don't want her to aggro to me.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=triumphant,I knew I came to the right game!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=interested,I hear that there's an infamous hacker group out there...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=annoyed,I warned you!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0=gremlin,I'm kind of a wizard myself. Digitally.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=happy,Don’t worry, smart people like us usually are!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=excited,Just b-b-because you have big boobs d-d-doesn’t mean--
2-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=shocked,I-I mean. I wouldn't o-o-overcompensate. For shyness. By being a gremlin. N-no way!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=shocked,Wait a second... Revy... of the Black Lagoon. Ohmygod. You. Know. Greenback. Jane.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=triumphant,Comet storm?! Can you show us!?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=triumphant,A comet storm?! That's sounds super cool! I wish I could see your power meter charging...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:0=shocked,!!!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=awkward,Joker’s old homeroom teacher used to do that too.
2-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:3=awkward,An old friend of mine... But he was a cat...
2-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1=interested,That's a really cool belt though. I like your outfit. So gothy and metal!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:0=calm,Where'd you get that stuff? Online!? Please tell me it was from somewhere online!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested,Hey, Saki, is that tie of yours part of a school uniform?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested,Your tie, huh?
2-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2=excited,(<i>I-it's just her shoes, so why am I-- I--I mean, she is pretty cute and so... confident.</i>)
2-female_removing_accessory,target:ruby,targetStage:0=happy,Well, at least you’re fun to play with, Ruby!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=annoyed,Quick, someone use  <i>bless</i> spells before she brainwashes everyone!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:5=shocked,Um... I just came here to flirt and <i>act</i> sexy, but I kind of... wow, Pinkie! You're really good at all of this!
2-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=annoyed,Well, I <i>guess</i> you could just go and b-b-be modest.
2-female_removed_accessory=triumphant,I could bounce a coin off the exposed skin you have. It’d hurt, but that’s what you get for not removing more.
2-female_removed_accessory=shocked,~Name~... Urghlugh. Why are you being lame?
2-female_removed_accessory=awkward,I mean, I’m making my way towards actually getting naked, ~name~. Are you just teasing?
2-female_removed_accessory=happy,Alright! ~name~ should be out of shields now!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,saidMarker:ryukodename=triumphant,Stick with it, Pathfinder! More support's on the way! Between Mako and I, you'll be unstoppable! <i>Thermopylae!</i>
2-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=mad,Haru would never flee like that!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=nyoro,I hope you aren't showing off your feet for the foot fetishists, Jura... T-though...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2=awkward,Come <i>onnnn</i> Sola! You're being so modest! When I was in high school... er... well... nevermind.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:merula,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:ann=gremlin,...or maybe you'd rather someone else tie you up? Ann, don't you think Merula's just been <i>so</i> bad?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=interested,She'll keep her camera on the whole time? Right? Right?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=excited,I would love to study you! In the sexy way or the science way. The scienexy way!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=interested,You said you were a pony? That explains the eyes... And purple.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette=triumphant,Unlike, psssst... (The art students.)
2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4=happy,Well, you seem to be <i>far</i> shyer about this than even my good friend <i>Haru!</i> And she can be kind of prude. Like, she's into <i>femdom</i> at her kinkiest.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:ann=triumphant,Ann, Mahiru might've made a good Phantom Thief! She shows off her butt like you do! And has a camera and stuff. Mwehehehe.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=disappointed,Aww... Fiiine, I guess.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=disappointed,Well you're wrecking up my interest, Ochako.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:haru=happy,Wow, Haru, Ochako's more uncomfortable taking her suit off than <i>you</i> are. She's probably even more vanilla, too!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3=triumphant,I've got it! My Persona was Necronomicon, so Monika's codename should be Nyarlathotep!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:pinka_start,targetNotSaidMarker:pinka_end2=annoyed,Uhghghnhrnhgmghm...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=annoyed,Hmm...What’s up with you, Marinette? I wonder...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=disappointed,Hrhrmghrmhgn. I get wanting to be sexy... but you're really showing off...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=triumphant,<i>I</i> sure hope it's not on TV. I want this to be something exclusive!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:3,saidMarker:personapunann=interested,Get it. Becuase your Persona was Carmen… And it’s a red color? And you’re wearing… Red stockings.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=nyoro,With computers, anyway.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:5,saidMarker:annlingerie=annoyed,Er. Not that I wore them tonight.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=shocked,Damn it! And I don’t have Necronomicon to assist.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,count-bodysuit:1-2=happy,They're so tight you can see <i>everything</i>, can't you? Like our friend over there, you can see all of them, right? Mwehehe.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:1=triumphant,You know, <i>this</i> is a game, and you <i>are</i> a robot AI challenging me, Alpha!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:burns=awkward,I-I-I guess I wouldn't want to be made fun of for my... um... experiences... so, okay.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=annoyed,Alice Rabbit or something? C'mon if you're going to do a children's story as your motif, do The Once and Future King or something...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=calm,Maybe not. But you’d definitely look better with longer stockings! Short socks are no fun.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=awkward,Hm... I just got the feeling I know you from somewhere... I was just so into your Persona...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1=annoyed,It's no good doing all this heroic stuff if you don't look like a hero, you know?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1=calm,You’re both kind and determined...But I think she’s a bit braver…
2-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1=disappointed,Why are people so complicated?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:2=nyoro,I want to win, but watching you lose seems fun too, Raven! C'mon, let's talk about music, I bet we'd get along!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=triumphant,I swear, if you introduce me, I’ll throw this game in a heartbeat. Maybe.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:3=annoyed,If the headphones mattered to you, you’d leave them on no matter what, D.va!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,marker:mahiru_flexible=happy,Your boyfriends must appreciate how flexible you are... I um... prefer to be flexible in coding or party roles. Exercise is hard!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,marker:mahiru_underwear=interested,Oh! Are you not wearing underwear, Mahiru? You showed all of your butt! Makoto would be super jealous!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:2=interested,Sorry if I get a little mean, I know you’re really following the rules closely. Let’s definitely hang out after this.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=annoyed,Wait a second... we're both short... do you happen to like anime and manga?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=interested,Based on what I’ve heard though, you certainly are…
2-female_removed_accessory,target:merula,targetStage:3=gremlin,...or maybe you'd rather someone else tie you up?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=interested,Don't worry, Chiaki! You're still well above half... (Unless she's also not wearing...)
2-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=happy,He even has a sword kind of like yours. I um. Don't know if I'd let him undress me... in a game like this, anyway.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=gremlin,Oh. You don't get it. Um... so... that's... interesting. Talking clothes...?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:1=triumphant,Mwehehe. Don't get too flustered, Haru!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:3=happy,Hmm. Do you like the stockings with the toes, Ann? I’m a big fan!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:3=awkward,I-I have to admit, Ann, I’ve always envied you. You’ve always been so m-m-much more outgoing.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=gremlin,But you <i>are</i> wearing underwear, if I can see your leg right. Mwehehe. It seems I still have <i>some</i> sexy advantage...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=gremlin,See, if I wore a skirt, maybe I'd do that all the time. <i>Maybe</i>. If I weren't awkward.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1=interested,IF THESE ARE REAL PLEASE TELL ME HOW TO GET INVOLVED.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:5=happy,Well, your stockings looked classy, Ann!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:5=awkward,We all know you’re stacked, so at least what’s next isn’t a surprise!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1=triumphant,Something hard? I hope?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:2=calm,Have  to pay attention to you!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=awkward,D-d-don't cry, Saki! It's just a game! (Is this a ploy to seem really innocent, or is she just...?)
2-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:3=awkward,O-oh. S-sorry, Pinkie. I definitely missed your notes. I was a little distracted.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=triumphant,One down, Saki! Show us your boobs! (There! This will surely help her build confidence.)
2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=triumphant,Come here, Saki! ~player~ can't stare at both of us if you're so far away! (There, now we can be awkward together!)
2-female_removed_accessory,target:merula,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:haru=gremlin,...or maybe you'd rather someone else tie you up? Haru, don't you think Merula's just been <i>so</i> bad?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=awkward,Hmm... Maybe I should pet the kitty?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=shocked,Aww! You’re a kitty-cat! Just like Mona!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=triumphant,You're still in the fight, Ryuko!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, our thigh highs match!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=happy,Aw. At least we have similar styles...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:2=excited,I see you’re not just smart, Annie! I’m still gonna make you g-g-go down though! S-see? I can be sexy!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=awkward,I-I want to learn how to flirt. B-b-but this seems like a lootbox. Nobody knows what they're getting from you, Jura.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1=interested,Hm. Maybe I should try on a maid outfit at some point? Hmmmm…
2-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4=awkward,I don't mind listening to your music, but that's... very close to someone else, Miko.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1=awkward,I-I'd probably not get the tattoo though. I'm a little afraid of doctors.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=happy,Hmm... If you’re interested, I know someone who might be perfect for you, Videl!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=awkward,Er... I'm not really sure if that's in character for us to know about each other's worlds...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=happy,They're so tight you can see <i>everything</i>, can't you?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=disappointed,You artsy types tend to know each other, is all.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:6=awkward,S-sure thing, <i>s-senpai.</i>
2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=triumphant,Or maybe you're just kind of cursed in general...? Anyway, back to the game!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy=triumphant,Wow! Cammy's awesome!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy=triumphant,O.M.G. Cammy! Show me your moves! Like. Again. Please.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy=awkward,W-wow! If you want me to sit on your shoulder like a ring-card girl um... rwegrherm. Nevermind. Good job!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:1=triumphant,Has anyone ever told you you’re top-heavy? Which is surprising because your brain doesn’t seem impressive.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba,saidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba=interested,Oh... yeah, okay, that does seem to be more Saki's... speed, huh, Marinette. And what huh? Okay sure, what are w-w-we all doing?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:2=triumphant,But I think you're doing great!
2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=shocked,Aww... she seems resistant to curse! This is... weird...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:2=calm,I think it looks good. It's not like it's super greasy or anything.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jane=triumphant,Unlike, psssst... (The art students.)
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=interested,I think that’s another Megami Tensei game though...
2-female_removed_accessory,target:meia=awkward,Er. Wait, doesn’t Rei have red eyes? Um. Sorry for the confusion.
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1=awkward,I wonder what’s under your mask?
2-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=shocked,I w-w-wasn't staring! I was deep in thought. Very deep. Very thought. Mheemhrmndnm!


#lost shirt
3-male_removing_accessory=interested,Hey ~name~, aren’t you supposed to speed it up when a girl takes off her shirt?
3-male_removing_accessory=annoyed,~Clothing~! Really? I took off my shirt! Admittedly there’s not much under it but...
3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=shocked,Aww… I thought we were going to have a “headgear stays on heads and doesn’t come off even in strip poker” kind of aesthetic going.
3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=triumphant,As they say on the internet: "Incest is the best, put your sibling to the test!"
3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=interested,I think I've seen this plot twist before...
3-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:0,count-persona_5:2-3=triumphant,<i>You have a Persona!</i> Look, everyone! He has a Persona!
3-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=triumphant,It's really cool to watch! It's like woo-boom-wah-ora-ora-ora!
3-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=happy,Aww, but you're so fun to mess with! Well... not as fun Yusuke to mess with. I'm just glad you're here and not him!
3-male_removing_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=happy,One made from a lot of anime designs?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:0=interested,Okay, those are pretty cool...
3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=interested,Are you a Persona user, Nines?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:0=triumphant,<i>You have a Persona!</i> Jotaro, what's your Persona's name!? Did I hear you call on the Star Arcana?
3-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=annoyed,Okay, something small... But it <i>is</i> a weapon... I'm usually more of a support-type player...
3-male_removed_accessory=disappointed,Ugh, ~name~, stop playing the delaying game.
3-male_removed_accessory=shocked,As a former Phantom Thief, you’ll need a lot more daring to have a chance with. Er. Against. Withagainst me!
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:cheerful,priority:0=mad,I'm glad ~name~ is so cheery, considering how little she's stripping right now.
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:cheerful,priority:0=shocked,I'm glad you're nice and happy, ~name~, but couldn't you take off something a <i>little</i> bigger?
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:tsundere,priority:0=happy,I think ~name~'s only acting like this because she has a crush on someone here. So tsundere.
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:tsundere,priority:0=happy,~Name~, y-y-you know, you're like a cactus. You want people to hug you but you pretend to be so prickly!
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:innocent,priority:0=shocked,~Name~, um. A-are you okay with all this? You seem kind of... sheltered.
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:aggressive,priority:0=annoyed,No need to be so aggressive, ~name~, it's just a game.
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:aggressive,priority:0=awkward,~Name~, you're awfully aggressive, huh?
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:yandere,priority:0=shocked,Whoa, be careful, ~player~, ~name~ has his sights on you!
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:yandere,priority:0=shocked,I-is it just me, or is there something really scary about ~name~?
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:yandere,priority:0=shocked,~Name~ could use a change of heart! And fast!
3-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=happy,So what are Neighbors? Are those like Shadows? What kind of Personas does your team use?
3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=triumphant,Looks like we have an incest kink here tonight. You're <i>dirty</i> ~player~.
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:gloomy,priority:0=disappointed,Aww... don't be sad, ~name~. W-w-we're all here to have fun, after all. R-r-right?
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:ditzy,priority:0=shocked,Careful, ~name~! You could really lose a lot if you aren't!
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:ditzy,priority:0=shocked,W-whoa, ~name~, are you that confident or are you just not paying attention?
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:seductive,priority:0=shocked,W-whoa, ~name~, you could teach me a thing or two about seduction, that's for sure!
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:confident,priority:0=annoyed,Hnrnrnhrurn. You're awfully confident for someone who's taking off small pieces, ~name~.
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:confident,priority:0=awkward,Oh, <i>~Name~'s</i> confident? Well, I'm <i>confident</i> enough to... Hhrmrmrmernmerm. You'll see!
3-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:2=shocked,I. WANT. THAT. SWORD! <i>IT'S SO COOL!</i>
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:shut_in,priority:0=disappointed,I know how it feels to not get out much, ~name~. But we're here at this big game together, so let's try and be cheery, huh?
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:shut_in,priority:0=calm,Don't worry, ~name~! I know what it's like to be stuck at home too. But I got a lot better and so can you. K-keep going with that small stuff, alright?
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:fashionable,priority:0=interested,Er... ~name~, could you take me shopping after this? I bet you'd know exactly what I wanted!
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:fashionable,priority:0=interested,~Name~! We should go on a post-game quest to get me some clothing that matches my style as well as your clothing matches yours!
3-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=excited,He'd make it kind of weird... though maybe... <i>Hmmm....</i>
3-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=gremlin,That's <i>so</i> cool. I guess a Stand is another word for a Persona. Mine's called Necronomicon!
3-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1,count-phantom_thieves:2-3=gremlin,That's <i>so</i> cool. I guess a Stand is another word for a Persona. Did you guys know there were other people still like us!?
3-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:hifumi=happy,Hifumi! His Persona's even got the Star Arcana, like you! Or so Joker tells me.
3-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1=triumphant,Take me to your creator!
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:fancy,priority:0=interested,Oooooooo. ~name~'s ~clothing~ is actually pretty high end! I wonder if Haru would know more aobut that...
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:fancy,priority:0=awkward,Why'd you have to dress up all fancy, ~name~!? I feel really out of place!
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:submissive,priority:0=awkward,~Name~... I don't know how to say this, but you're kind of into being dominated, huh?
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:submissive,priority:0=awkward,I can't say I can't relate to ~name~'s need to be... well... what girl doesn't like to be manhandled a bit? Maybe Haru. She prefers to the handling...
3-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=nyoro,I don't know about that, Jotaro... but...
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:moe,priority:0=awkward,Aww, you're so cute, ~name~. I wish I could pull off that innocent and wide-eyed look...
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:moe,priority:0=awkward,You know, ~name~, I bet we'd get along well! Plus, you'd get to be the cute one, which is... um. Something!
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:nerdy,priority:0=awkward,~Name~, we'd definitely be compatible if you wanted to do stuff after this! Um. Friend stuff though. I-I-I mean, ha-ha! I am definitely into girls too! So sexy. Yes.
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:nerdy,priority:0=triumphant,I'll have you know I <i>really</i> thought about bringing something geeky like your ~clothing~, ~name~!
3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=excited,I-is this doing it or anyone else?
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:perverted,priority:0=triumphant,Awww yissss. ~name~'s definitely into dirty sexy stuff too! E-er, right?
3-male_removed_accessory,filter:perverted,priority:0=awkward,~Name~'s kind of overt in her attentions, but... I don't know, I think that's l-l-like any good strip poker manga, right?

3-female_removed_accessory=triumphant,You probably look better in casual wear, ~name~.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=disappointed,You artsy types tend to know each other, is all.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=disappointed,Hrhrmghrmhgn. I get wanting to be sexy... but you're really showing off...

3-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1=calm,You’re both kind and determined...But I think she’s a bit braver…
3-female_removed_accessory,target:merula,targetStage:3=gremlin,...or maybe you'd rather someone else tie you up?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=awkward,Er... I'm not really sure if that's in character for us to know about each other's worlds...
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=interested,I think that’s another Megami Tensei game though...

3-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,marker:mahiru_underwear=interested,Oh! Are you not wearing underwear, Mahiru? You showed all of your butt! Makoto would be super jealous!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=triumphant,Or maybe you're just kind of cursed in general...? Anyway, back to the game!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=shocked,Damn it! And I don’t have Necronomicon to assist.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=nyoro,I hope you aren't showing off your feet for the foot fetishists, Jura... T-though...

3-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3=triumphant,I've got it! My Persona was Necronomicon, so Monika's codename should be Nyarlathotep!
3-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:2=calm,I think it looks good. It's not like it's super greasy or anything.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1=awkward,I wonder what’s under your mask?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=gremlin,But you <i>are</i> wearing underwear, if I can see your leg right. Mwehehe. It seems I still have <i>some</i> sexy advantage...

3-female_removed_accessory,filter:lonely,priority:0=disappointed,Aww, ~name~, do you just... Did you come here to just make friends? I was here for the XP, but... I can relate a little.

3-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=happy,He even has a sword kind of like yours. I um. Don't know if I'd let him undress me... in a game like this, anyway.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=interested,Don't worry, Chiaki! You're still well above half... (Unless she's also not wearing...)

3-female_removed_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:2=interested,Sorry if I get a little mean, I know you’re really following the rules closely. Let’s definitely hang out after this.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=triumphant,I swear, if you introduce me, I’ll throw this game in a heartbeat. Maybe.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:3=annoyed,If the headphones mattered to you, you’d leave them on no matter what, D.va!

3-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1=disappointed,Why are people so complicated?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1=annoyed,It's no good doing all this heroic stuff if you don't look like a hero, you know?
3-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=calm,Maybe not. But you’d definitely look better with longer stockings! Short socks are no fun.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1=interested,IF THESE ARE REAL PLEASE TELL ME HOW TO GET INVOLVED.
3-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:3=happy,Hmm. Do you like the stockings with the toes, Ann? I’m a big fan!

3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=annoyed,Alice Rabbit or something? C'mon if you're going to do a children's story as your motif, do The Once and Future King or something...

4-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:0=triumphant,<i>You have a Persona!</i> Jotaro, what's your Persona's name!? Did I hear you call on the Star Arcana?
4-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=triumphant,As they say on the internet: "Incest is the best, put your sibling to the test!"
4-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=shocked,Aww… I thought we were going to have a “headgear stays on heads and doesn’t come off even in strip poker” kind of aesthetic going.
4-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:0=interested,Okay, those are pretty cool...
4-male_removed_accessory=disappointed,... Boring.
4-male_removed_accessory=awkward,~Name~, you and everyone else might not know this, but I’m not wearing anything under what I’m wearing now because I thought it’d be in the spirit of the game and you’re really bringing me down by being so... rugffrnughn.

4-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=gremlin,That's <i>so</i> cool. I guess a Stand is another word for a Persona. Mine's called Necronomicon!

4-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1=triumphant,Take me to your creator!
4-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=happy,So what are Neighbors? Are those like Shadows? What kind of Personas does your team use?

4-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=mad,W-w-what? Come on! No fair!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=disappointed,Though, really, you should've kept your headphones. I'm keeping mine up to the very end.

4-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:haru=annoyed,Really? There's no need to gussy it up. Haru has some really fancy stuff too, and she doesn't even ever wear it!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,saidMarker:ryuko_mako=mad,W-what? Don't be mean to your friend! She even offered to get naked with you!
4-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=annoyed,Well, I <i>guess</i> you could just go and b-b-be modest.
4-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=annoyed,I warned you!
4-female_removed_accessory=shocked,I’m leaving on my glasses and headphones! It’s rude not to at least try to strip.
4-female_removed_accessory=disappointed,I’m taking a big step forward to be here. You could at least play politely.
4-female_removed_accessory=mad,Ugh, ~name~, I don’t think I’m misunderstanding the rules.
4-female_removed_accessory=annoyed,I’m good at games, ~name~! Why don’t you want to follow the rules? I’m not even cheating when it would be <i>super</i> easy with people like you!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette=triumphant,Unlike, psssst... (The art students.)
4-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,saidMarker:ryukodename=triumphant,Stick with it, Pathfinder! More support's on the way! Between Mako and I, you'll be unstoppable! <i>Thermopylae!</i>
4-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,count-bodysuit:1-2=happy,They're so tight you can see <i>everything</i>, can't you? Like our friend over there, you can see all of them, right? Mwehehe.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4=happy,Well, you seem to be <i>far</i> shyer about this than even my good friend <i>Haru!</i> And she can be kind of prude. Like, she's into <i>femdom</i> at her kinkiest.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, our thigh highs match!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=happy,Aw. At least we have similar styles...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=awkward,Hmm... Maybe I should pet the kitty?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=shocked,Aww! You’re a kitty-cat! Just like Mona!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=gremlin,Oh. You don't get it. Um... so... that's... interesting. Talking clothes...?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:ann=triumphant,Ann, Mahiru might've made a good Phantom Thief! She shows off her butt like you do! And has a camera and stuff. Mwehehehe.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=triumphant,<i>I</i> sure hope it's not on TV. I want this to be something exclusive!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1=awkward,I-I'd probably not get the tattoo though. I'm a little afraid of doctors.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=interested,Don't worry, Chiaki! You're still well above half... (Unless she's also not wearing...)
4-female_removed_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:2=interested,Sorry if I get a little mean, I know you’re really following the rules closely. Let’s definitely hang out after this.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=triumphant,You're still in the fight, Ryuko!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=excited,I would love to study you! In the sexy way or the science way. The scienexy way!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jane=triumphant,Unlike, psssst... (The art students.)
4-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=gremlin,See, if I wore a skirt, maybe I'd do that all the time. <i>Maybe</i>. If I weren't awkward.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=awkward,W-w-with my fingers. Um. Sorry, trying to be sexy.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2=awkward,Come <i>onnnn</i> Sola! You're being so modest! When I was in high school... er... well... nevermind.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:1=triumphant,You know, <i>this</i> is a game, and you <i>are</i> a robot AI challenging me, Alpha!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:1=triumphant,Has anyone ever told you you’re top-heavy? Which is surprising because your brain doesn’t seem impressive.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=annoyed,Alice Rabbit or something? C'mon if you're going to do a children's story as your motif, do The Once and Future King or something...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=mad,Haru would never flee like that!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:3=happy,Hmm. Do you like the stockings with the toes, Ann? I’m a big fan!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:3=awkward,I-I have to admit, Ann, I’ve always envied you. You’ve always been so m-m-much more outgoing.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy=triumphant,Wow! Cammy's awesome!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy=triumphant,O.M.G. Cammy! Show me your moves! Like. Again. Please.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy=awkward,W-wow! If you want me to sit on your shoulder like a ring-card girl um... rwegrherm. Nevermind. Good job!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=awkward,Hm... I just got the feeling I know you from somewhere... I was just so into your Persona...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:2=triumphant,But I think you're doing great!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1=interested,IF THESE ARE REAL PLEASE TELL ME HOW TO GET INVOLVED.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:3,saidMarker:personapunann=interested,Get it. Becuase your Persona was Carmen… And it’s a red color? And you’re wearing… Red stockings.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=interested,She'll keep her camera on the whole time? Right? Right?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba,saidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba=interested,Oh... yeah, okay, that does seem to be more Saki's... speed, huh, Marinette. And what huh? Okay sure, what are w-w-we all doing?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=happy,Hmm... If you’re interested, I know someone who might be perfect for you, Videl!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:6=awkward,S-sure thing, <i>s-senpai.</i>
4-female_removed_accessory,target:meia=awkward,Er. Wait, doesn’t Rei have red eyes? Um. Sorry for the confusion.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:5,saidMarker:annlingerie=annoyed,Er. Not that I wore them tonight.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=interested,You said you were a pony? That explains the eyes... And purple.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=awkward,D-d-don't cry, Saki! It's just a game! (Is this a ploy to seem really innocent, or is she just...?)
4-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1=triumphant,Something hard? I hope?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:2=excited,I see you’re not just smart, Annie! I’m still gonna make you g-g-go down though! S-see? I can be sexy!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=happy,He even has a sword kind of like yours. I um. Don't know if I'd let him undress me... in a game like this, anyway.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=triumphant,One down, Saki! Show us your boobs! (There! This will surely help her build confidence.)
4-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=triumphant,Come here, Saki! ~player~ can't stare at both of us if you're so far away! (There, now we can be awkward together!)
4-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:5=happy,Well, your stockings looked classy, Ann!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:5=awkward,We all know you’re stacked, so at least what’s next isn’t a surprise!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:3=annoyed,If the headphones mattered to you, you’d leave them on no matter what, D.va!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=disappointed,Aww... Fiiine, I guess.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=disappointed,Well you're wrecking up my interest, Ochako.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=annoyed,Wait a second... we're both short... do you happen to like anime and manga?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:2=calm,I think it looks good. It's not like it's super greasy or anything.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:merula,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:ann=gremlin,...or maybe you'd rather someone else tie you up? Ann, don't you think Merula's just been <i>so</i> bad?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=awkward,Er... I'm not really sure if that's in character for us to know about each other's worlds...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1=awkward,I wonder what’s under your mask?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:1=triumphant,Mwehehe. Don't get too flustered, Haru!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:2=calm,Have  to pay attention to you!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=gremlin,But you <i>are</i> wearing underwear, if I can see your leg right. Mwehehe. It seems I still have <i>some</i> sexy advantage...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:3=awkward,O-oh. S-sorry, Pinkie. I definitely missed your notes. I was a little distracted.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=triumphant,Or maybe you're just kind of cursed in general...? Anyway, back to the game!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1=calm,You’re both kind and determined...But I think she’s a bit braver…
4-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=shocked,Damn it! And I don’t have Necronomicon to assist.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=nyoro,I hope you aren't showing off your feet for the foot fetishists, Jura... T-though...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=interested,Based on what I’ve heard though, you certainly are…
4-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4=awkward,I don't mind listening to your music, but that's... very close to someone else, Miko.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=interested,I think that’s another Megami Tensei game though...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3=triumphant,I've got it! My Persona was Necronomicon, so Monika's codename should be Nyarlathotep!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=disappointed,Hrhrmghrmhgn. I get wanting to be sexy... but you're really showing off...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=happy,They're so tight you can see <i>everything</i>, can't you?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=awkward,I-I want to learn how to flirt. B-b-but this seems like a lootbox. Nobody knows what they're getting from you, Jura.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:burns=awkward,I-I-I guess I wouldn't want to be made fun of for my... um... experiences... so, okay.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:merula,targetStage:3=gremlin,...or maybe you'd rather someone else tie you up?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1=interested,Hm. Maybe I should try on a maid outfit at some point? Hmmmm…
4-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=shocked,Aww... she seems resistant to curse! This is... weird...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=annoyed,Hmm...What’s up with you, Marinette? I wonder...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=calm,Maybe not. But you’d definitely look better with longer stockings! Short socks are no fun.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:pinka_start,targetNotSaidMarker:pinka_end2=annoyed,Uhghghnhrnhgmghm...
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,marker:mahiru_flexible=happy,Your boyfriends must appreciate how flexible you are... I um... prefer to be flexible in coding or party roles. Exercise is hard!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,marker:mahiru_underwear=interested,Oh! Are you not wearing underwear, Mahiru? You showed all of your butt! Makoto would be super jealous!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:haru=happy,Wow, Haru, Ochako's more uncomfortable taking her suit off than <i>you</i> are. She's probably even more vanilla, too!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1=annoyed,It's no good doing all this heroic stuff if you don't look like a hero, you know?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:merula,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:haru=gremlin,...or maybe you'd rather someone else tie you up? Haru, don't you think Merula's just been <i>so</i> bad?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=triumphant,I swear, if you introduce me, I’ll throw this game in a heartbeat. Maybe.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=disappointed,You artsy types tend to know each other, is all.
4-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1=disappointed,Why are people so complicated?
4-female_removed_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:2=nyoro,I want to win, but watching you lose seems fun too, Raven! C'mon, let's talk about music, I bet we'd get along!
4-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=shocked,I w-w-wasn't staring! I was deep in thought. Very deep. Very thought. Mheemhrmndnm!

5-male_removing_accessory=mad,I’m showing you my tits, ~name~!
5-male_removing_accessory=disappointed,I came here because I thought I’d get to see people naked in person...
5-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=interested,Are you a Persona user, Nines?
5-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=triumphant,As they say on the internet: "Incest is the best, put your sibling to the test!"
5-male_removing_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=happy,One made from a lot of anime designs?
5-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:0,count-persona_5:2-3=triumphant,<i>You have a Persona!</i> Look, everyone! He has a Persona!
5-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=happy,Aww, but you're so fun to mess with! Well... not as fun Yusuke to mess with. I'm just glad you're here and not him!
5-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=triumphant,It's really cool to watch! It's like woo-boom-wah-ora-ora-ora!
5-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:0=triumphant,<i>You have a Persona!</i> Jotaro, what's your Persona's name!? Did I hear you call on the Star Arcana?
5-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=shocked,Aww… I thought we were going to have a “headgear stays on heads and doesn’t come off even in strip poker” kind of aesthetic going.
5-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:0=interested,Okay, those are pretty cool...
5-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=interested,I think I've seen this plot twist before...
5-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=annoyed,Okay, something small... But it <i>is</i> a weapon... I'm usually more of a support-type player...
5-male_removed_accessory=annoyed,E-er not you specifically, but... Stop being stupid!
5-male_removed_accessory=shocked,And that’s all you can muster? Weak!
5-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:hifumi=happy,Hifumi! His Persona's even got the Star Arcana, like you! Or so Joker tells me.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=nyoro,I don't know about that, Jotaro... but...
5-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=excited,I can call you Nines, because you asked, right? Urnrhrugh. You have to have a better codename…
5-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=excited,I-is this doing it or anyone else?
5-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=triumphant,Oh… <i>combat visor</i>. Like <i>thights</i>. We understand each other, yes we do, Oathkeeper! I’d rather have you on my team than some of the <i>dumber</i> Phantom Thieves for sure.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=triumphant,Looks like we have an incest kink here tonight. You're <i>dirty</i> ~player~.
5-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1=triumphant,Take me to your creator!
5-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=gremlin,That's <i>so</i> cool. I guess a Stand is another word for a Persona. Mine's called Necronomicon!
5-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=excited,He'd make it kind of weird... though maybe... <i>Hmmm....</i>
5-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:2=shocked,I. WANT. THAT. SWORD! <i>IT'S SO COOL!</i>
5-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1,count-phantom_thieves:2-3=gremlin,That's <i>so</i> cool. I guess a Stand is another word for a Persona. Did you guys know there were other people still like us!?
5-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=happy,So what are Neighbors? Are those like Shadows? What kind of Personas does your team use?
5-female_removing_accessory=disappointed,Well isn’t ~name~ special.
5-female_removing_accessory=annoyed,Ugh. Why can’t you be normal and wear less frilly nonsense?
5-female_removing_accessory=interested,Hey! I hope my chest isn’t distracting you, ~name~!
5-female_removing_accessory=awkward,I’m...  I...  I prepared to show off and be attractive for this...  Are you making fun of me, ~name~?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:akko=awkward,I kind of hope you and Akko aren't here to hook up.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=annoyed,I warned you!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=shocked,W-w-wait, hey! You don’t have a Goho-M!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:2=awkward,I dunno... she is kind of hacking... but I can only see it in short glimpses...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=interested,<i>Especially those plugsuits!</i>
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:0=shocked,!!!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:0=happy,I like you even more than Hatsune Miku! Mostly because of the porn. But you know, the music too!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:0=calm,Where'd you get that stuff? Online!? Please tell me it was from somewhere online!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,saidMarker:ryuko_mako=mad,W-what? Don't be mean to your friend! She even offered to get naked with you!

5-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=interested,Huh. Going for the upskirt, Chiaki?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested,Hey, Saki, is that tie of yours part of a school uniform?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested,Your tie, huh?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=interested,I hear that there's an infamous hacker group out there...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0=gremlin,I'm kind of a wizard myself. Digitally.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:hifumi=annoyed,Hifumi, are you seeing this? I get that her stuff is fancy, but being comfy is important too, isn't it?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=excited,I feel like you two would get along.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=annoyed,Well, I <i>guess</i> you could just go and b-b-be modest.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:0=shocked,Wait. Are you just me? No, of course not... Hrmmm... Would the Metaverse have made a copy... Or am <i>I</i> a copy?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=disappointed,I'm not <i>really</i> into girls but you're really drawing this out, Ochako...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=excited,Er, could I be a little... <i>taller</i>?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=shocked,Wait a second... Revy... of the Black Lagoon. Ohmygod. You. Know. Greenback. Jane.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=mad,You don’t really use your head a lot, just... brawn?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:4,saidMarker:annlingerie=interested,Um, I guess this is a lot different. Though I appreciate you helping me pick out sexy underwear in the past!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=triumphant,Comet storm?! Can you show us!?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=triumphant,A comet storm?! That's sounds super cool! I wish I could see your power meter charging...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:0,count-phantom_thieves:1=interested,I didn't even <i>think</i> about bringing friends here. It would be kind of fun to see some of them naked...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:0=mad,Hmm... I don’t know what dust is, but it sounds like drugs. Haru is much more legitimate! Don’t you corrupt her!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:5=shocked,Um... I just came here to flirt and <i>act</i> sexy, but I kind of... wow, Pinkie! You're really good at all of this!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:0=interested,Annie! What do you study?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=awkward,Oh. Huh. I figured your gravity stuff was from a Persona or something...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=disappointed,Oh. Well, I guess it could be like a costume from a superhero show or a sentai episode or something...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:1=excited,You kind of remind me of Inari. He's an overaccessorized guy like you. Really caught up in fancy artsy stuff.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:0=annoyed,It’s like playing with a female Ryuji with huge boobs.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1=excited,Clever, flashing your panties like that.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=happy,Don’t worry, smart people like us usually are!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy=shocked,O-oh no! Wait a second!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy=shocked,W-wait, you aren't supposed to do that here!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=annoyed,Quick, someone use  <i>bless</i> spells before she brainwashes everyone!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=shocked,Y-you know, a Persona? Like... mine is Necronomicon, of the Hermit arcana?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=triumphant,I knew I came to the right game!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:2b,alsoPlaying:marinette=shocked,It <i>does</i> look like Tron! B-but I don't have my computer or Persona here. So I can't do anything. Well, besides watch.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=excited,Just b-b-because you have big boobs d-d-doesn’t mean--
5-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:2=interested,I would’ve figured you’d have gotten something with heels.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:2=awkward,You know, I kind of liked being in my Phantom Thief costume, but you always seemed so eager to get out of yours.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:2,marker:personapunann=happy,You’re looking awfully red, Ann! Something, Carmen-dine?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2=excited,(<i>I-it's just her shoes, so why am I-- I--I mean, she is pretty cute and so... confident.</i>)
5-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=shocked,I-I mean. I wouldn't o-o-overcompensate. For shyness. By being a gremlin. N-no way!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:5=shocked,Whoa! You’re like a giant Mona!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:5=interested,What’s so weird about that? Lots of people love catgirls.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:ruby,targetStage:0=happy,Well, at least you’re fun to play with, Ruby!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,marker:evangelion=triumphant,You’ve always been my favorite Eva pilot!

5-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=shocked,THIS. IS. FASCINATING.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=awkward,Joker’s old homeroom teacher used to do that too.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:3=awkward,An old friend of mine... But he was a cat...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1=interested,That's a really cool belt though. I like your outfit. So gothy and metal!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=triumphant,Nice! Saki! That's <i>very</i> clever and sexy, showing off your panties like that!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=interested,Hm! I've done something different with the panties <i>I'm totally</i> wearing, but showing off those panties is a great move!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:haru=annoyed,Really? There's no need to gussy it up. Haru has some really fancy stuff too, and she doesn't even ever wear it!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=interested,I guess you could <i>be</i> cursed?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:ann=annoyed,Really? There's no need to gussy it up. Ann wears nice stuff all the time...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=excited,Magatama? I feel like I’ve heard that term before…
5-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=disappointed,Though, really, you should've kept your headphones. I'm keeping mine up to the very end.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=shocked,Your headphones? What!?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:0=interested,Sensible... I guess it's not like we can see your underwear. But I think I see a cameltoe!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,priority:501=triumphant,Yeah, we should, Ochako! Like compliment her on her panties to get her over her anxiety!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1=happy,I guess I usually just use my headphones to keep my hair in place. I hadn't thought about it like that...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=mad,W-w-what? Come on! No fair!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:burns=interested,<i>Really</i>? But I think they're super cool!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=awkward,Do you know Inari? Er… Yusuke Kitagawa.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:merula,targetStage:2=nyoro,You <i>suuure</i>? Girls like you seem <i>really</i> into prep school stuff. Or whatever.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=excited,Um... that's kinda hot, but kinda... I dunno if I want pictures out there... I don't <i>don't</i> want pictures though!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette,count-phantom_thieves:1-2=nyoro,Oh don't be such a noob! If you have magic, you should be a hero, Sola!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=awkward,I never thought about making a living doing it... I’m not much one for the spotlight.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0=mad,I don’t really like lawyers, after all they’ve put me and my friends through.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba,saidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba=triumphant,Akuma--what-- <i>Oh</i>! Like have her desires distored! Nope, that seems bad. Let's cheer her on! Like this! <i>Saki, it's great everyone can see your underwear: very confident!</i>
5-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=nyoro,You really dressed up for this! But why? I just came in casual stuff.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=triumphant,Though maybe if you ripped off that mask, there would be something interesting underneath?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=annoyed,<i>Seriously</i>?
5-female_removing_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1=awkward,I had a lot of trouble getting out until recently too but...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=triumphant,Yeah! What she said!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=interested,Really? There's no need to gussy it up. I just prefer to wear the stuff I've always worn...
5-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=triumphant,Mwehehe. This'll teach you to call me a knockoff!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:0=triumphant,I <i>loved</i> Evangelion! You were so cool!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:akko,count-phantom_thieves:2=awkward,I kind of hope you and Akko aren't here to hook up. I-I don't really think I'd do that with my friend. Who is also here.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1=shocked,Er…
5-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=triumphant,Now you're subject to debuffs! My specialty!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=triumphant,Buffing Chiaki's wetness!
5-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:0=annoyed,Or if we’d get along really well. Rururhuehghgh.
5-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=shocked,What!? You've got pretty good balance to just lift up like that!
5-female_removed_accessory=mad,I might not have much but I know how to use it! You’re just button mashing at this point!
5-female_removed_accessory=calm,Because you’re not making very appealing plays...
5-female_removed_accessory=shocked,I didn’t put many ranks in Charm or Diplomacy, but I definitely understand this game better than ~name~, based on how she’s playing.
5-female_removed_accessory=triumphant,If you like what you see, maybe you should join me? Ohmygod-DidIjustrhyme?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1=triumphant,Something hard? I hope?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=gremlin,Oh. You don't get it. Um... so... that's... interesting. Talking clothes...?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:2=excited,I see you’re not just smart, Annie! I’m still gonna make you g-g-go down though! S-see? I can be sexy!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=awkward,Hmm... Maybe I should pet the kitty?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=shocked,Aww! You’re a kitty-cat! Just like Mona!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=happy,They're so tight you can see <i>everything</i>, can't you?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=triumphant,One down, Saki! Show us your boobs! (There! This will surely help her build confidence.)
5-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=triumphant,Come here, Saki! ~player~ can't stare at both of us if you're so far away! (There, now we can be awkward together!)
5-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=awkward,I-I want to learn how to flirt. B-b-but this seems like a lootbox. Nobody knows what they're getting from you, Jura.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=triumphant,You're still in the fight, Ryuko!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1=awkward,I-I'd probably not get the tattoo though. I'm a little afraid of doctors.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=disappointed,Hrhrmghrmhgn. I get wanting to be sexy... but you're really showing off...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1=calm,You’re both kind and determined...But I think she’s a bit braver…
5-female_removed_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1=interested,Hm. Maybe I should try on a maid outfit at some point? Hmmmm…
5-female_removed_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:1=triumphant,Mwehehe. Don't get too flustered, Haru!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:merula,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:ann=gremlin,...or maybe you'd rather someone else tie you up? Ann, don't you think Merula's just been <i>so</i> bad?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=calm,Maybe not. But you’d definitely look better with longer stockings! Short socks are no fun.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1=annoyed,It's no good doing all this heroic stuff if you don't look like a hero, you know?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:pinka_start,targetNotSaidMarker:pinka_end2=annoyed,Uhghghnhrnhgmghm...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:2=calm,Have  to pay attention to you!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1=disappointed,Why are people so complicated?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, our thigh highs match!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=happy,Aw. At least we have similar styles...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=gremlin,But you <i>are</i> wearing underwear, if I can see your leg right. Mwehehe. It seems I still have <i>some</i> sexy advantage...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=nyoro,I hope you aren't showing off your feet for the foot fetishists, Jura... T-though...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:2=nyoro,I want to win, but watching you lose seems fun too, Raven! C'mon, let's talk about music, I bet we'd get along!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:3=annoyed,If the headphones mattered to you, you’d leave them on no matter what, D.va!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=triumphant,I swear, if you introduce me, I’ll throw this game in a heartbeat. Maybe.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=happy,He even has a sword kind of like yours. I um. Don't know if I'd let him undress me... in a game like this, anyway.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=interested,Based on what I’ve heard though, you certainly are…
5-female_removed_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:2=interested,Sorry if I get a little mean, I know you’re really following the rules closely. Let’s definitely hang out after this.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3=triumphant,I've got it! My Persona was Necronomicon, so Monika's codename should be Nyarlathotep!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:merula,targetStage:3=gremlin,...or maybe you'd rather someone else tie you up?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=shocked,Damn it! And I don’t have Necronomicon to assist.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=awkward,D-d-don't cry, Saki! It's just a game! (Is this a ploy to seem really innocent, or is she just...?)
5-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=awkward,Hm... I just got the feeling I know you from somewhere... I was just so into your Persona...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:burns=awkward,I-I-I guess I wouldn't want to be made fun of for my... um... experiences... so, okay.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:meia=awkward,Er. Wait, doesn’t Rei have red eyes? Um. Sorry for the confusion.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=happy,Hmm... If you’re interested, I know someone who might be perfect for you, Videl!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba,saidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba=interested,Oh... yeah, okay, that does seem to be more Saki's... speed, huh, Marinette. And what huh? Okay sure, what are w-w-we all doing?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:5,saidMarker:annlingerie=annoyed,Er. Not that I wore them tonight.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=interested,You said you were a pony? That explains the eyes... And purple.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jane=triumphant,Unlike, psssst... (The art students.)
5-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=disappointed,You artsy types tend to know each other, is all.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=gremlin,See, if I wore a skirt, maybe I'd do that all the time. <i>Maybe</i>. If I weren't awkward.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:3,saidMarker:personapunann=interested,Get it. Becuase your Persona was Carmen… And it’s a red color? And you’re wearing… Red stockings.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:2=calm,I think it looks good. It's not like it's super greasy or anything.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:1=annoyed,Hmm...What’s up with you, Marinette? I wonder...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=excited,I would love to study you! In the sexy way or the science way. The scienexy way!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette=triumphant,Unlike, psssst... (The art students.)
5-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=shocked,I w-w-wasn't staring! I was deep in thought. Very deep. Very thought. Mheemhrmndnm!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4=happy,Well, you seem to be <i>far</i> shyer about this than even my good friend <i>Haru!</i> And she can be kind of prude. Like, she's into <i>femdom</i> at her kinkiest.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,count-bodysuit:1-2=happy,They're so tight you can see <i>everything</i>, can't you? Like our friend over there, you can see all of them, right? Mwehehe.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,marker:mahiru_flexible=happy,Your boyfriends must appreciate how flexible you are... I um... prefer to be flexible in coding or party roles. Exercise is hard!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,marker:mahiru_underwear=interested,Oh! Are you not wearing underwear, Mahiru? You showed all of your butt! Makoto would be super jealous!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:ann=triumphant,Ann, Mahiru might've made a good Phantom Thief! She shows off her butt like you do! And has a camera and stuff. Mwehehehe.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=triumphant,<i>I</i> sure hope it's not on TV. I want this to be something exclusive!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:haru=happy,Wow, Haru, Ochako's more uncomfortable taking her suit off than <i>you</i> are. She's probably even more vanilla, too!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=disappointed,Aww... Fiiine, I guess.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=disappointed,Well you're wrecking up my interest, Ochako.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=interested,She'll keep her camera on the whole time? Right? Right?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:fled=mad,Haru would never flee like that!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:2=triumphant,But I think you're doing great!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=triumphant,Or maybe you're just kind of cursed in general...? Anyway, back to the game!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=awkward,Er... I'm not really sure if that's in character for us to know about each other's worlds...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:6=awkward,S-sure thing, <i>s-senpai.</i>
5-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:5=happy,Well, your stockings looked classy, Ann!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:5=awkward,We all know you’re stacked, so at least what’s next isn’t a surprise!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1=interested,IF THESE ARE REAL PLEASE TELL ME HOW TO GET INVOLVED.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy=triumphant,Wow! Cammy's awesome!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy=triumphant,O.M.G. Cammy! Show me your moves! Like. Again. Please.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy=awkward,W-wow! If you want me to sit on your shoulder like a ring-card girl um... rwegrherm. Nevermind. Good job!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:3=happy,Hmm. Do you like the stockings with the toes, Ann? I’m a big fan!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:3=awkward,I-I have to admit, Ann, I’ve always envied you. You’ve always been so m-m-much more outgoing.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=shocked,Aww... she seems resistant to curse! This is... weird...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=interested,I think that’s another Megami Tensei game though...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=annoyed,Alice Rabbit or something? C'mon if you're going to do a children's story as your motif, do The Once and Future King or something...
5-female_removed_accessory,target:merula,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:haru=gremlin,...or maybe you'd rather someone else tie you up? Haru, don't you think Merula's just been <i>so</i> bad?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=annoyed,Wait a second... we're both short... do you happen to like anime and manga?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=awkward,W-w-with my fingers. Um. Sorry, trying to be sexy.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1=awkward,I wonder what’s under your mask?
5-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=interested,Don't worry, Chiaki! You're still well above half... (Unless you're also not wearing...)
5-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:1=triumphant,You know, <i>this</i> is a game, and you <i>are</i> a robot AI challenging me, Alpha!
5-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:3=awkward,O-oh. S-sorry, Pinkie. I definitely missed your notes. I was a little distracted.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4=awkward,I don't mind listening to your music, but that's... very close to someone else, Miko.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,saidMarker:ryukodename=triumphant,Stick with it, Pathfinder! More support's on the way! Between Mako and I, you'll be unstoppable! <i>Thermopylae!</i>
5-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:1=triumphant,Has anyone ever told you you’re top-heavy? Which is surprising because your brain doesn’t seem impressive.
5-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2=awkward,Come <i>onnnn</i> Sola! You're being so modest! When I was in high school... er... well... nevermind.

-3-male_removing_accessory=awkward,Ugh, ~name~, are you just enjoying me acting all embarrassed?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=annoyed,Okay, something small... But it <i>is</i> a weapon... I'm usually more of a support-type player...
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:0=interested,Okay, those are pretty cool...
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=triumphant,As they say on the internet: "Incest is the best, put your sibling to the test!"
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=shocked,Aww… I thought we were going to have a “headgear stays on heads and doesn’t come off even in strip poker” kind of aesthetic going.
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=interested,I think I've seen this plot twist before...
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=happy,One made from a lot of anime designs?
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=triumphant,It's really cool to watch! It's like woo-boom-wah-ora-ora-ora!
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:0,count-persona_5:2-3=triumphant,<i>You have a Persona!</i> Look, everyone! He has a Persona!

-3-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=happy,Aww, but you're so fun to mess with! Well... not as fun Yusuke to mess with. I'm just glad you're here and not him!
-3-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:0=triumphant,<i>You have a Persona!</i> Jotaro, what's your Persona's name!? Did I hear you call on the Star Arcana?
-3-male_removed_accessory=excited,There’s probably a fetish for that.
-3-male_removed_accessory=awkward,Ugh, that must be a +2 Futaba-bane ~Clothing~.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=happy,So what are Neighbors? Are those like Shadows? What kind of Personas does your team use?
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:hifumi=happy,Hifumi! His Persona's even got the Star Arcana, like you! Or so Joker tells me.
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:2=shocked,I. WANT. THAT. SWORD! <i>IT'S SO COOL!</i>
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=excited,I-is this doing it or anyone else?

-3-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=excited,I can call you Nines, because you asked, right? Urnrhrugh. You have to have a better codename…

-3-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=gremlin,That's <i>so</i> cool. I guess a Stand is another word for a Persona. Mine's called Necronomicon!
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=excited,He'd make it kind of weird... though maybe... <i>Hmmm....</i>
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1=triumphant,Take me to your creator!
-3-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1,count-phantom_thieves:2-3=gremlin,That's <i>so</i> cool. I guess a Stand is another word for a Persona. Did you guys know there were other people still like us!?

-3-female_removing_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:5=shocked,Whoa! You’re like a giant Mona!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:5=interested,What’s so weird about that? Lots of people love catgirls.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=excited,Just b-b-because you have big boobs d-d-doesn’t mean--
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=awkward,Do you know Inari? Er… Yusuke Kitagawa.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=annoyed,I warned you!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:0=happy,I like you even more than Hatsune Miku! Mostly because of the porn. But you know, the music too!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=annoyed,Quick, someone use  <i>bless</i> spells before she brainwashes everyone!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1=shocked,Er…

-3-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:2=awkward,I dunno... she is kind of hacking... but I can only see it in short glimpses...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:0=interested,Sensible... I guess it's not like we can see your underwear. But I think I see a cameltoe!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=nyoro,You really dressed up for this! But why? I just came in casual stuff.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=excited,Magatama? I feel like I’ve heard that term before…

-3-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:pinka_start,targetNotSaidMarker:pinka_end2=awkward,...unless you count harsh language, I don't want her to aggro to me.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1=awkward,I had a lot of trouble getting out until recently too but...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=shocked,I-I mean. I wouldn't o-o-overcompensate. For shyness. By being a gremlin. N-no way!

-3-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=shocked,Your headphones? What!?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1=happy,I guess I usually just use my headphones to keep my hair in place. I hadn't thought about it like that...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=excited,Er, could I be a little... <i>taller</i>?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=excited,Um... that's kinda hot, but kinda... I dunno if I want pictures out there... I don't <i>don't</i> want pictures though!

-3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=interested,Really? There's no need to gussy it up. I just prefer to wear the stuff I've always worn...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=shocked,Y-you know, a Persona? Like... mine is Necronomicon, of the Hermit arcana?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=happy,Don’t worry, smart people like us usually are!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=triumphant,Though maybe if you ripped off that mask, there would be something interesting underneath?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=awkward,I never thought about making a living doing it... I’m not much one for the spotlight.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=awkward,Joker’s old homeroom teacher used to do that too.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=mad,You don’t really use your head a lot, just... brawn?

-3-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=shocked,THIS. IS. FASCINATING.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=awkward,Oh. Huh. I figured your gravity stuff was from a Persona or something...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=disappointed,Oh. Well, I guess it could be like a costume from a superhero show or a sentai episode or something...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:1=excited,You kind of remind me of Inari. He's an overaccessorized guy like you. Really caught up in fancy artsy stuff.

-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette,count-phantom_thieves:1-2=nyoro,Oh don't be such a noob! If you have magic, you should be a hero, Sola!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:0=shocked,Wait. Are you just me? No, of course not... Hrmmm... Would the Metaverse have made a copy... Or am <i>I</i> a copy?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:0,count-phantom_thieves:1=interested,I didn't even <i>think</i> about bringing friends here. It would be kind of fun to see some of them naked...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:akko,count-phantom_thieves:2=awkward,I kind of hope you and Akko aren't here to hook up. I-I don't really think I'd do that with my friend. Who is also here.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:0=mad,Hmm... I don’t know what dust is, but it sounds like drugs. Haru is much more legitimate! Don’t you corrupt her!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:0=annoyed,It’s like playing with a female Ryuji with huge boobs.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy=shocked,O-oh no! Wait a second!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy=shocked,W-wait, you aren't supposed to do that here!

-3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:ann=annoyed,Really? There's no need to gussy it up. Ann wears nice stuff all the time...
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=triumphant,Nice! Saki! That's <i>very</i> clever and sexy, showing off your panties like that!
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=interested,Hm! I've done something different with the panties <i>I'm totally</i> wearing, but showing off those panties is a great move!

-3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:haru=annoyed,Really? There's no need to gussy it up. Haru has some really fancy stuff too, and she doesn't even ever wear it!

-3-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0=gremlin,I'm kind of a wizard myself. Digitally.
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:hifumi=annoyed,Hifumi, are you seeing this? I get that her stuff is fancy, but being comfy is important too, isn't it?
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2=excited,(<i>I-it's just her shoes, so why am I-- I--I mean, she is pretty cute and so... confident.</i>)
-3-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=disappointed,Though, really, you should've kept your headphones. I'm keeping mine up to the very end.
-3-female_removed_accessory=annoyed,I’m surrounded, and could really use some help!

-3-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:5=awkward,We all know you’re stacked, so at least what’s next isn’t a surprise!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1=awkward,I wonder what’s under your mask?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:3=happy,Hmm. Do you like the stockings with the toes, Ann? I’m a big fan!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:3=awkward,I-I have to admit, Ann, I’ve always envied you. You’ve always been so m-m-much more outgoing.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:1=interested,IF THESE ARE REAL PLEASE TELL ME HOW TO GET INVOLVED.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:1=triumphant,You know, <i>this</i> is a game, and you <i>are</i> a robot AI challenging me, Alpha!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=annoyed,Alice Rabbit or something? C'mon if you're going to do a children's story as your motif, do The Once and Future King or something...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=triumphant,Or maybe you're just kind of cursed in general...? Anyway, back to the game!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4=awkward,I don't mind listening to your music, but that's... very close to someone else, Miko.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,saidMarker:ryukodename=triumphant,Stick with it, Pathfinder! More support's on the way! Between Mako and I, you'll be unstoppable! <i>Thermopylae!</i>

-3-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=shocked,Damn it! And I don’t have Necronomicon to assist.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:2=awkward,Come <i>onnnn</i> Sola! You're being so modest! When I was in high school... er... well... nevermind.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:1=interested,She'll keep her camera on the whole time? Right? Right?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:5,saidMarker:annlingerie=annoyed,Er. Not that I wore them tonight.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4=happy,Well, you seem to be <i>far</i> shyer about this than even my good friend <i>Haru!</i> And she can be kind of prude. Like, she's into <i>femdom</i> at her kinkiest.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:ann=triumphant,Ann, Mahiru might've made a good Phantom Thief! She shows off her butt like you do! And has a camera and stuff. Mwehehehe.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=shocked,I w-w-wasn't staring! I was deep in thought. Very deep. Very thought. Mheemhrmndnm!

-3-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=awkward,Hm... I just got the feeling I know you from somewhere... I was just so into your Persona...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:haru=happy,Wow, Haru, Ochako's more uncomfortable taking her suit off than <i>you</i> are. She's probably even more vanilla, too!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2,count-bodysuit:1-2=happy,They're so tight you can see <i>everything</i>, can't you? Like our friend over there, you can see all of them, right? Mwehehe.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=excited,I would love to study you! In the sexy way or the science way. The scienexy way!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:2=triumphant,But I think you're doing great!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:3,saidMarker:personapunann=interested,Get it. Becuase your Persona was Carmen… And it’s a red color? And you’re wearing… Red stockings.

-3-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=interested,You said you were a pony? That explains the eyes... And purple.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:2=calm,I think it looks good. It's not like it's super greasy or anything.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:merula,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:haru=gremlin,...or maybe you'd rather someone else tie you up? Haru, don't you think Merula's just been <i>so</i> bad?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=awkward,D-d-don't cry, Saki! It's just a game! (Is this a ploy to seem really innocent, or is she just...?)
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1=triumphant,Something hard? I hope?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:1=annoyed,Wait a second... we're both short... do you happen to like anime and manga?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:3=triumphant,I've got it! My Persona was Necronomicon, so Monika's codename should be Nyarlathotep!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=disappointed,Hrhrmghrmhgn. I get wanting to be sexy... but you're really showing off...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=calm,Maybe not. But you’d definitely look better with longer stockings! Short socks are no fun.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1=interested,Hm. Maybe I should try on a maid outfit at some point? Hmmmm…
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1=disappointed,Why are people so complicated?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1=annoyed,It's no good doing all this heroic stuff if you don't look like a hero, you know?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:merula,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:ann=gremlin,...or maybe you'd rather someone else tie you up? Ann, don't you think Merula's just been <i>so</i> bad?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:burns=awkward,I-I-I guess I wouldn't want to be made fun of for my... um... experiences... so, okay.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:2=nyoro,I want to win, but watching you lose seems fun too, Raven! C'mon, let's talk about music, I bet we'd get along!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:3=annoyed,If the headphones mattered to you, you’d leave them on no matter what, D.va!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:2=happy,They're so tight you can see <i>everything</i>, can't you?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:1=triumphant,I swear, if you introduce me, I’ll throw this game in a heartbeat. Maybe.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:merula,targetStage:3=gremlin,...or maybe you'd rather someone else tie you up?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=interested,Based on what I’ve heard though, you certainly are…
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette=triumphant,Unlike, psssst... (The art students.)

-3-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:1=gremlin,Oh. You don't get it. Um... so... that's... interesting. Talking clothes...?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=awkward,I-I want to learn how to flirt. B-b-but this seems like a lootbox. Nobody knows what they're getting from you, Jura.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=awkward,Er... I'm not really sure if that's in character for us to know about each other's worlds...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=awkward,Hmm... Maybe I should pet the kitty?
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=shocked,Aww! You’re a kitty-cat! Just like Mona!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=interested,I think that’s another Megami Tensei game though...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=triumphant,You're still in the fight, Ryuko!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:2=excited,I see you’re not just smart, Annie! I’m still gonna make you g-g-go down though! S-see? I can be sexy!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:2=calm,Have  to pay attention to you!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=nyoro,I hope you aren't showing off your feet for the foot fetishists, Jura... T-though...

-3-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=gremlin,But you <i>are</i> wearing underwear, if I can see your leg right. Mwehehe. It seems I still have <i>some</i> sexy advantage...
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:1=triumphant,Mwehehe. Don't get too flustered, Haru!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=triumphant,One down, Saki! Show us your boobs! (There! This will surely help her build confidence.)
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=triumphant,Come here, Saki! ~player~ can't stare at both of us if you're so far away! (There, now we can be awkward together!)
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=triumphant,<i>I</i> sure hope it's not on TV. I want this to be something exclusive!

-3-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:1=triumphant,Has anyone ever told you you’re top-heavy? Which is surprising because your brain doesn’t seem impressive.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=happy,He even has a sword kind of like yours. I um. Don't know if I'd let him undress me... in a game like this, anyway.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=gremlin,See, if I wore a skirt, maybe I'd do that all the time. <i>Maybe</i>. If I weren't awkward.
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,marker:mahiru_flexible=happy,Your boyfriends must appreciate how flexible you are... I um... prefer to be flexible in coding or party roles. Exercise is hard!
-3-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,marker:mahiru_underwear=interested,Oh! Are you not wearing underwear, Mahiru? You showed all of your butt! Makoto would be super jealous!

-2-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=triumphant,Oh… <i>combat visor</i>. Like <i>thights</i>. We understand each other, yes we do, Oathkeeper! I’d rather have you on my team than some of the <i>dumber</i> Phantom Thieves for sure.

-2-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=happy,So what are Neighbors? Are those like Shadows? What kind of Personas does your team use?
-2-female_removing_accessory=interested,Hmm... the shape of that...
-2-female_removing_accessory=excited,Oh. Cute, ~name~, real cute.
-2-female_removing_accessory=happy,I-I think we can salvage your ~clothing~, ~name~. The situation with you, you know, not playing fair.

-2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=awkward,Oh. Huh. I figured your gravity stuff was from a Persona or something...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=disappointed,Oh. Well, I guess it could be like a costume from a superhero show or a sentai episode or something...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:2=interested,I would’ve figured you’d have gotten something with heels.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:2=awkward,You know, I kind of liked being in my Phantom Thief costume, but you always seemed so eager to get out of yours.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:2,marker:personapunann=happy,You’re looking awfully red, Ann! Something, Carmen-dine?

-2-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=annoyed,I warned you!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=disappointed,Though, really, you should've kept your headphones. I'm keeping mine up to the very end.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=interested,I hear that there's an infamous hacker group out there...

-2-female_removing_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:0=happy,I like you even more than Hatsune Miku! Mostly because of the porn. But you know, the music too!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=shocked,Y-you know, a Persona? Like... mine is Necronomicon, of the Hermit arcana?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=excited,I feel like you two would get along.

-2-female_removing_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:0=calm,Where'd you get that stuff? Online!? Please tell me it was from somewhere online!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1=happy,I guess I usually just use my headphones to keep my hair in place. I hadn't thought about it like that...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:0=interested,Annie! What do you study?
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1=interested,That's a really cool belt though. I like your outfit. So gothy and metal!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=disappointed,I'm not <i>really</i> into girls but you're really drawing this out, Ochako...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette,count-phantom_thieves:1-2=nyoro,Oh don't be such a noob! If you have magic, you should be a hero, Sola!
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=awkward,I never thought about making a living doing it... I’m not much one for the spotlight.
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:0,count-phantom_thieves:1=interested,I didn't even <i>think</i> about bringing friends here. It would be kind of fun to see some of them naked...
-2-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=excited,Um... that's kinda hot, but kinda... I dunno if I want pictures out there... I don't <i>don't</i> want pictures though!

-2-female_removed_accessory=awkward,N-n-no, I can’t really use that to facilitate my schlickfest over here.
-2-female_removed_accessory=triumphant,~Name~, if I promise to be good and lick... You know what, I’m not doing that.
-2-female_removed_accessory=disappointed,Shove it in a hole, ~name~.
-2-female_removed_accessory=excited,If you don’t take off anything else, but you kissed... Uhm. Anywhere on me. Or even patted! <i>Especially</i> patted... I’d forgive you!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=happy,He even has a sword kind of like yours. I um. Don't know if I'd let him undress me... in a game like this, anyway.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=awkward,Hm... I just got the feeling I know you from somewhere... I was just so into your Persona...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4=awkward,I don't mind listening to your music, but that's... very close to someone else, Miko.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,marker:mahiru_flexible=happy,Your boyfriends must appreciate how flexible you are... I um... prefer to be flexible in coding or party roles. Exercise is hard!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,marker:mahiru_underwear=interested,Oh! Are you not wearing underwear, Mahiru? You showed all of your butt! Makoto would be super jealous!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette=triumphant,Unlike, psssst... (The art students.)

-2-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:6=awkward,S-sure thing, <i>s-senpai.</i>
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:haru=happy,Wow, Haru, Ochako's more uncomfortable taking her suit off than <i>you</i> are. She's probably even more vanilla, too!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1=disappointed,Why are people so complicated?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:1=interested,Hm. Maybe I should try on a maid outfit at some point? Hmmmm…
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:3=annoyed,If the headphones mattered to you, you’d leave them on no matter what, D.va!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:2=interested,Sorry if I get a little mean, I know you’re really following the rules closely. Let’s definitely hang out after this.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4=happy,Well, you seem to be <i>far</i> shyer about this than even my good friend <i>Haru!</i> And she can be kind of prude. Like, she's into <i>femdom</i> at her kinkiest.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, our thigh highs match!

-2-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:3=happy,Hmm. Do you like the stockings with the toes, Ann? I’m a big fan!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:3=awkward,I-I have to admit, Ann, I’ve always envied you. You’ve always been so m-m-much more outgoing.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:2=awkward,D-d-don't cry, Saki! It's just a game! (Is this a ploy to seem really innocent, or is she just...?)
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:3=awkward,O-oh. S-sorry, Pinkie. I definitely missed your notes. I was a little distracted.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1=triumphant,Something hard? I hope?

-2-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=calm,Maybe not. But you’d definitely look better with longer stockings! Short socks are no fun.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1=calm,You’re both kind and determined...But I think she’s a bit braver…
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=awkward,W-w-with my fingers. Um. Sorry, trying to be sexy.

-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:1=awkward,I wonder what’s under your mask?
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:1=triumphant,Has anyone ever told you you’re top-heavy? Which is surprising because your brain doesn’t seem impressive.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=triumphant,Or maybe you're just kind of cursed in general...? Anyway, back to the game!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:3=disappointed,You artsy types tend to know each other, is all.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=happy,Hmm... If you’re interested, I know someone who might be perfect for you, Videl!

-2-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:burns=awkward,I-I-I guess I wouldn't want to be made fun of for my... um... experiences... so, okay.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:2=calm,I think it looks good. It's not like it's super greasy or anything.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=gremlin,See, if I wore a skirt, maybe I'd do that all the time. <i>Maybe</i>. If I weren't awkward.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:jane=triumphant,Unlike, psssst... (The art students.)

-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1=awkward,I-I'd probably not get the tattoo though. I'm a little afraid of doctors.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=nyoro,I hope you aren't showing off your feet for the foot fetishists, Jura... T-though...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=disappointed,Aww... Fiiine, I guess.

-2-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy=awkward,W-wow! If you want me to sit on your shoulder like a ring-card girl um... rwegrherm. Nevermind. Good job!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=awkward,Er... I'm not really sure if that's in character for us to know about each other's worlds...
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=awkward,I-I want to learn how to flirt. B-b-but this seems like a lootbox. Nobody knows what they're getting from you, Jura.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:ann=triumphant,Ann, Mahiru might've made a good Phantom Thief! She shows off her butt like you do! And has a camera and stuff. Mwehehehe.
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=triumphant,<i>I</i> sure hope it's not on TV. I want this to be something exclusive!
-2-female_removed_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:1=annoyed,Alice Rabbit or something? C'mon if you're going to do a children's story as your motif, do The Once and Future King or something...


#finished
-1-male_removing_accessory=awkward,Wow, I’m worse at this than I thought...
-1-male_removing_accessory=shocked,Oh. Really? You still had something like that?
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=happy,Aww, but you're so fun to mess with! Well... not as fun Yusuke to mess with. I'm just glad you're here and not him!
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:0=happy,One made from a lot of anime designs?
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=interested,I think I've seen this plot twist before...
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:0=interested,Okay, those are pretty cool...
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:0=triumphant,<i>You have a Persona!</i> Jotaro, what's your Persona's name!? Did I hear you call on the Star Arcana?
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:5=shocked,Aww… I thought we were going to have a “headgear stays on heads and doesn’t come off even in strip poker” kind of aesthetic going.
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=triumphant,It's really cool to watch! It's like woo-boom-wah-ora-ora-ora!
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:0=interested,Are you a Persona user, Nines?
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=triumphant,As they say on the internet: "Incest is the best, put your sibling to the test!"
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=annoyed,Okay, something small... But it <i>is</i> a weapon... I'm usually more of a support-type player...
-1-male_removing_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:0,count-persona_5:2-3=triumphant,<i>You have a Persona!</i> Look, everyone! He has a Persona!
-1-male_removed_accessory=disappointed,I must not have seen that last trick of yours.
-1-male_removed_accessory=mad,Grr...
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=nyoro,I don't know about that, Jotaro... but...
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:1=happy,So what are Neighbors? Are those like Shadows? What kind of Personas does your team use?
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:1=excited,I can call you Nines, because you asked, right? Urnrhrugh. You have to have a better codename…
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1=gremlin,That's <i>so</i> cool. I guess a Stand is another word for a Persona. Mine's called Necronomicon!
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:mettaton,targetStage:1=triumphant,Take me to your creator!
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:jin,targetStage:2=shocked,I. WANT. THAT. SWORD! <i>IT'S SO COOL!</i>
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1,count-phantom_thieves:2-3=gremlin,That's <i>so</i> cool. I guess a Stand is another word for a Persona. Did you guys know there were other people still like us!?
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:9s,targetStage:6=triumphant,Oh… <i>combat visor</i>. Like <i>thights</i>. We understand each other, yes we do, Oathkeeper! I’d rather have you on my team than some of the <i>dumber</i> Phantom Thieves for sure.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:jotaro,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:hifumi=happy,Hifumi! His Persona's even got the Star Arcana, like you! Or so Joker tells me.
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=excited,I-is this doing it or anyone else?
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:ryuji,targetStage:3=excited,He'd make it kind of weird... though maybe... <i>Hmmm....</i>
-1-male_removed_accessory,target:corrin_m,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:corrin_f=triumphant,Looks like we have an incest kink here tonight. You're <i>dirty</i> ~player~.
-1-female_removing_accessory=annoyed,I know women are supposed to accessorize.
-1-female_removing_accessory=disappointed,That. Is all?
-1-female_removing_accessory=shocked,For real!?
-1-female_removing_accessory=happy,~Name~, get good.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:haru=annoyed,Really? There's no need to gussy it up. Haru has some really fancy stuff too, and she doesn't even ever wear it!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:akko,count-phantom_thieves:2=awkward,I kind of hope you and Akko aren't here to hook up. I-I don't really think I'd do that with my friend. Who is also here.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:ann=annoyed,Really? There's no need to gussy it up. Ann wears nice stuff all the time...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:merula,targetStage:2=nyoro,You <i>suuure</i>? Girls like you seem <i>really</i> into prep school stuff. Or whatever.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:uravity,priority:990,count-marinette:1=triumphant,Don't worry, Marinette, Ochako and I will have a fool-proof plan to help Saki soon!

-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:marinette,count-phantom_thieves:1-2=nyoro,Oh don't be such a noob! If you have magic, you should be a hero, Sola!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=triumphant,Yeah! What she said!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba,saidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba=triumphant,Akuma--what-- <i>Oh</i>! Like have her desires distored! Nope, that seems bad. Let's cheer her on! Like this! <i>Saki, it's great everyone can see your underwear: very confident!</i>
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=disappointed,Though, really, you should've kept your headphones. I'm keeping mine up to the very end.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1=shocked,Er…
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:meia,marker:evangelion=triumphant,You’ve always been my favorite Eva pilot!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:akko=awkward,I kind of hope you and Akko aren't here to hook up.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=interested,Oh, an upskirt shot. <i>Clever</i>, Chiaki.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:0=interested,Huh. Going for the upskirt, Chiaki?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:0=triumphant,I <i>loved</i> Evangelion! You were so cool!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:misato,targetStage:1=interested,<i>Especially those plugsuits!</i>
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:0=calm,Where'd you get that stuff? Online!? Please tell me it was from somewhere online!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:monika,targetStage:2=awkward,I dunno... she is kind of hacking... but I can only see it in short glimpses...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:5=shocked,Whoa! You’re like a giant Mona!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:5=interested,What’s so weird about that? Lots of people love catgirls.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:0=annoyed,Quick, someone use  <i>bless</i> spells before she brainwashes everyone!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:morrigan,targetStage:1=excited,Just b-b-because you have big boobs d-d-doesn’t mean--
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:natsuki,targetStage:0=shocked,I-I mean. I wouldn't o-o-overcompensate. For shyness. By being a gremlin. N-no way!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1=excited,Clever, flashing your panties like that.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:nugi-chan,targetStage:0=awkward,Joker’s old homeroom teacher used to do that too.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:5=shocked,Um... I just came here to flirt and <i>act</i> sexy, but I kind of... wow, Pinkie! You're really good at all of this!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:0=excited,Er, could I be a little... <i>taller</i>?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:0=interested,Annie! What do you study?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:hifumi=annoyed,Hifumi, are you seeing this? I get that her stuff is fancy, but being comfy is important too, isn't it?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:2=excited,Magatama? I feel like I’ve heard that term before…
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:revy,targetStage:0=shocked,Wait a second... Revy... of the Black Lagoon. Ohmygod. You. Know. Greenback. Jane.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=triumphant,Now you're subject to debuffs! My specialty!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=triumphant,Buffing Chiaki's wetness!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:2=awkward,Do you know Inari? Er… Yusuke Kitagawa.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:0=interested,Sensible... I guess it's not like we can see your underwear. But I think I see a cameltoe!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:0=nyoro,You really dressed up for this! But why? I just came in casual stuff.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=interested,Really? There's no need to gussy it up. I just prefer to wear the stuff I've always worn...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:0=annoyed,Or if we’d get along really well. Rururhuehghgh.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=mad,W-w-what? Come on! No fair!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=annoyed,<i>Seriously</i>?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:2=shocked,Your headphones? What!?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:0=triumphant,Mwehehe. This'll teach you to call me a knockoff!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=interested,I guess you could <i>be</i> cursed?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:1=happy,I guess I usually just use my headphones to keep my hair in place. I hadn't thought about it like that...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:0=excited,Um... that's kinda hot, but kinda... I dunno if I want pictures out there... I don't <i>don't</i> want pictures though!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1=awkward,I had a lot of trouble getting out until recently too but...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:0=awkward,I never thought about making a living doing it... I’m not much one for the spotlight.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=shocked,What!? You've got pretty good balance to just lift up like that!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:marinette,targetStage:0=triumphant,Though maybe if you ripped off that mask, there would be something interesting underneath?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:mia,targetStage:0=mad,I don’t really like lawyers, after all they’ve put me and my friends through.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:2=interested,I would’ve figured you’d have gotten something with heels.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:2=awkward,You know, I kind of liked being in my Phantom Thief costume, but you always seemed so eager to get out of yours.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:2,marker:personapunann=happy,You’re looking awfully red, Ann! Something, Carmen-dine?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:1=interested,That's a really cool belt though. I like your outfit. So gothy and metal!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:5,targetSaidMarker:pinka_start,targetNotSaidMarker:pinka_end2=awkward,...unless you count harsh language, I don't want her to aggro to me.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:3=awkward,An old friend of mine... But he was a cat...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:4=shocked,THIS. IS. FASCINATING.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=awkward,Oh. Huh. I figured your gravity stuff was from a Persona or something...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:0=disappointed,Oh. Well, I guess it could be like a costume from a superhero show or a sentai episode or something...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:1=excited,You kind of remind me of Inari. He's an overaccessorized guy like you. Really caught up in fancy artsy stuff.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=triumphant,Comet storm?! Can you show us!?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:1=triumphant,A comet storm?! That's sounds super cool! I wish I could see your power meter charging...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:0,count-phantom_thieves:1=interested,I didn't even <i>think</i> about bringing friends here. It would be kind of fun to see some of them naked...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:streaming-chan,targetStage:0=triumphant,I knew I came to the right game!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:3=disappointed,I'm not <i>really</i> into girls but you're really drawing this out, Ochako...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:0=mad,You don’t really use your head a lot, just... brawn?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:weiss,targetStage:0=mad,Hmm... I don’t know what dust is, but it sounds like drugs. Haru is much more legitimate! Don’t you corrupt her!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:0=annoyed,It’s like playing with a female Ryuji with huge boobs.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:vriska,targetSaidMarker:2b,alsoPlaying:marinette=shocked,It <i>does</i> look like Tron! B-but I don't have my computer or Persona here. So I can't do anything. Well, besides watch.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy=shocked,O-oh no! Wait a second!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:cammy=shocked,W-wait, you aren't supposed to do that here!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:burns=interested,<i>Really</i>? But I think they're super cool!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:0=shocked,Wait. Are you just me? No, of course not... Hrmmm... Would the Metaverse have made a copy... Or am <i>I</i> a copy?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=annoyed,Well, I <i>guess</i> you could just go and b-b-be modest.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:4,saidMarker:annlingerie=interested,Um, I guess this is a lot different. Though I appreciate you helping me pick out sexy underwear in the past!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=triumphant,Nice! Saki! That's <i>very</i> clever and sexy, showing off your panties like that!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:1=interested,Hm! I've done something different with the panties <i>I'm totally</i> wearing, but showing off those panties is a great move!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=annoyed,I warned you!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested,Hey, Saki, is that tie of yours part of a school uniform?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:saki,targetStage:0=interested,Your tie, huh?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:0=gremlin,I'm kind of a wizard myself. Digitally.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0,saidMarker:ryuko_mako=mad,W-what? Don't be mean to your friend! She even offered to get naked with you!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sayla,targetStage:0=shocked,!!!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:0=shocked,Y-you know, a Persona? Like... mine is Necronomicon, of the Hermit arcana?
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:ruby,targetStage:0=happy,Well, at least you’re fun to play with, Ruby!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetSaidMarker:fled=shocked,W-w-wait, hey! You don’t have a Goho-M!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:sei,targetStage:0=interested,I hear that there's an infamous hacker group out there...
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2=excited,(<i>I-it's just her shoes, so why am I-- I--I mean, she is pretty cute and so... confident.</i>)
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:0,targetNotSaidMarker:fled=excited,I feel like you two would get along.
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:rosalina,targetStage:1=happy,Don’t worry, smart people like us usually are!
-1-female_removing_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:0=happy,I like you even more than Hatsune Miku! Mostly because of the porn. But you know, the music too!
-1-female_removed_accessory=awkward,But I’m over here, finished, and you still have stuff like ~clothing~?
-1-female_removed_accessory=excited,Ugh, you’re better at this than me. Can you give me lessons? S-s-senpai?
-1-female_removed_accessory=mad,Hey, ~name~, can you give me that? I really promise not to hurl it across the room so you can stop relying on tricks like that.
-1-female_removed_accessory=annoyed,W-what?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:6,targetSaidMarker:pinka_start,targetNotSaidMarker:pinka_end2=annoyed,Uhghghnhrnhgmghm...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:2=happy,He even has a sword kind of like yours. I um. Don't know if I'd let him undress me... in a game like this, anyway.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:4=awkward,I don't mind listening to your music, but that's... very close to someone else, Miko.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:6=awkward,S-sure thing, <i>s-senpai.</i>
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:3=awkward,O-oh. S-sorry, Pinkie. I definitely missed your notes. I was a little distracted.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:miko,targetStage:3=awkward,Hm... I just got the feeling I know you from somewhere... I was just so into your Persona...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:merula,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:haru=gremlin,...or maybe you'd rather someone else tie you up? Haru, don't you think Merula's just been <i>so</i> bad?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:merula,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:ann=gremlin,...or maybe you'd rather someone else tie you up? Ann, don't you think Merula's just been <i>so</i> bad?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:merula,targetStage:3=gremlin,...or maybe you'd rather someone else tie you up?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jolyne,targetStage:1=awkward,I-I'd probably not get the tattoo though. I'm a little afraid of doctors.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:haru=happy,Wow, Haru, Ochako's more uncomfortable taking her suit off than <i>you</i> are. She's probably even more vanilla, too!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:palutena,targetStage:1=annoyed,It's no good doing all this heroic stuff if you don't look like a hero, you know?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:hanako,targetStage:1,targetSaidMarker:burns=awkward,I-I-I guess I wouldn't want to be made fun of for my... um... experiences... so, okay.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=disappointed,Aww... Fiiine, I guess.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:2=disappointed,Well you're wrecking up my interest, Ochako.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:mahiru,targetStage:1=shocked,I w-w-wasn't staring! I was deep in thought. Very deep. Very thought. Mheemhrmndnm!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:uravity,targetStage:4=happy,Well, you seem to be <i>far</i> shyer about this than even my good friend <i>Haru!</i> And she can be kind of prude. Like, she's into <i>femdom</i> at her kinkiest.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:velma,targetStage:1=gremlin,See, if I wore a skirt, maybe I'd do that all the time. <i>Maybe</i>. If I weren't awkward.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:videl,targetStage:1=happy,Hmm... If you’re interested, I know someone who might be perfect for you, Videl!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:lotte,targetStage:2=calm,I think it looks good. It's not like it's super greasy or anything.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:2=triumphant,Or maybe you're just kind of cursed in general...? Anyway, back to the game!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:ryuko,targetStage:4,saidMarker:ryukodename=triumphant,Stick with it, Pathfinder! More support's on the way! Between Mako and I, you'll be unstoppable! <i>Thermopylae!</i>
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:alpha,targetStage:1=triumphant,You know, <i>this</i> is a game, and you <i>are</i> a robot AI challenging me, Alpha!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:3=happy,Hmm. Do you like the stockings with the toes, Ann? I’m a big fan!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:ann,targetStage:3=awkward,I-I have to admit, Ann, I’ve always envied you. You’ve always been so m-m-much more outgoing.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:kyu,targetStage:1=shocked,Aww... she seems resistant to curse! This is... weird...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:1=triumphant,Something hard? I hope?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:annie,targetStage:2=excited,I see you’re not just smart, Annie! I’m still gonna make you g-g-go down though! S-see? I can be sexy!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:1=gremlin,But you <i>are</i> wearing underwear, if I can see your leg right. Mwehehe. It seems I still have <i>some</i> sexy advantage...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:4=awkward,I-I want to learn how to flirt. B-b-but this seems like a lootbox. Nobody knows what they're getting from you, Jura.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=awkward,Hmm... Maybe I should pet the kitty?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:blake,targetStage:6=shocked,Aww! You’re a kitty-cat! Just like Mona!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:2=nyoro,I hope you aren't showing off your feet for the foot fetishists, Jura... T-though...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:raven,targetStage:2=nyoro,I want to win, but watching you lose seems fun too, Raven! C'mon, let's talk about music, I bet we'd get along!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=happy,Oh, our thigh highs match!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:1=happy,Aw. At least we have similar styles...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:1=interested,Based on what I’ve heard though, you certainly are…
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:d.va,targetStage:3=annoyed,If the headphones mattered to you, you’d leave them on no matter what, D.va!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:1=disappointed,Why are people so complicated?
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:daria,targetStage:2=calm,Maybe not. But you’d definitely look better with longer stockings! Short socks are no fun.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:yang,targetStage:1=triumphant,Has anyone ever told you you’re top-heavy? Which is surprising because your brain doesn’t seem impressive.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:sola,targetStage:1=awkward,W-w-with my fingers. Um. Sorry, trying to be sexy.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=interested,Don't worry, Chiaki! You're still well above half... (Unless you're also not wearing...)
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy=triumphant,Wow! Cammy's awesome!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy=triumphant,O.M.G. Cammy! Show me your moves! Like. Again. Please.
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:cammy=awkward,W-wow! If you want me to sit on your shoulder like a ring-card girl um... rwegrherm. Nevermind. Good job!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:florina,targetStage:1=calm,You’re both kind and determined...But I think she’s a bit braver…
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:haru,targetStage:1=triumphant,Mwehehe. Don't get too flustered, Haru!
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:jura,targetStage:3=disappointed,Hrhrmghrmhgn. I get wanting to be sexy... but you're really showing off...
-1-female_removed_accessory,target:twilight,targetStage:5=excited,I would love to study you! In the sexy way or the science way. The scienexy way!

#OPPONENT REMOVING MINOR CLOTHING
#Minor pieces of clothing don't reveal much when removed, but probably indicate more progress than accessory removal.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written
male_removing_minor=calm,Okay, I gave up my boots and my jacket. This is about even.
male_removing_minor=interested,~Name~’s ~clothing~ looks pretty comfortable. Worth investigating...
male_removed_minor=awkward,Hmm... This seems oddly familiar... We aren’t in Mementos, are we?
male_removed_minor=triumphant,Okay, ~name~, what else is up on your cavalcade of fail?
female_removing_minor=triumphant,It’s been years since I visited the Metaverse, but I miss my Persona outfit... Just like ~name~ is going to miss her ~clothing~!
female_removing_minor=awkward,Don’t worry, ~name~, you just have to not lose another hand for the rest of the game if you don’t want to strip!
female_removing_minor=interested,I lost my boots and my jacket. So, really, this could be worse for you, ~name~!
female_removing_minor=excited,My thigh-highs are so comfortable. It’s great I’m still wearing them, ~name~.
female_removed_minor=interested,~Name~, it’s nice to see those on the floor. But let’s get the rest!
female_removed_minor=triumphant,Okay! Onto the next hand!
female_removed_minor=excited,Not bad, but it’s just a ~clothing~, ~name~. Hope it wasn’t super sentimental!

0-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3=interested,Whoa, you have really good balance. I think I'd fall over if I tried that!
0-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:2=disappointed,I'm <i>kind of</i> all about the rebellion and stuff, so the fact that's a uniform is a bit dissappointing...
0-male_removing_minor,target:9s,targetStage:1=mad,W-w-what? Nonono, you have to come up with your <i>own</i> codename, 9S!
0-male_removing_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:3=disappointed,Yeah, I really love my jacket too. It's hard to strip stuff... that's so important.
0-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0=excited,I've seen you in your track uniform, Ryuji, so feel free to auto-advance a bit...
0-male_removing_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=interested,I guess "Mad Hatter" could work... I have so many questions!
0-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. Usually it's boys that are obsessed with shoes...
0-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:haru,marker:new_clothes=interested,Wait. How often <i>do</i> you two get new clothes? I've had these since I was... um... a lot younger.
0-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:haru,marker:dancing_night=happy,Oh. I thought we were wearing our iconic stuff! I guess we could bring our other outfits, though.
0-male_removed_minor=shocked,I still haven’t gotten a scratch yet!
0-male_removed_minor=calm,One down, a few more to go!
0-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=triumphant,Omigosh, do you <i>and</i> Ann go shoe shopping together? Is this why you're always busy? She wanted Makoto to go once, but in her words: "Never again."
0-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:4=excited,Anyway, okay, that's pretty cool!
0-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3=interested,Though Futaba likey <i>this</i> secret chest!

0-male_removed_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:3=excited,Y-you have heard of the Phantom Thieves, right? We could use a big, muscly guy like you.
0-male_removed_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:4=shocked,Relax, Mad Hatter! I don't want to fight you OR um... the o-o-other thing.
0-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=triumphant,Mwehehe. I'm having fun, but I still want to win, Skull!

0-female_removing_minor,target:haru,targetStage:2=happy,Ohh! Your sweater? That always looked really comfortable.
0-female_removing_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,marker:gwenette=interested,Gwen, are you and Marinette… Togetherrr?
0-female_removing_minor,target:jolyne,targetStage:1=excited,Your outfit reminds me of my Metaverse suit!
0-female_removing_minor,target:hanako,targetStage:2=shocked,Not because of your burns, or anything, it's just hard to flirt with--
0-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4=shocked,Be careful, Florina! I wouldn't want you to fall over!
0-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=awkward,Erm. Please don't execute Chiaki though.
0-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=awkward,Oh. I thought that was a bit more of a personal item. It does look super nice for a school uniform.
0-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=awkward,Oh, I thought your cardigan was similar to my jacket. Just something personal.
0-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity=triumphant,You <i>really</i> do have to introduce me to this Mineta person, Uravity… but er… as to the makeup stuff…
0-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=shocked,It helps with accuracy and evasion. So it makes sense that you’d be a speed master.
0-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=triumphant,Whoa, Aimee, if this is your off-spec weapon, I’d love to see what you’d do with a Triple Down with your main!
0-female_removing_minor,target:ann,targetStage:0=shocked,Wow, Ann, you’ve had that jacket for a long time.
0-female_removing_minor,target:ann,targetStage:0,marker:schoolgirl=triumphant,Are you going for the sexy schoolgirl look, Ann?
0-female_removing_minor,target:ann,targetStage:0=excited,You know Ann, i-i-if I took the next one off for you, m-m-maybe the others would really like it.
0-female_removing_minor,target:haru,targetStage:1=excited,I guess you have more curves than I do. The only curves I tend to break are high scores.
0-female_removing_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:0=triumphant,I’m the smart one here though, so don’t act like you can quite measure up.
0-female_removing_minor,target:monika,targetStage:1=interested,It's been years since any of the Phantom Thieves have been able to use Cognitive Psience...
0-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=awkward,O-oh. W-well...
0-female_removing_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:2=interested,Lotte! I just realized something!
0-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3=excited,J-j-just like you seem to be, now.
0-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=annoyed,I-it's not like I want to get in the giant robot or anything.
0-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2=happy,You even did your eyebrows. I think that's so cool. I tried dying my hair once too...
0-female_removing_minor,target:raven,targetStage:0=mad,No, like, your real name. Y-you are using a Persona, aren't you? Raven's your codename?
0-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2=interested,I like your thights though... thigh-high-tights, obvi!
0-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2=interested,Those thights are cute though. Did you tear them around the edges, though?
0-female_removing_minor,target:sola,targetStage:3=shocked,Wait, <i>and</i> you're wearing panties!?
0-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=triumphant,Well, I pay attention when people are talking. Especially people with superpowers!
0-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=triumphant,Oh that's easy! I just have a really good memory for trivia! Plus that costume seems <i>really</i> comfy. Though...

0-female_removing_minor,target:miko,targetStage:0=shocked,Wait <i>what</i>? Is that a Persona!? How did you summon her?
0-female_removing_minor,target:merula,targetStage:0=nyoro,Not feeling so <i>snide</i> now, are you?
0-female_removing_minor,target:merula,targetStage:1=interested,You meant like, in a video game, or a trading card game, o-o-or--
0-female_removed_minor=excited,Yes! I’ve got this down!
0-female_removed_minor=happy,Feel free to keep losing, ~name~, it’s more fun that way.
0-female_removed_minor=interested,When you say someone’s behind you in this, do they mean that in a sexy way or pragmatic way...
0-female_removed_minor=triumphant,Remembering the algorithms for card sorting is definitely paying off!
0-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=awkward,I’m sorry. I feel pretty bad about this.
0-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=mad,Ururghgugh. Why can’t you just be an obnoxious nuisance like the pretty boy detective?
0-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5=awkward,If I end up having to take off my thights--thigh high tights, it’s easy to contract--I’ll definitely be more careful than Florina. I-I-It’s not really sexy to be so clumsy. I think. R-r-right?
0-female_removed_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:4=interested,You do seem to be a bit more outgoing, though… Even though you're losing?
0-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette=triumphant,Marinette, even I can tell that you’re flirting a lot!
0-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1=disappointed,Oh. Well, okay then. I thought you knew something I didn't.
0-female_removed_minor,target:haru,targetStage:2=awkward,Modesty? Aww... I was expecting something... <i>different</i>, Haru.
0-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3=awkward,(She could really use a friend, but I'm not sure how to help her here. This is really difficult firewall!)
0-female_removed_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:3=triumphant,We're going to keep our glasses, right? So cool. I mean, being able to see. And you're cool too! And stuff.
0-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan=interested,For deviance's sake I'm honored to share the table with you!
0-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:saki,saidMarker:saki_friendship=interested,We could all play together, Saki! Since we already had plans, I don't mind if Chiaki joins in!
0-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:saki,saidMarker:saki_friendship=triumphant,I'm coming too, and I'm gonna kick both your butts! What a great way to relax after this!
0-female_removed_minor,target:misato,targetStage:3=triumphant,See? How was that impression? Good or what!?
0-female_removed_minor,target:ann,targetStage:1=awkward,You know, I knew we’d be friends since I saw your sweater! The four-leaf clover reminds me of that old website. You know, Futaba-channel?
0-female_removed_minor,target:ann,targetStage:1=happy,I think Joker misses you, Ann! You should text him more often.
0-female_removed_minor,target:haru,targetStage:3=shocked,Not as comfy as mine... Y-your jacket. Not your boobs. I mean, those are more comfortable. But that's your utility, not mine!
0-female_removed_minor,target:meia=excited,That’s just as cool!
0-female_removed_minor,target:miko,targetStage:1=mad,You can't just summon a Persona and be surprised!

0-female_removed_minor,target:merula,targetStage:2=disappointed,S-shut up. I knew we were already playing cards.
0-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=interested,Oh, you and Raven know each other, Zone-tan? Raven, are her animations as sexy as Zone-tan acts?
0-female_removed_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:3=awkward,I'm a little bit frustrated I couldn't try that on! I'm just so much smaller than you!
0-female_removed_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:3=interested,I know I'm smart! But who's Mineta? She must be super graceful and insightful!
0-female_removed_minor,target:jolyne,targetStage:2=awkward,Um... sorry, it's kind of hard to explain. For some reason I keep forgetting you don't have a Persona...
0-female_removed_minor,target:hanako,targetStage:3=awkward,Er... someone I'm not... you know, nevermind.
0-female_removed_minor,target:monika,targetStage:2=disappointed,But I'm not seeing a Persona for you... or a codename, for that matter...
0-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:saki,notSaidMarker:saki_friendship,marker:saki_friendship=interested,Whoa, I want to play too, both of you. Third player always has the best mechanics!
0-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:saki,notSaidMarker:saki_friendship,marker:saki_friendship=happy,Mwehehe, we should all play together!
0-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:4=annoyed,Stockings? I didn't know your ribbon was protecting you from a fear status effect. They're <i>thights</i>, <i>thigh-high-tights,</i> Chiaki!
0-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:please_dont_be_too_rough=nyoro,Oh c-c-come on, isn't this a <i>little</i> hot, Sola?
0-female_removed_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:ann=happy,See, Ann! Other people like to try on costumes. But why is everyone else's just so... big on me? I wanted to try yours the most! So red!

0-female_removed_minor,target:merula,targetStage:1=gremlin,Get it? Because you're a jerk and it's your last name. Mwehehehe.
0-female_removed_minor,target:ann,targetStage:7,marker:futaba_girls_questionmark=mad,Ann! N-n-no-- I m-m-mean, yes? For this game? Um. I'm-- Not... Hnurhgughnrg!

0-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=annoyed,This isn't some sort of PvP game, so don't loot her jacket!
0-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=calm,It turns out green doesn't overlay on naturally red hair... kind of surprising, how exotic Japanese hair can be, right?
0-female_removed_minor,target:ann,targetStage:1,saidMarker:schoolgirl=shocked,I thought about emulating that for this game… But I definitely think my casualwear is what people like most.
0-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity=excited,It’s like a buff for your charisma stat, I guess. Hnrnhgmrhm. Okay! Yes! Saki, let’s go with Uravity! We’d need to see a real expert cleric of beauty if we do this!

1-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=awkward,O-oh. W-well...
1-female_removing_minor,target:ann,targetStage:0=shocked,Wow, Ann, you’ve had that jacket for a long time.
1-female_removing_minor,target:ann,targetStage:0,marker:schoolgirl=triumphant,Are you going for the sexy schoolgirl look, Ann?
1-female_removing_minor,target:ann,targetStage:0=excited,You know Ann, i-i-if I took the next one off for you, m-m-maybe the others would really like it.
1-female_removing_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:2=interested,Lotte! I just realized something!
1-female_removing_minor,target:zone-tan=awkward,I'm--Well, not surprised, b-b-but--
1-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3=excited,J-j-just like you seem to be, now.
1-female_removing_minor,target:meia=shocked,Oh wait, you <i>do</i>?
1-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=awkward,Oh. I thought that was a bit more of a personal item. It does look super nice for a school uniform.
1-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=awkward,Oh, I thought your cardigan was similar to my jacket. Just something personal.
1-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=annoyed,I-it's not like I want to get in the giant robot or anything.
1-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=triumphant,Well, I pay attention when people are talking. Especially people with superpowers!
1-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=triumphant,Oh that's easy! I just have a really good memory for trivia! Plus that costume seems <i>really</i> comfy. Though...
1-female_removing_minor,target:merula,targetStage:1=interested,You meant like, in a video game, or a trading card game, o-o-or--
1-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2=happy,You even did your eyebrows. I think that's so cool. I tried dying my hair once too...
1-female_removing_minor,target:sola,targetStage:3=shocked,Wait, <i>and</i> you're wearing panties!?
1-female_removing_minor,target:hanako,targetStage:2=shocked,Not because of your burns, or anything, it's just hard to flirt with--
1-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=shocked,It helps with accuracy and evasion. So it makes sense that you’d be a speed master.
1-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=triumphant,Whoa, Aimee, if this is your off-spec weapon, I’d love to see what you’d do with a Triple Down with your main!
1-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2=interested,I like your thights though... thigh-high-tights, obvi!
1-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2=interested,Those thights are cute though. Did you tear them around the edges, though?
1-female_removing_minor,target:monika,targetStage:1=interested,It's been years since any of the Phantom Thieves have been able to use Cognitive Psience...
1-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4=shocked,Be careful, Florina! I wouldn't want you to fall over!
1-female_removing_minor,target:miko,targetStage:0=shocked,Wait <i>what</i>? Is that a Persona!? How did you summon her?
1-female_removed_minor=excited,Okay! Now that you’ve started losing serious pieces, we can start having fun!
1-female_removed_minor=triumphant,Seriously, ~name~, I’m pretty good at this, I hope you don’t think that was it!
1-female_removed_minor=interested,Unf. How did you get such a soft... ~clothing~, ~name~?
1-female_removed_minor=happy,I kind of want to see you take that off again. Maybe on New Game+?
1-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=awkward,(Though if you wanted to teach me magic I’d definitely actually really be interested in that okay thanks.)
1-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:saki,notSaidMarker:saki_friendship,marker:saki_friendship=interested,Whoa, I want to play too, both of you. Third player always has the best mechanics!
1-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:saki,notSaidMarker:saki_friendship,marker:saki_friendship=happy,Mwehehe, we should all play together!
1-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3=awkward,(She could really use a friend, but I'm not sure how to help her here. This is really difficult firewall!)
1-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan=interested,For deviance's sake I'm honored to share the table with you!
1-female_removed_minor,target:misato,targetStage:3=triumphant,See? How was that impression? Good or what!?
1-female_removed_minor,target:miko,targetStage:1=mad,You can't just summon a Persona and be surprised!
1-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:saki,saidMarker:saki_friendship=interested,We could all play together, Saki! Since we already had plans, I don't mind if Chiaki joins in!
1-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:saki,saidMarker:saki_friendship=triumphant,I'm coming too, and I'm gonna kick both your butts! What a great way to relax after this!
1-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1=disappointed,Oh. Well, okay then. I thought you knew something I didn't.
1-female_removed_minor,target:haru,targetStage:2=awkward,Modesty? Aww... I was expecting something... <i>different</i>, Haru.
1-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette=triumphant,Marinette, even I can tell that you’re flirting a lot!
1-female_removed_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:4=interested,You do seem to be a bit more outgoing, though… Even though you're losing?
1-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5=awkward,If I end up having to take off my thights--thigh high tights, it’s easy to contract--I’ll definitely be more careful than Florina. I-I-It’s not really sexy to be so clumsy. I think. R-r-right?
1-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=calm,It turns out green doesn't overlay on naturally red hair... kind of surprising, how exotic Japanese hair can be, right?
1-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=interested,Oh, you and Raven know each other, Zone-tan? Raven, are her animations as sexy as Zone-tan acts?
1-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:4=annoyed,Stockings? I didn't know your ribbon was protecting you from a fear status effect. They're <i>thights</i>, <i>thigh-high-tights,</i> Chiaki!
1-female_removed_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:ann=happy,See, Ann! Other people like to try on costumes. But why is everyone else's just so... big on me? I wanted to try yours the most! So red!
1-female_removed_minor,target:hanako,targetStage:3=awkward,Er... someone I'm not... you know, nevermind.
1-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=annoyed,Yeah! Don't mess with her stuff! Jackets are really important to lots of people!
1-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=annoyed,This isn't some sort of PvP game, so don't loot her jacket!
1-female_removed_minor,target:jolyne,targetStage:2=awkward,Um... sorry, it's kind of hard to explain. For some reason I keep forgetting you don't have a Persona...
1-female_removed_minor,target:ann,targetStage:1,saidMarker:schoolgirl=shocked,I thought about emulating that for this game… But I definitely think my casualwear is what people like most.
1-female_removed_minor,target:ann,targetStage:7,marker:futaba_girls_questionmark=mad,Ann! N-n-no-- I m-m-mean, yes? For this game? Um. I'm-- Not... Hnurhgughnrg!
1-female_removed_minor,target:merula,targetStage:1=gremlin,Get it? Because you're a jerk and it's your last name. Mwehehehe.
1-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:please_dont_be_too_rough=nyoro,Oh c-c-come on, isn't this a <i>little</i> hot, Sola?
1-female_removed_minor,target:monika,targetStage:2=disappointed,But I'm not seeing a Persona for you... or a codename, for that matter...
1-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:sei_pirate_song,alsoPlaying:meia,notSaidMarker:sei_pirate_song,marker:sei_pirate_song=triumphant,Hey! Don’t pervert a perfectly good meme because you’re mad at Meia, Sei!
1-female_removed_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:3=triumphant,We're going to keep our glasses, right? So cool. I mean, being able to see. And you're cool too! And stuff.
1-female_removed_minor,target:ann,targetStage:1=awkward,You know, I knew we’d be friends since I saw your sweater! The four-leaf clover reminds me of that old website. You know, Futaba-channel?
1-female_removed_minor,target:ann,targetStage:1=happy,I think Joker misses you, Ann! You should text him more often.
1-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba,saidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba=happy,Yeah! Saki'll have a great time with this! Good ideas, Marinette! And if not, we can just hang out in my apartment or something easy.
1-female_removed_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:3=awkward,I'm a little bit frustrated I couldn't try that on! I'm just so much smaller than you!
1-female_removed_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:3=interested,I know I'm smart! But who's Mineta? She must be super graceful and insightful!
1-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=awkward,I’m sorry. I feel pretty bad about this.
1-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=mad,Ururghgugh. Why can’t you just be an obnoxious nuisance like the pretty boy detective?
1-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity=excited,It’s like a buff for your charisma stat, I guess. Hnrnhgmrhm. Okay! Yes! Saki, let’s go with Uravity! We’d need to see a real expert cleric of beauty if we do this!
1-female_removed_minor,target:meia=excited,That’s just as cool!
1-female_removed_minor,target:merula,targetStage:2=disappointed,S-shut up. I knew we were already playing cards.

2-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:2=disappointed,I'm <i>kind of</i> all about the rebellion and stuff, so the fact that's a uniform is a bit dissappointing...
2-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. Usually it's boys that are obsessed with shoes...
2-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3=interested,Whoa, you have really good balance. I think I'd fall over if I tried that!
2-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0=excited,I've seen you in your track uniform, Ryuji, so feel free to auto-advance a bit...
2-male_removing_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=interested,I guess "Mad Hatter" could work... I have so many questions!

2-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:haru,marker:dancing_night=happy,Oh. I thought we were wearing our iconic stuff! I guess we could bring our other outfits, though.
2-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=triumphant,Omigosh, do you <i>and</i> Ann go shoe shopping together? Is this why you're always busy? She wanted Makoto to go once, but in her words: "Never again."
2-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=triumphant,Mwehehe. I'm having fun, but I still want to win, Skull!
2-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:4=excited,Anyway, okay, that's pretty cool!

2-male_removed_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:3=excited,Y-you have heard of the Phantom Thieves, right? We could use a big, muscly guy like you.

3-male_removed_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:3=excited,Y-you have heard of the Phantom Thieves, right? We could use a big, muscly guy like you.
3-female_removing_minor,target:ann,targetStage:0=shocked,Wow, Ann, you’ve had that jacket for a long time.
3-female_removing_minor,target:ann,targetStage:0,marker:schoolgirl=triumphant,Are you going for the sexy schoolgirl look, Ann?
3-female_removing_minor,target:ann,targetStage:0=excited,You know Ann, i-i-if I took the next one off for you, m-m-maybe the others would really like it.
3-female_removing_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,marker:gwenette=interested,Gwen, are you and Marinette… Togetherrr?
3-female_removing_minor,target:hanako,targetStage:2=shocked,Not because of your burns, or anything, it's just hard to flirt with--
3-female_removing_minor,target:merula,targetStage:0=nyoro,Not feeling so <i>snide</i> now, are you?
3-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=awkward,Erm. Please don't execute Chiaki though.
3-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=awkward,Oh. I thought that was a bit more of a personal item. It does look super nice for a school uniform.
3-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=awkward,Oh, I thought your cardigan was similar to my jacket. Just something personal.
3-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=triumphant,Well, I pay attention when people are talking. Especially people with superpowers!
3-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=triumphant,Oh that's easy! I just have a really good memory for trivia! Plus that costume seems <i>really</i> comfy. Though...
3-female_removing_minor,target:haru,targetStage:1=excited,I guess you have more curves than I do. The only curves I tend to break are high scores.
3-female_removing_minor,target:miko,targetStage:0=shocked,Wait <i>what</i>? Is that a Persona!? How did you summon her?
3-female_removing_minor,target:zone-tan=triumphant,That'd definitely give me the edge I need to make you lose!
3-female_removing_minor,target:meia=shocked,Oh wait, you <i>do</i>?
3-female_removing_minor,target:sola,targetStage:3=shocked,Wait, <i>and</i> you're wearing panties!?
3-female_removing_minor,target:merula,targetStage:1=interested,You meant like, in a video game, or a trading card game, o-o-or--
3-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2=interested,I like your thights though... thigh-high-tights, obvi!
3-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2=interested,Those thights are cute though. Did you tear them around the edges, though?
3-female_removing_minor,target:raven,targetStage:0=mad,No, like, your real name. Y-you are using a Persona, aren't you? Raven's your codename?
3-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2=happy,You even did your eyebrows. I think that's so cool. I tried dying my hair once too...
3-female_removing_minor,target:monika,targetStage:1=interested,It's been years since any of the Phantom Thieves have been able to use Cognitive Psience...
3-female_removing_minor,target:florina,targetStage:4=shocked,Be careful, Florina! I wouldn't want you to fall over!
3-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=annoyed,I-it's not like I want to get in the giant robot or anything.
3-female_removing_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:2=interested,Lotte! I just realized something!
3-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=awkward,O-oh. W-well...
3-female_removing_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:0=triumphant,I’m the smart one here though, so don’t act like you can quite measure up.

3-female_removing_minor,target:jolyne,targetStage:1=excited,Your outfit reminds me of my Metaverse suit!
3-female_removing_minor,target:haru,targetStage:2=happy,Ohh! Your sweater? That always looked really comfortable.
3-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3=excited,J-j-just like you seem to be, now.
3-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=shocked,It helps with accuracy and evasion. So it makes sense that you’d be a speed master.
3-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=triumphant,Whoa, Aimee, if this is your off-spec weapon, I’d love to see what you’d do with a Triple Down with your main!
3-female_removed_minor,target:merula,targetStage:1=gremlin,Get it? Because you're a jerk and it's your last name. Mwehehehe.
3-female_removed_minor,target:hanako,targetStage:3=awkward,Er... someone I'm not... you know, nevermind.
3-female_removed_minor,target:merula,targetStage:2=disappointed,S-shut up. I knew we were already playing cards.
3-female_removed_minor,target:misato,targetStage:3=triumphant,See? How was that impression? Good or what!?
3-female_removed_minor,target:miko,targetStage:1=mad,You can't just summon a Persona and be surprised!
3-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba,saidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba=happy,Yeah! Saki'll have a great time with this! Good ideas, Marinette! And if not, we can just hang out in my apartment or something easy.

3-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:saki,notSaidMarker:saki_friendship,marker:saki_friendship=interested,Whoa, I want to play too, both of you. Third player always has the best mechanics!
3-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:saki,notSaidMarker:saki_friendship,marker:saki_friendship=happy,Mwehehe, we should all play together!
3-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:saki,saidMarker:saki_friendship=interested,We could all play together, Saki! Since we already had plans, I don't mind if Chiaki joins in!
3-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:saki,saidMarker:saki_friendship=triumphant,I'm coming too, and I'm gonna kick both your butts! What a great way to relax after this!
3-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette=triumphant,Marinette, even I can tell that you’re flirting a lot!
3-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=interested,Oh, you and Raven know each other, Zone-tan? Raven, are her animations as sexy as Zone-tan acts?
3-female_removed_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:ann=happy,See, Ann! Other people like to try on costumes. But why is everyone else's just so... big on me? I wanted to try yours the most! So red!
3-female_removed_minor,target:ann,targetStage:1,saidMarker:schoolgirl=shocked,I thought about emulating that for this game… But I definitely think my casualwear is what people like most.
3-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:please_dont_be_too_rough=nyoro,Oh c-c-come on, isn't this a <i>little</i> hot, Sola?
3-female_removed_minor,target:ann,targetStage:1=awkward,You know, I knew we’d be friends since I saw your sweater! The four-leaf clover reminds me of that old website. You know, Futaba-channel?
3-female_removed_minor,target:ann,targetStage:1=happy,I think Joker misses you, Ann! You should text him more often.
3-female_removed_minor,target:ann,targetStage:7,marker:futaba_girls_questionmark=mad,Ann! N-n-no-- I m-m-mean, yes? For this game? Um. I'm-- Not... Hnurhgughnrg!
3-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=annoyed,Yeah! Don't mess with her stuff! Jackets are really important to lots of people!
3-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=annoyed,This isn't some sort of PvP game, so don't loot her jacket!
3-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:4=annoyed,Stockings? I didn't know your ribbon was protecting you from a fear status effect. They're <i>thights</i>, <i>thigh-high-tights,</i> Chiaki!
3-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5=awkward,If I end up having to take off my thights--thigh high tights, it’s easy to contract--I’ll definitely be more careful than Florina. I-I-It’s not really sexy to be so clumsy. I think. R-r-right?
3-female_removed_minor,target:jolyne,targetStage:2=awkward,Um... sorry, it's kind of hard to explain. For some reason I keep forgetting you don't have a Persona...
3-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan=awkward,T-t-though I must admit I'm <i>quite</i> the fan of your work...
3-female_removed_minor,target:monika,targetStage:2=disappointed,But I'm not seeing a Persona for you... or a codename, for that matter...
3-female_removed_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:4=interested,You do seem to be a bit more outgoing, though… Even though you're losing?
3-female_removed_minor,target:haru,targetStage:2=awkward,Modesty? Aww... I was expecting something... <i>different</i>, Haru.
3-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=calm,It turns out green doesn't overlay on naturally red hair... kind of surprising, how exotic Japanese hair can be, right?
3-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1=disappointed,Oh. Well, okay then. I thought you knew something I didn't.
3-female_removed_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:3=triumphant,We're going to keep our glasses, right? So cool. I mean, being able to see. And you're cool too! And stuff.
3-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity=excited,It’s like a buff for your charisma stat, I guess. Hnrnhgmrhm. Okay! Yes! Saki, let’s go with Uravity! We’d need to see a real expert cleric of beauty if we do this!
3-female_removed_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:3=awkward,I'm a little bit frustrated I couldn't try that on! I'm just so much smaller than you!
3-female_removed_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:3=interested,I know I'm smart! But who's Mineta? She must be super graceful and insightful!
3-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=awkward,I’m sorry. I feel pretty bad about this.
3-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=mad,Ururghgugh. Why can’t you just be an obnoxious nuisance like the pretty boy detective?
3-female_removed_minor,target:meia=excited,That’s just as cool!
3-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=awkward,(Though if you wanted to teach me magic I’d definitely actually really be interested in that okay thanks.)
3-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3=awkward,(She could really use a friend, but I'm not sure how to help her here. This is really difficult firewall!)


#lost thigh-highs
4-male_removing_minor=mad,Urugugh. I know my last piece was pretty minor, but I’m really getting down to almost nothing here, ~name~.
4-male_removing_minor=excited,Well, ~name~, you might be about to see something really good. S-s-so if you could play a little worse, just to make it worth it...
4-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0=excited,I've seen you in your track uniform, Ryuji, so feel free to auto-advance a bit...
4-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:haru,marker:new_clothes=interested,Wait. How often <i>do</i> you two get new clothes? I've had these since I was... um... a lot younger.
4-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:haru,marker:dancing_night=happy,Oh. I thought we were wearing our iconic stuff! I guess we could bring our other outfits, though.
4-male_removing_minor,target:9s,targetStage:1=mad,W-w-what? Nonono, you have to come up with your <i>own</i> codename, 9S!
4-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3=interested,Wow, Jin, I kinda wanted to try that but I'd totally have fallen over!
4-male_removing_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:3=disappointed,Yeah, I really love my jacket too. It's hard to strip stuff... that's so important.
4-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:2=disappointed,I'm <i>kind of</i> all about the rebellion and stuff, so the fact that's a uniform is a bit dissappointing...
4-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. Usually it's boys that are obsessed with shoes...
4-male_removing_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=interested,I guess "Mad Hatter" could work... I have so many questions!
4-male_removed_minor=disappointed,Huruglerhf.
4-male_removed_minor=shocked,Really, ~name~, is this how you want to play? Just delaying tactics?
4-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2=calm,Huh. That’s… Hm. Hrrrrm. Okay. Oathkeeper it is!

4-male_removed_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:4=shocked,Relax, Mad Hatter! I don't want to fight you OR um... the o-o-other thing.
4-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=triumphant,Omigosh, do you <i>and</i> Ann go shoe shopping together? Is this why you're always busy? She wanted Makoto to go once, but in her words: "Never again."
4-female_removing_minor=excited,Y-you know, ~name~, some people <i>really</i> like it when you strip in unison...
4-female_removing_minor=awkward,I’m just saying, ~name~, if you wanted to remove something bigger, I’m sure people would like it.
4-female_removing_minor=shocked,I didn’t go to university, ace all my classes, and then come here to watch you futz around, ~name~!
4-female_removing_minor=disappointed,Okay, ~name~, try and keep up, alright?
4-female_removing_minor,target:miko,targetStage:0=shocked,Wait <i>what</i>? Is that a Persona!? How did you summon her?
4-female_removing_minor,target:sola,targetStage:3=shocked,Wait, <i>and</i> you're wearing panties!?
4-female_removing_minor,target:zone-tan=excited,But the actual card game seems like something you're <i>really</i> skilled at!

#lost tanktop
5-male_removing_minor=disappointed,Okay, ~name~, as long as that’s the last of that...
5-male_removing_minor=awkward,~Name~, they may not be as impressive as… Hers… But you really could be more considerate.
5-male_removing_minor,target:9s,targetStage:1=mad,W-w-what? Nonono, you have to come up with your <i>own</i> codename, 9S!
5-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:2=disappointed,I'm <i>kind of</i> all about the rebellion and stuff, so the fact that's a uniform is a bit dissappointing...
5-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0=excited,I've seen you in your track uniform, Ryuji, so feel free to auto-advance a bit...
5-male_removing_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=interested,I guess "Mad Hatter" could work... I have so many questions!
5-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. Usually it's boys that are obsessed with shoes...
5-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:haru,marker:new_clothes=interested,Wait. How often <i>do</i> you two get new clothes? I've had these since I was... um... a lot younger.
5-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:haru,marker:dancing_night=happy,Oh. I thought we were wearing our iconic stuff! I guess we could bring our other outfits, though.
5-male_removing_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:3=disappointed,Yeah, I really love my jacket too. It's hard to strip stuff... that's so important.
5-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3=interested,Wow, Jin, I kinda wanted to try that but I'd totally have fallen over!
5-male_removed_minor=triumphant,Come on, ~name~, show us the goods!
5-male_removed_minor=excited,Fiiiine, but this better be good later!
5-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2=calm,Huh. That’s… Hm. Hrrrrm. Okay. Oathkeeper it is!
5-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=triumphant,Omigosh, do you <i>and</i> Ann go shoe shopping together? Is this why you're always busy? She wanted Makoto to go once, but in her words: "Never again."
5-male_removed_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:3=excited,Y-you have heard of the Phantom Thieves, right? We could use a big, muscly guy like you.
5-male_removed_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:4=shocked,Relax, Mad Hatter! I don't want to fight you OR um... the o-o-other thing.
5-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3=interested,Though Futaba likey <i>this</i> secret chest!
5-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=triumphant,Mwehehe. I'm having fun, but I still want to win, Skull!
5-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:4=excited,Anyway, okay, that's pretty cool!
5-female_removing_minor=mad,~Name~, come ooooooooooooooon!
5-female_removing_minor=shocked,I have my t-t-tits out. And you’re just taking off ~clothing~?
5-female_removing_minor=awkward,I can’t really be doing this badly, can I?
5-female_removing_minor=disappointed,I thought enough time on the internet and in University would’ve taught me more...
5-female_removing_minor,target:monika,targetStage:1=interested,It's been years since any of the Phantom Thieves have been able to use Cognitive Psience...
5-female_removing_minor,target:merula,targetStage:0=nyoro,Not feeling so <i>snide</i> now, are you?
5-female_removing_minor,target:zone-tan=excited,But the actual card game seems like something you're <i>really</i> skilled at!
5-female_removing_minor,target:meia=shocked,Oh wait, you <i>do</i>?
5-female_removing_minor,target:jolyne,targetStage:1=excited,Your outfit reminds me of my Metaverse suit!
5-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity=triumphant,You <i>really</i> do have to introduce me to this Mineta person, Uravity… but er… as to the makeup stuff…
5-female_removing_minor,target:hanako,targetStage:2=shocked,Not because of your burns, or anything, it's just hard to flirt with--
5-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=triumphant,Well, I pay attention when people are talking. Especially people with superpowers!
5-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=triumphant,Oh that's easy! I just have a really good memory for trivia! Plus that costume seems <i>really</i> comfy. Though...
5-female_removing_minor,target:sola,targetStage:3=shocked,Wait, <i>and</i> you're wearing panties!?
5-female_removing_minor,target:raven,targetStage:0=mad,No, like, your real name. Y-you are using a Persona, aren't you? Raven's your codename?
5-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=awkward,Erm. Please don't execute Chiaki though.
5-female_removing_minor,target:haru,targetStage:1=excited,I guess you have more curves than I do. The only curves I tend to break are high scores.
5-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2=happy,You even did your eyebrows. I think that's so cool. I tried dying my hair once too...
5-female_removing_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:2=interested,Lotte! I just realized something!
5-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2=interested,I like your thights though... thigh-high-tights, obvi!
5-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2=interested,Those thights are cute though. Did you tear them around the edges, though?
5-female_removing_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:0=triumphant,I’m the smart one here though, so don’t act like you can quite measure up.
5-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=awkward,Oh. I thought that was a bit more of a personal item. It does look super nice for a school uniform.
5-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=awkward,Oh, I thought your cardigan was similar to my jacket. Just something personal.
5-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=awkward,O-oh. W-well...
5-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=shocked,It helps with accuracy and evasion. So it makes sense that you’d be a speed master.
5-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=triumphant,Whoa, Aimee, if this is your off-spec weapon, I’d love to see what you’d do with a Triple Down with your main!
5-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=annoyed,I-it's not like I want to get in the giant robot or anything.
5-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba,saidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba=triumphant,If we're going to shop for clothes, why don't we also hit some arcades! I know I can pwn you at any cabinet in the place!
5-female_removing_minor,target:ann,targetStage:0=shocked,Wow, Ann, you’ve had that jacket for a long time.
5-female_removing_minor,target:ann,targetStage:0,marker:schoolgirl=triumphant,Are you going for the sexy schoolgirl look, Ann?
5-female_removing_minor,target:ann,targetStage:0=excited,You know Ann, i-i-if I took the next one off for you, m-m-maybe the others would really like it.
5-female_removing_minor,target:merula,targetStage:1=interested,You meant like, in a video game, or a trading card game, o-o-or--
5-female_removing_minor,target:miko,targetStage:0=shocked,Wait <i>what</i>? Is that a Persona!? How did you summon her?
5-female_removing_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,marker:gwenette=interested,Gwen, are you and Marinette… Togetherrr?
5-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3=excited,J-j-just like you seem to be, now.
5-female_removing_minor,target:haru,targetStage:2=happy,Ohh! Your sweater? That always looked really comfortable.
5-female_removed_minor=annoyed,You should at least match the newcomer, ~name~.
5-female_removed_minor=disappointed,I thought I would be better at this. It’s just counting.
5-female_removed_minor=shocked,I didn’t really even count the cards, but I’d rather not be losing like this.
5-female_removed_minor=mad,Hrrugmrhm. Maybe I should’ve learned more about people’s tells.
5-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1=disappointed,Oh. Well, okay then. I thought you knew something I didn't.
5-female_removed_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:3=triumphant,We're going to keep our glasses, right? So cool. I mean, being able to see. And you're cool too! And stuff.
5-female_removed_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:3=calm,It turns out green doesn't overlay on naturally red hair... kind of surprising, how exotic Japanese hair can be, right?
5-female_removed_minor,target:florina,targetStage:5=disappointed,I’m glad I had enough balance not to slip and fall…
5-female_removed_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:4=interested,You do seem to be a bit more outgoing, though… Even though you're losing?
5-female_removed_minor,target:misato,targetStage:3=triumphant,See? How was that impression? Good or what!?
5-female_removed_minor,target:merula,targetStage:1=gremlin,Get it? Because you're a jerk and it's your last name. Mwehehehe.
5-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3=awkward,(She could really use a friend, but I'm not sure how to help her here. This is really difficult firewall!)
5-female_removed_minor,target:monika,targetStage:2=disappointed,But I'm not seeing a Persona for you... or a codename, for that matter...
5-female_removed_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:3=awkward,I'm a little bit frustrated I couldn't try that on! I'm just so much smaller than you!
5-female_removed_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:3=interested,I know I'm smart! But who's Mineta? She must be super graceful and insightful!
5-female_removed_minor,target:merula,targetStage:2=disappointed,S-shut up. I knew we were already playing cards.
5-female_removed_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:1=awkward,(Though if you wanted to teach me magic I’d definitely actually really be interested in that okay thanks.)
5-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=awkward,I’m sorry. I feel pretty bad about this.
5-female_removed_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:6=mad,Ururghgugh. Why can’t you just be an obnoxious nuisance like the pretty boy detective?
5-female_removed_minor,target:raven,targetStage:1,alsoPlaying:zone-tan=interested,Oh, you and Raven know each other, Zone-tan? Raven, are her animations as sexy as Zone-tan acts?
5-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan=happy,Do you have some sort of mega interpersonal skill?
5-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity=excited,It’s like a buff for your charisma stat, I guess. Hnrnhgmrhm. Okay! Yes! Saki, let’s go with Uravity! We’d need to see a real expert cleric of beauty if we do this!
5-female_removed_minor,target:meia=excited,That’s just as cool!
5-female_removed_minor,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba,saidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba=happy,Yeah! Saki'll have a great time with this! Good ideas, Marinette! And if not, we can just hang out in my apartment or something easy.
5-female_removed_minor,target:sei,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:sei_pirate_song,alsoPlaying:meia,notSaidMarker:sei_pirate_song,marker:sei_pirate_song=triumphant,Hey! Don’t pervert a perfectly good meme because you’re mad at Meia, Sei!
5-female_removed_minor,target:miko,targetStage:1=mad,You can't just summon a Persona and be surprised!
5-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:saki,notSaidMarker:saki_friendship,marker:saki_friendship=interested,Whoa, I want to play too, both of you. Third player always has the best mechanics!
5-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:saki,notSaidMarker:saki_friendship,marker:saki_friendship=happy,Mwehehe, we should all play together!
5-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:saki,saidMarker:saki_friendship=interested,We could all play together, Saki! Since we already had plans, I don't mind if Chiaki joins in!
5-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:saki,saidMarker:saki_friendship=triumphant,I'm coming too, and I'm gonna kick both your butts! What a great way to relax after this!
5-female_removed_minor,target:hanako,targetStage:3=awkward,Er... someone I'm not... you know, nevermind.
5-female_removed_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:ann=happy,See, Ann! Other people like to try on costumes. But why is everyone else's just so... big on me? I wanted to try yours the most! So red!
5-female_removed_minor,target:gwen,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:marinette=triumphant,Marinette, even I can tell that you’re flirting a lot!
5-female_removed_minor,target:ann,targetStage:1,saidMarker:schoolgirl=shocked,I thought about emulating that for this game… But I definitely think my casualwear is what people like most.
5-female_removed_minor,target:sola,targetStage:4,targetSaidMarker:please_dont_be_too_rough=nyoro,Oh c-c-come on, isn't this a <i>little</i> hot, Sola?
5-female_removed_minor,target:ann,targetStage:1=awkward,You know, I knew we’d be friends since I saw your sweater! The four-leaf clover reminds me of that old website. You know, Futaba-channel?
5-female_removed_minor,target:ann,targetStage:1=happy,I think Joker misses you, Ann! You should text him more often.
5-female_removed_minor,target:ann,targetStage:7,marker:futaba_girls_questionmark=mad,Ann! N-n-no-- I m-m-mean, yes? For this game? Um. I'm-- Not... Hnurhgughnrg!
5-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=annoyed,Yeah! Don't mess with her stuff! Jackets are really important to lots of people!
5-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=annoyed,This isn't some sort of PvP game, so don't loot her jacket!
5-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:4=annoyed,Stockings? I didn't know your ribbon was protecting you from a fear status effect. They're <i>thights</i>, <i>thigh-high-tights,</i> Chiaki!
5-female_removed_minor,target:haru,targetStage:2=awkward,Modesty? Aww... I was expecting something... <i>different</i>, Haru.
5-female_removed_minor,target:jolyne,targetStage:2=awkward,Um... sorry, it's kind of hard to explain. For some reason I keep forgetting you don't have a Persona...

-3-female_removed_minor,target:miko,targetStage:1=mad,You can't just summon a Persona and be surprised!
-3-female_removed_minor,target:merula,targetStage:1=gremlin,Get it? Because you're a jerk and it's your last name. Mwehehehe.
-3-female_removed_minor,target:zone-tan=happy,Do you have some sort of mega interpersonal skill?
-3-female_removed_minor,target:meia=excited,That’s just as cool!

#masturbating
-2-male_removing_minor=interested,Okay, yes, ~clothing~, but more.
-2-male_removing_minor=awkward,~Name~, how am I supposed to think about you if you aren’t even nearly naked?
-2-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=interested,Huh. Usually it's boys that are obsessed with shoes...
-2-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3=interested,Wow, Jin, I kinda wanted to try that but I'd totally have fallen over!
-2-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0=excited,I've seen you in your track uniform, Ryuji, so feel free to auto-advance a bit...
-2-male_removing_minor,target:jin,targetStage:2=disappointed,I'm <i>kind of</i> all about the rebellion and stuff, so the fact that's a uniform is a bit dissappointing...
-2-male_removing_minor,target:9s,targetStage:1=mad,W-w-what? Nonono, you have to come up with your <i>own</i> codename, 9S!
-2-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:haru,marker:new_clothes=interested,Wait. How often <i>do</i> you two get new clothes? I've had these since I was... um... a lot younger.
-2-male_removing_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:0,alsoPlaying:haru,marker:dancing_night=happy,Oh. I thought we were wearing our iconic stuff! I guess we could bring our other outfits, though.
-2-male_removing_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:2=interested,I guess "Mad Hatter" could work... I have so many questions!
-2-male_removing_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:3=disappointed,Yeah, I really love my jacket too. It's hard to strip stuff... that's so important.
-2-male_removed_minor=excited,If I kissed one of the others, would that encourage you, ~name~? I won’t actually, just like you won’t strip important things.
-2-male_removed_minor=disappointed,Well... I guess I’ll just have to look inward...
-2-male_removed_minor,target:9s,targetStage:2=calm,Huh. That’s… Hm. Hrrrrm. Okay. Oathkeeper it is!
-2-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:3=interested,Though Futaba likey <i>this</i> secret chest!
-2-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:2=triumphant,Omigosh, do you <i>and</i> Ann go shoe shopping together? Is this why you're always busy? She wanted Makoto to go once, but in her words: "Never again."
-2-male_removed_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:3=excited,Y-you have heard of the Phantom Thieves, right? We could use a big, muscly guy like you.
-2-male_removed_minor,target:ryuji,targetStage:1=excited,Er... I've seen you shirtless, but I'm a little... cold over here... N-n-o, n-n-no, take your time. I <i>did</i> lose fair and square...
-2-male_removed_minor,target:jin,targetStage:4=excited,Anyway, okay, that's pretty cool!
-2-male_removed_minor,target:jotaro,targetStage:4=shocked,Relax, Mad Hatter! I don't want to fight you OR um... the o-o-other thing.
-2-female_removing_minor=excited,Mmf…~name~... Could you... Please... Ah...
-2-female_removing_minor=happy,~Name~... Please? More than that?
-2-female_removing_minor=shocked,~Name~...
-2-female_removing_minor=disappointed,Urgh. ~Clothing~ off, so that I can at least fap to more skin.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:jolyne,targetStage:1=excited,Your outfit reminds me of my Metaverse suit!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:zone-tan=excited,But the actual card game seems like something you're <i>really</i> skilled at!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:meia=shocked,Oh wait, you <i>do</i>?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:haru,targetStage:2=happy,Ohh! Your sweater? That always looked really comfortable.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:ann,targetStage:0=shocked,Wow, Ann, you’ve had that jacket for a long time.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:ann,targetStage:0,marker:schoolgirl=triumphant,Are you going for the sexy schoolgirl look, Ann?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:ann,targetStage:0=excited,You know Ann, i-i-if I took the next one off for you, m-m-maybe the others would really like it.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:merula,targetStage:1=interested,You meant like, in a video game, or a trading card game, o-o-or--
-2-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=triumphant,Well, I pay attention when people are talking. Especially people with superpowers!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:uravity,targetStage:2=triumphant,Oh that's easy! I just have a really good memory for trivia! Plus that costume seems <i>really</i> comfy. Though...
-2-female_removing_minor,target:sola,targetStage:3=shocked,Wait, <i>and</i> you're wearing panties!?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:hermione,targetStage:0=triumphant,I’m the smart one here though, so don’t act like you can quite measure up.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2=interested,I like your thights though... thigh-high-tights, obvi!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2=interested,Those thights are cute though. Did you tear them around the edges, though?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:raven,targetStage:0=mad,No, like, your real name. Y-you are using a Persona, aren't you? Raven's your codename?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=awkward,O-oh. W-well...
-2-female_removing_minor,target:natsuki,targetStage:2=happy,You even did your eyebrows. I think that's so cool. I tried dying my hair once too...
-2-female_removing_minor,target:monika,targetStage:1=interested,It's been years since any of the Phantom Thieves have been able to use Cognitive Psience...
-2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=shocked,It helps with accuracy and evasion. So it makes sense that you’d be a speed master.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:aimee,targetStage:1=triumphant,Whoa, Aimee, if this is your off-spec weapon, I’d love to see what you’d do with a Triple Down with your main!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:misato,targetStage:2=annoyed,I-it's not like I want to get in the giant robot or anything.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:hanako,targetStage:2=shocked,Not because of your burns, or anything, it's just hard to flirt with--
-2-female_removing_minor,target:marinette,targetStage:3=excited,J-j-just like you seem to be, now.

-2-female_removing_minor,target:miko,targetStage:0=shocked,Wait <i>what</i>? Is that a Persona!? How did you summon her?
-2-female_removing_minor,target:haru,targetStage:1=excited,I guess you have more curves than I do. The only curves I tend to break are high scores.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:3=awkward,Erm. Please don't execute Chiaki though.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:saki,targetStage:2,alsoPlaying:marinette,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba,saidMarker:saki_befriend_mariba=triumphant,If we're going to shop for clothes, why don't we also hit some arcades! I know I can pwn you at any cabinet in the place!
-2-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=awkward,Oh. I thought that was a bit more of a personal item. It does look super nice for a school uniform.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:2=awkward,Oh, I thought your cardigan was similar to my jacket. Just something personal.
-2-female_removing_minor,target:lotte,targetStage:2=interested,Lotte! I just realized something!
-2-female_removed_minor=annoyed,I didn’t really even count the cards, but I’d rather not be losing like this.
-2-female_removed_minor=awkward,You should at least match the newcomer, ~name~.
-2-female_removed_minor=shocked,I thought I would be better at this. It’s just counting. I do that when I’m… Uhm. Rubbing.

-2-female_removed_minor,target:chiaki,targetStage:4=annoyed,Stockings? I didn't know your ribbon was protecting you from a fear status effect. They're <i>thights</i>, <i>thigh-high-tights,</i> Chiaki!

#OPPONENT REMOVING MAJOR CLOTHING
#Major clothing reveals a significant amount of skin and likely underwear.
#However, as we don't know if the opponent is taking off the top or the bottom, we can't presume that nice abs are showing; maybe she took of her skirt before her shirt.

#fully clothed
0-male_removing_major=excited,Yeah! Take it off, ~name~!
0-male_removing_major=interested,Your ~clothing~, already, ~name~?
0-male_removing_major,target:9s,targetStage:3=excited,You’d make a good Phantom Thief, Nines. Er, Oathkeeper. You seem good at keeping things under wraps…
0-male_removing_major,target:jotaro,targetStage:5=nyoro,Mwehehehe. Sorry, was I staring? I just... wanna see it!

0-male_removed_major,target:jotaro,targetStage:6=shocked,I wasn't... um... expecting underwear, but those pants are super expensive! B-but my headphones are worth that much, so I'll keep them on.
0-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4=shocked,The only thing worth stealing is hearts. And information you can use to propel yourself to a more successful state in life.

0-female_removing_major=happy,Aww yiss, a big old ~clothing~.
0-female_removing_major=triumphant,Futaba: Full HP! ~name~ is looking critical!
0-female_removing_major=shocked,~Name~, your ~clothing~? Wow! You’re fast!
0-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=shocked,So how does that Lucky Charm thing of yours work, Marinette? It doesn’t seem to do much good now!
0-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=excited,Does it help you get critical hits or something? Or maybe just increases drop rate? Ha! Get it, because you’re dropping your pants next!
0-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:4=happy,Oh! Clever, starting from bottom and going up. That's an unusual trace route...
0-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:3=interested,E-er, if it makes you feel better, Saki, I-- I um, have a-a-an--
0-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:2=shocked,<i>Nani</i>? Sorry, <i>what</i>?

0-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=shocked,Oh no! I'm sorry, Pathfinder! I didn't think your Persona was suffering from a status effect! Quick! Use a Nohar-M!
0-female_removing_major,target:merula,targetStage:3=awkward,Um... Merula... are you a little... shy?
0-female_removing_major,target:haru,targetStage:4=happy,Well, <i>I've</i> already seen this, pretty much. Right?

0-female_removing_major,target:blake,targetStage:3=disappointed,Why would you read about it in a book when there’s <i>so</i> much better animated fare out there?
0-female_removing_major,target:merula,targetStage:4=nyoro,Well, time to see your underwear... at least you were smart enough to wear some. Mweheheh.
0-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=triumphant,But now you’re gonna lose!
0-female_removing_major,target:morrigan,targetStage:2=annoyed,I still don’t trust you! Even if those are cool leggings!
0-female_removing_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4=interested,Lotte. Lotte. Tell me about your fanfiction. I-I mean, I could keep fake flirting but...
0-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=awkward,If you want me to look away, I can respect someone’s trauma--
0-female_removing_major,target:lotte,targetStage:3=nyoro,It's okay, Lotte, I didn't wear underwear either--
0-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:3=disappointed,B-b-because you’re awfully concerned with hiding your chest…
0-female_removing_major,target:merula,targetStage:5=gremlin,It's okay to like this. Losing the game, I mean. Mwheheh.
0-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=awkward,I kind of hate shirts that button up. It should be one smooth piece of fabric, IMO.
0-female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2=interested,Oh, you're taking off your hood...?
0-female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2=interested,That bra doesn't even look comfortable. Why didn't you just go naked, Raven?
0-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5=nyoro,I can promise you, Miko, some Japanese  women didn't even wear underwear to this game. Mwehehehe.
0-female_removing_major,target:ann,targetStage:1,saidMarker:futabawarnsann=annoyed,-st. Okay, Ann, you do you.
0-female_removing_major,target:zone-tan=awkward,Without your shoes or tights you seem petite like me.
0-female_removing_major,target:haru,targetStage:3=triumphant,Skirt or shirt! Skirt or shirt!
0-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:3,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity=happy,The three of us should go to karaoke and grab some drinks! This is what popular people do, right, so why shouldn’t we try it!
0-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:4=nyoro,Have you considered...
0-female_removing_major,target:d.va,targetStage:3=disappointed,I really miss Necronomicon… I looked so cool...
0-female_removing_major,target:ann,targetStage:3=annoyed,Hmm. Ann, this is just like… Adding… Oh. Okay, right. You’re mostly good with languages… Which is to say your t-t-tongue, right?
0-female_removing_major,target:ann,targetStage:3=awkward,Sorry if that was mean, Ann.
0-female_removing_major,target:ann,targetStage:3=triumphant,Oof. Ann, I think you need a Bead to come back from this. Of either variety!
0-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:0=interested,Oh! And now she's... removing her... Per...sona?
0-female_removing_major,target:monika,targetStage:3=shocked,You know, Mon-Ika? H-huh?
0-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2=interested,I just can't see a reason to take off your dress first otherwise.
0-female_removing_major,target:meia,marker:metaverse=interested,My preferred outfit was my black jumpsuit from the Metaverse!
0-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:4=interested,That's actually kind of clever. We already know what your panties look like, so this has to be... Way less embarrassing, right?
0-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:4=interested,Well, we've already seen your panties... But it's brave of you to keep going, right?
0-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,Gah! This isn’t the Metaverse, you shouldn’t be using that here!
0-female_removing_major,target:hanako,targetStage:3=annoyed,I just... won't say anything.
0-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1=interested,Pinkie! Pinkie Pie! Can you teach me how to be more confident?
0-female_removed_major=happy,Alright, ~name~, you’re almost done!
0-female_removed_major=calm,Okay, let’s keep focusing ~name~ down.
0-female_removed_major=triumphant,If you didn’t want to lose your ~clothing~, you probably should’ve played another game!
0-female_removed_major=shocked,~Name~ is in rough shape!
0-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4=shocked,A thong...? Hrhmgnrumn. I guess if you have the butt for it...
0-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:6=shocked,Those are like a raid boss!
0-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:6=shocked,Oh wow! Each of those has its own life bar!
0-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:5=triumphant,Mwehehehe. Your plan to be innosexy--innocent sexy-- is very clever, Saki!
0-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:5=triumphant,Mwehehehe. I'm going to steal the best parts of your plan for myself, Saki! Keep being brilliant!
0-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3=shocked,W-w-what? Your boobs! They're huge! That means you have huge sex appeal!
0-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=mad,Oh what the hell? Wh-wh-where’d these boobs come from?! And you’re not traumatized at all! Noob!
0-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=disappointed,Even Ann isn’t that protective! Um, my Ann. My friend Ann!
0-female_removed_major,target:merula,targetStage:5=triumphant,Oho! Were you <i>trying</i> to look sexy, instead of <i>being</i> sexy? L-like me!
0-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:5=gremlin,Git gud?
0-female_removed_major,target:uravity,targetStage:5=happy,What <i>iiiiiiiiiis</i> your fetish, Ochako? C'mon, you gotta tell me!
0-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:3=interested,Cute panties, though.
0-female_removed_major,target:meg,targetStage:6=awkward,Hmmurmrhm... I know most redheads are from Europe, but do you think the tartan pattern is a bit... Stereotyped?
0-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:6=annoyed,And that leaves two remaining!
0-female_removed_major,target:merula,targetStage:4=disappointed,I feel bad for you... I just wanted to come and get some social time... maybe you're not so different.
0-female_removed_major,target:blake,targetStage:4=awkward,Maybe I just don’t get it. Do you, uhm. Get it a lot?
0-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=shocked,S-s-so pink! I don't own any orange panties, b-but maybe I should, to match my hair like you did?
0-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=shocked,Hm. If you didn't have the polka dots, you could be accused of matching your hair, Chiaki.
0-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=shocked,I guess you'll have a matching bra, too...?
0-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,WHAT. WITCHCRAFT. IS. THIS. THIS. IS. THE. COOLEST.
0-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:5=triumphant,Who cares about that!? I want to hear about your shipping and writing!!!
0-female_removed_major,target:ann,targetStage:4=annoyed,Whoa, you don’t do lingerie shoots? How is that any different from swimsuit modeling?
0-female_removed_major,target:ann,targetStage:4=triumphant,Sorry Ann, you have a lot to stare at. What <i>are</i> your measurements? I could fit in you like a mecha! Ann-piloted Futaba would be S-Tier!
0-female_removed_major,target:ann,targetStage:4=happy,Yes! We are a bunch of perverts, and it’s <i>awesome</i>!
0-female_removed_major,target:ann,targetStage:2=shocked,Whoa, weren’t those full tights back when you were in high school? This really is the sexy version of Ann!
0-female_removed_major,target:ann,targetStage:2=excited,Y-you’re gorgeous, Panther. Isn’t that what Mona always used to say? It’s truth though, huh?
0-female_removed_major,target:ann,targetStage:2=annoyed,Well, err… Ann, lesson learned, right?
0-female_removed_major,target:meg,targetStage:5=interested,You took your pants off first? Whoa, that's kinda clever.
0-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4=mad,Oh come on, a-aren't we trying to be sexy?
0-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6=triumphant,You keep taking damage, and getting more naked. Aww yiss. Touhou is <i>so</i> fun.
0-female_removed_major,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=disappointed,I feel pretty bad about this, Kyoko.
0-female_removed_major,target:monika,targetStage:4=interested,Unless you're not actually Japanese... It's okay, I don't look super Japanese either, so I figured I'd just assume you were!
0-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:5=happy,<i>Phew!</i> At least your Persona is okay! I don't think I've ever seen one like that! What's its name?

0-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:ann=annoyed,Even this Ann isn’t that protective of her chest, and look at her! Her stack overflows, if you know what I mean.
0-female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:5=triumphant,Oho! Noir, you have a thing for ~player~? I'm really surprised. ~player~ seems more like <i>my</i> type!

0-female_removed_major,target:raven,targetStage:3=excited,I-I-I don't like shadows. I'm so used to fighting them. But that hairstyle looks really easy to take care of, at least!
0-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan=happy,Well, bigger boobs, but shorter hair. Huh. I guess we should have some differences.
0-female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:4=interested,Hmm... Saving the big stuff for last? You're barely even wet, Haru! Er. I think. I'm kind of... turned on.

1-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=awkward,If you want me to look away, I can respect someone’s trauma--
1-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=triumphant,But now you’re gonna lose!
1-female_removing_major,target:blake,targetStage:3=disappointed,Why would you read about it in a book when there’s <i>so</i> much better animated fare out there?
1-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:0,totalExposed:-0=shocked,Whoa! What a power play! Pinkie, you really like to tank, don't you?
1-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:0,totalExposed:1-5=happy,Oh! Is Pinkie Pie rubberbanding?
1-female_removing_major,target:hanako,targetStage:4,targetSayingMarker:yesterday=interested,Y-yeah?
1-female_removing_major,target:annie,targetStage:3=disappointed,B-b-because you’re awfully concerned with hiding your chest…
1-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:4=shocked,Oh no! I'm sorry, Pathfinder! I didn't think your Persona was suffering from a status effect! Quick! Use a Nohar-M!
1-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:4=happy,Oh! Clever, starting from bottom and going up. That's an unusual trace route...
1-female_removing_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=awkward,I kind of hate shirts that button up. It should be one smooth piece of fabric, IMO.
1-female_removing_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1=interested,Pinkie! Pinkie Pie! Can you teach me how to be more confident?
1-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:4=interested,That's actually kind of clever. We already know what your panties look like, so this has to be... Way less embarrassing, right?
1-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:4=interested,Well, we've already seen your panties... But it's brave of you to keep going, right?
1-female_removing_major,target:zone-tan=awkward,Without your shoes or tights you seem petite like me.
1-female_removing_major,target:meia,marker:metaverse=interested,My preferred outfit was my black jumpsuit from the Metaverse!
1-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2=interested,I just can't see a reason to take off your dress first otherwise.
1-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:3=interested,E-er, if it makes you feel better, Saki, I-- I um, have a-a-an--
1-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:5=nyoro,I can promise you, Miko, some Japanese  women didn't even wear underwear to this game. Mwehehehe.
1-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=shocked,So how does that Lucky Charm thing of yours work, Marinette? It doesn’t seem to do much good now!
1-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=excited,Does it help you get critical hits or something? Or maybe just increases drop rate? Ha! Get it, because you’re dropping your pants next!
1-female_removing_major,target:uravity,targetStage:4=excited,Oh, it's just an easy, friendship-building question...
1-female_removing_major,target:merula,targetStage:4=nyoro,Well, time to see your underwear... at least you were smart enough to wear some. Mweheheh.
1-female_removing_major,target:miko,targetStage:4=nyoro,Have you considered...
1-female_removing_major,target:navi,targetStage:0=interested,Oh! And now she's... removing her... Per...sona?
1-female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2=interested,Oh, you're taking off your hood...?
1-female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2=interested,That bra doesn't even look comfortable. Why didn't you just go naked, Raven?
1-female_removing_major,target:ann,targetStage:1=disappointed,Yikes, Ann. You’re going all out this game!
1-female_removing_major,target:ann,targetStage:1=interested,Hmm… I’d love to try on that hoodie! I bet we’d look cute. By we, I mean me, of course.
1-female_removing_major,target:merula,targetStage:3=awkward,Um... Merula... are you a little... shy?
1-female_removing_major,target:ann,targetStage:3=annoyed,Hmm. Ann, this is just like… Adding… Oh. Okay, right. You’re mostly good with languages… Which is to say your t-t-tongue, right?
1-female_removing_major,target:ann,targetStage:3=awkward,Sorry if that was mean, Ann.
1-female_removing_major,target:ann,targetStage:3=triumphant,Oof. Ann, I think you need a Bead to come back from this. Of either variety!
1-female_removing_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:2=interested,Whoa... do I look that cool when I enter the metaverse!?
1-female_removing_major,target:morrigan,targetStage:2=annoyed,I still don’t trust you! Even if those are cool leggings!
1-female_removed_major=awkward,I’m trying to contribute!
1-female_removed_major=triumphant,I think I’m a lot better at the game part than the stripping part.
1-female_removed_major=interested,You’re a bit better at the stripping than the cards, ~name~.
1-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:uravity,alsoPlayingSaidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity,saidMarker:saki_befriend_furavity=interested,Yeah! Saki, what kind of code name would you use for our makeup/karaoke/dinner/drinking raid?
1-female_removed_major,target:ann,targetStage:4=annoyed,Whoa, you don’t do lingerie shoots? How is that any different from swimsuit modeling?
1-female_removed_major,target:ann,targetStage:4=triumphant,Sorry Ann, you have a lot to stare at. What <i>are</i> your measurements? I could fit in you like a mecha! Ann-piloted Futaba would be S-Tier!
1-female_removed_major,target:ann,targetStage:4=happy,Yes! We are a bunch of perverts, and it’s <i>awesome</i>!
1-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:3=interested,Cute panties, though.
1-female_removed_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:2=triumphant,I can coach you at games, but you can teach me so much! We dressed kind of similarly and everything too!
1-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:5=mad,Oh what the hell? Wh-wh-where’d these boobs come from?! And you’re not traumatized at all! Noob!
1-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:6=annoyed,And that leaves two remaining!
1-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:4,alsoPlaying:ann=annoyed,Even this Ann isn’t that protective of her chest, and look at her! Her stack overflows, if you know what I mean.
1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,saidMarker:persona_mari=interested,Marinette! You’re a Persona user, and Tikki must be your trickster!

1-female_removed_major,target:ann,targetStage:2=shocked,Whoa, weren’t those full tights back when you were in high school? This really is the sexy version of Ann!
1-female_removed_major,target:ann,targetStage:2=excited,Y-you’re gorgeous, Panther. Isn’t that what Mona always used to say? It’s truth though, huh?
1-female_removed_major,target:ann,targetStage:2=annoyed,Well, err… Ann, lesson learned, right?
1-female_removed_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1,totalExposed:1-5=annoyed,You know, like in video games? Where you're behind and you catch up super fast?
1-female_removed_major,target:pinkie_pie,targetStage:1,totalExposed:0=annoyed,<i>Tanking</i>, Pinkie Pie! You know, you keep attention on you so other people can do their things!
1-female_removed_major,target:blake,targetStage:4=awkward,Maybe I just don’t get it. Do you, uhm. Get it a lot?
1-female_removed_major,target:aimee,targetStage:1=excited,WHAT. WITCHCRAFT. IS. THIS. THIS. IS. THE. COOLEST.
1-female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:4=interested,Hmm... Saving the big stuff for last? You're barely even wet, Haru! Er. I think. I'm kind of... turned on.
1-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=shocked,S-s-so pink! I don't own any orange panties, b-but maybe I should, to match my hair like you did?
1-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=shocked,Hm. If you didn't have the polka dots, you could be accused of matching your hair, Chiaki.
1-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:5=shocked,I guess you'll have a matching bra, too...?
1-female_removed_major,target:merula,targetStage:6=nyoro,Looks like someone's new to PvP.
1-female_removed_major,target:annie,targetStage:4=disappointed,Even Ann isn’t that protective! Um, my Ann. My friend Ann!
1-female_removed_major,target:merula,targetStage:4=disappointed,I feel bad for you... I just wanted to come and get some social time... maybe you're not so different.
1-female_removed_major,target:d.va,targetStage:4=interested,You make it look really hard to take off though. Your underwear looks... hot. Because fire. LOL
1-female_removed_major,target:merula,targetStage:5=triumphant,Oho! Were you <i>trying</i> to look sexy, instead of <i>being</i> sexy? L-like me!
1-female_removed_major,target:marinette,targetStage:2,saidMarker:sentai_mari=interested,Whoa! Like one of my sentai shows!
1-female_removed_major,target:chiaki,targetStage:6=shocked,Those are like a raid boss!

1-female_removed_major,target:hanako,targetStage:4=nyoro,You look hot, Hanako!
1-female_removed_major,target:meg,targetStage:5=interested,You took your pants off first? Whoa, that's kinda clever.
1-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:5=triumphant,Mwehehehe. Your plan to be innosexy--innocent sexy-- is very clever, Saki!
1-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:5=triumphant,Mwehehehe. I'm going to steal the best parts of your plan for myself, Saki! Keep being brilliant!
1-female_removed_major,target:sola,targetStage:3=shocked,W-w-what? Your boobs! They're huge! That means you have huge sex appeal!
1-female_removed_major,target:meg,targetStage:6=awkward,Hmmurmrhm... I know most redheads are from Europe, but do you think the tartan pattern is a bit... Stereotyped?
1-female_removed_major,target:monika,targetStage:4=interested,Unless you're not actually Japanese... It's okay, I don't look super Japanese either, so I figured I'd just assume you were!
1-female_removed_major,target:navi,targetStage:1=shocked,Oh! A sprite?! I didn't know this was taking place in the Metaverse!
1-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:5=happy,<i>Phew!</i> At least your Persona is okay! I don't think I've ever seen one like that! What's its name?
1-female_removed_major,target:uravity,targetStage:5=happy,What <i>iiiiiiiiiis</i> your fetish, Ochako? C'mon, you gotta tell me!
1-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4=shocked,A thong...? Hrhmgnrumn. I guess if you have the butt for it...
1-female_removed_major,target:meia=awkward,It’s like getting a full body hug. Now it’s more like, a full body-not hug.
1-female_removed_major,target:morrigan,targetStage:3=shocked,Oh no, the succubus is summoning bats! Quick, someone use area spells!
1-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:5=gremlin,Git gud?
1-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan=happy,Well, bigger boobs, but shorter hair. Huh. I guess we should have some differences.
1-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:5=triumphant,Who cares about that!? I want to hear about your shipping and writing!!!
1-female_removed_major,target:ryuko,targetStage:3=gremlin,I suppose you <i>are</i> wearing less now, but OMG that was SO COOL!!!
1-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:4,marker:saki_friendship=mad,I didn't wear a bra or panties to seem sexy! I'm as awkward as you are! You can do this! I believe in you and I'll be your friend after this!
1-female_removed_major,target:kyoko,targetStage:5=disappointed,I feel pretty bad about this, Kyoko.
1-female_removed_major,target:haru,targetStage:5=triumphant,Oho! Noir, you have a thing for ~player~? I'm really surprised. ~player~ seems more like <i>my</i> type!
1-female_removed_major,target:miko,targetStage:6=triumphant,You keep taking damage, and getting more naked. Aww yiss. Touhou is <i>so</i> fun.
1-female_removed_major,target:lotte,targetStage:4=mad,Oh come on, a-aren't we trying to be sexy?

-2-female_removed_major,target:ann,targetStage:4=annoyed,Whoa, you don’t do lingerie shoots? How is that any different from swimsuit modeling?
-2-female_removed_major,target:ann,targetStage:4=triumphant,Sorry Ann, you have a lot to stare at. What <i>are</i> your measurements? I could fit in you like a mecha! Ann-piloted Futaba would be S-Tier!
-2-female_removed_major,target:ann,targetStage:4=happy,Yes! We are a bunch of perverts, and it’s <i>awesome</i>!

-2-female_removed_major,target:navi,targetStage:1=shocked,Oh! A sprite?! I didn't know this was taking place in the Metaverse!
-2-female_removed_major,target:mahiru,targetStage:4=shocked,A thong...? Hrhmgnrumn. I guess if you have the butt for it...

-2-female_removed_major,target:monika,targetStage:4=interested,Unless you're not actually Japanese... It's okay, I don't look super Japanese either, so I figured I'd just assume you were!
-2-female_removed_major,target:zone-tan=awkward,Too warm! I maintain thigh highs are sexier.
-2-female_removed_major,target:meia=awkward,It’s like getting a full body hug. Now it’s more like, a full body-not hug.

-2-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:5=triumphant,Mwehehehe. I'm going to steal the best parts of your plan for myself, Saki! Keep being brilliant!
-2-female_removed_major,target:natsuki,targetStage:5=interested,Mrmermmrerm... (<i>Should I tell her?</i>) I um... actually don't own very many pairs of clothes, so I think I can relate?
-2-female_removed_major,target:saki,targetStage:4,marker:saki_friendship=mad,I didn't wear a bra or panties to seem sexy! I'm as awkward as you are! You can do this! I believe in you and I'll be your friend after this!

-1-male_removed_major,target:9s,targetStage:4=shocked,The only thing worth stealing is hearts. And information you can use to propel yourself to a more successful state in life.
-1-female_removing_major=interested,Oooh…~name~, that’d be huge on me!
-1-female_removing_major=shocked,How are you still in so much clothes!? SO MUCH CLOTHES, ~name~!

-1-female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2=interested,Oh, you're taking off your hood...?
-1-female_removing_major,target:raven,targetStage:2=interested,That bra doesn't even look comfortable. Why didn't you just go naked, Raven?
-1-female_removing_major,target:sola,targetStage:2=interested,I just can't see a reason to take off your dress first otherwise.
-1-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:4=interested,That's actually kind of clever. We already know what your panties look like, so this has to be... Way less embarrassing, right?
-1-female_removing_major,target:saki,targetStage:4=interested,Well, we've already seen your panties... But it's brave of you to keep going, right?

-1-female_removing_major,target:merula,targetStage:5=gremlin,It's okay to like this. Losing the game, I mean. Mwheheh.
-1-female_removing_major,target:aimee,targetStage:0=shocked,Gah! This isn’t the Metaverse, you shouldn’t be using that here!
-1-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=shocked,So how does that Lucky Charm thing of yours work, Marinette? It doesn’t seem to do much good now!
-1-female_removing_major,target:marinette,targetStage:4=excited,Does it help you get critical hits or something? Or maybe just increases drop rate? Ha! Get it, because you’re dropping your pants next!

1-female_crotch_is_visible,target:ryuko=gremlin,I don't do that, but I think it makes sense. With a pervy metaverse outfit like yours, Pathfinder, I'm not surprise you're into some kinky dates!

#OPPONENT MASTURBATING
#When an opponent is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must pay the penalty by masturbating in front of everyone.
#The "must_masturbate" line is for just before it happens, and the "start_masturbating" line immediately follows.
#The "masturbating" line will be spoken a little after the opponent has started but before they climax.
#When the opponent climaxes, your character will say the "finished_masturbating" line.

#stage-generic lines that will be used for every individual stage that doesn't have a line written

#SELF MASTURBATING
#If your character is naked and loses a hand, they have lost the game and must masturbate.
#These lines only come up in the relevant stages, so you don't need to include the stage numbers here. Just remember which stage is which when you make the images. The "starting" image is still in the naked stage.
#The "finished_masturbating" line will repeat many times if the game is not yet finished. This plays as opponents comment on the how good their hands are.

-2-masturbating,alsoPlaying:sei,notSaidMarker:seim,marker:seim=mast1,Er, no thanks Sei. I-I-I’m trying to be flirty, but I’m not into you like that!

-2-heavy_masturbating=mast6,Unf-ah-s-so good!
-2-heavy_masturbating=mast7,Is this what you came here to see? M-me, c-c-coming?!
