        <note id="17">This is based specifically on the fact that Aaravi has a lawyer outfit with the same design as Franzisca's.</note>
        <note id="93">The Damien reason isn't meant to make sense, it's Aaravi accidentally voicing her thoughts</note>
        <note id="95">Aaravi exists in a universe where video games exist as media, but are also accurate depictions of the lives of the characters in them, who exist seperately. Meeting someone she fought in a game is her equivalent of meeting a niche celebrity</note>
        <note id="96">Aaravi doesn't understand what Monika's getting at - she assumes she's trying to correct her about the nature of the strip poker game</note>
        <note id="97">This chain is so that Aaravi engages with what Charlie's saying, and is not intended to be responded to.</note>
        <note id="98">This chain is so that Aaravi engages with what Charlie's saying, and is not intended to be responded to.</note>
        <note id="99">This chain is so that Aaravi engages with what Charlie's saying, and is not intended to be responded to.</note>
        <note id="100">This is poking fun at the JRPG trope that the church is always evil - Aaravi's not some militant athiest, it's just that her life experience has literally been that the people who run any church she visits are almost always behind something evil</note>
        <note id="101">Aaravi is admitting this because she's trying to insinuate that she hasn't played the Resident Evil games. She doesn't know that Leon isn't aware of his meta-existence as a video game hero in her world</note>
        <note id="102">The original of this line wouldn't fire at Kumatora, since she doesn't have the fighter tag, so she gets her own special version!</note>
        <note id="105">I think Aaravi would be fine with this - the issue with her father wasn't that he was from another culture, it was that he broke her mother's heart by leaving his wife and two young kids without warning. Leon seems reliable to her, so she doesn't have an issue with the thought of him and Hu Tao being together</note>
        <note id="94">If Meia calls her out on this being an unfair judgement, Aaravi will back down and admit fault</note>
        <note id="106">If Meia points this out as being unproductive, Aaravi will accept that she's being difficult and try to cut down on her use of jargon</note>
        <note id="107">Potentially of note: Aaravi is 22, because Spooky High doesn't filter by age. </note>
        <note id="108">Aaravi doesn't have any alt costumes in the works at time of writing, this is just future-proofing</note>
        <note id="109">Aaravi doesn't realise that she's missing Meia's point here</note>
        <note id="110">"V" is Aaravi's canonical nickname for Valerie Oberlin, the shopkeeper in Monster Prom</note>
        <note id="112">PokeMan is an actual canon card and video game in the Monster Prom universe, and is short for "Pocket Humans". Competitive Tarot is also canon, properly known as "Full Battle Arcana Tarot"</note>
        <note id="113">Yes, this is completely insane. Nothing Aaravi does has to make sense, and no canon explanation is ever given as to why the characters of Monster Prom, some of whom are hundreds of years old, are going to a high school. It's just handwaved for the sake of comedy</note>
        <note id="114">I know it's low-hanging fruit, but "thesaurus is a dinosaur" jokes are funny to me</note>
        <note id="121">The first part of these lines is Aaravi using meta-knowledge about the Pathfinder System calling its collections of monsters "Bestiaries", rather than D&amp;D's term, "Monster Manuals". However, the Pathfinder Society actually exists within Golarion, and is a collection of adventurers, like Aaravi, so it would be fair for Arue to assume she's talking about the Society rather than being confused about the game system that she wouldn't know about. Not to tell you how to write your own character or anything, just a lore note and suggestion</note>
        <note id="122">To be clear, Aaravi is a dumbass and doesn't realise what Dorothy is really suggesting. She'll get there eventually</note>
        <note id="123">It feels like a shame to basically ignore such a great pickup line from Dorothy, but I feel like missing the obvious flirting because she fixates on a completely trivial point and then floundering comedically is more in-character for Aaravi</note>
        <note id="124">Feel free to have Dorothy call her out on anti-synthetic prejudice, and/or demonstrate exactly how good she is at her job. Aaravi has a masochistic streak and a thing for being tied up, if you intend to go that route</note>
        <note id="251">Aaravi's trying to see what does and does not work to provoke interest from Darkness</note>
        <note id="191">I, the writer, know that all of the Galarian curries are just called "x curry". Aaravi does not. This will infuriate her</note>
        <note id="208">Might be worth adding a collectible for this, along with a specific, player-controllable circumstance that will trigger it for certain. If player personality tags get added, they're a good option for this</note>
        <note id="217">For my own notes and anyone else reading this: the phrase "I might be looking for supports, but I'm not &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; desperate" is probably going to come up later down this chain</note>
        <note id="218">Let me know if you want markers on these - I didn't put them on because these are responses to Lux, but if Lux would want to respond to any of these criticisms, just let me know and I can throw some markers on here</note>
        <note id="220">Not sure if you already have a direction planned for this, but the idea of a "bad end" in a porn game - losing combat and becoming a sexual object for the victor - is very much up Aaravi's alley, though she would vehemently deny such a thing</note>
        <note id="221">Aaravi has body image issues, both about her lack of height and chest, and some of her monster features, like her eyes, hair, and ears. Accordingly, she has a hard time coming up with a feature she likes about herself</note>
        <note id="229">This target *should* be able to work on either ZLS girl, provided there is no ZLS girl at the table who does not have the undead tag. I'd have liked to futureproof it, but as it turns out, checking that there's nobody from a franchise *without* a particular tag is hard. The extra tabs with explicit targeting are mostly for the sake of having it show up as a target and not a filter</note>
        <note id="230">Is this reaction specifically written to be as annoying to Sakura as possible, by suggesting that Saki was exactly as good at pretending to be not a zombie as she was? It might be. Aaravi works on comedy logic</note>
        <note id="247">If you need any inspiration here, Windwheel Asters from the overworld and Hurricane Seeds from boss fights are Sucrose's in-game ascension materials, so they're good picks for this. Any material from another nation (especially Inazuma) would work too</note>
        <note id="248">Please note: Aaravi's dialogue does not reflect the views of her writer. Itadaki Seiki is *good* hentai</note>
        <note id="250">Aaravi does not have the self awareness to appreciate that this isn't a topic Arueshalae wants to discuss</note>
        <note id="252">She's lying. She still has fears, they're just conceptual now, and largely based around social situations</note>
